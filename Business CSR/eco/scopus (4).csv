Using a cross-country case approach, this article explores the role of stakeholders in the marketing capability-building processes of INVs in Ireland, Sweden, and Denmark. The study reveals that different stakeholders play a critical role in influencing how INVs build their marketing capabilities to respond effectively to the dynamic nature of international markets in which they operate. The results show that different stakeholder groups (allied, cooperative, neutral, and entrepreneur) can influence the learning processes (single-, double-, and triple-loop) of the firm and can determine the nature of dynamic marketing capabilities (incremental, renewing, and regenerative) needed to create and sustain international competitive advantage. Furthermore, ""effectuation logic"" can explain how entrepreneurs manage and leverage stakeholder relationships in marketing capability processes to cocreate value for the firm. By incorporating dynamic capabilities, stakeholder, and learning theories, this study offers a dynamic, process-oriented model for INV research and provides much-needed qualitative insights into the dynamic capabilities theory of the firm. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Case method; Dynamic capabilities; International new ventures; Marketing capabilities; Stakeholders",

However, the social behaviors (i.e. parenting behaviors, marital behaviors) governing attachments can also be studied in the light of recent research on ""reward circuits"" in neurobiology. Recent studies have shown that social behaviors and attachments are strengthened by the activation of these circuits, which involve structures such as the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens and use dopamine as a neuromediator. There is increasing evidence to suggest that addictions are a result of these mechanisms (associated with the reinforcement of motivated behavior, such as eating, drinking, mating, or car-ing for one's children) being ""bypassed"". Neuroimaging has shown that the results of studies on rodents may also apply to humans. Neuroimaging studies provide further evidence of the processes underlying social relationships, which have unique ramifications among many species (including humans).","""Reward circuit""; Addiction; Motivation; Parenting behaviors; Social attachments","Rodentia"

The result was the worst fracture of the US financial system since the Great Depression. Credit rating agencies (CRAs) in particular have come under intense scrutiny as a result of this latest disaster, both domestically and internationally, including many congressional inquiries and government investigations. Most of the public and scholarly discussions about CRAs focus on reforming the financial system so that the crisis of the magnitude of the 2008 disaster will not happen again. An important overtone of industry criticisms includes a sense of ethical impropriety on the part of CRAs and ethical uncertainty about the institutional mechanisms that are currently in place.

Corporate boards, aspiring to motivate executives to make value-maximizing decisions, often tie an executive's earnings to stock price performance through stock or option awards. However, this engenders a significant ethical dilemma for many executives who are uncomfortable with sizable, firm-specific risk and desire to reduce it through hedging activities. Recent research has shown that executive hedging has become more prevalent. In essence, managers are unwinding the acute economic incentive to act in the best interest of the owners. This appears to violate the spirit of the compensation contract and from a normative standpoint, is not how executives should act. In this article, we describe how some executives are acting in regard to this issue (descriptive ethics), how they should act (normative ethics) and how they can be helped to get from what they are doing, to what they should be doing (prescriptive ethics). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business Ethics; Ethics; Executive Compensation; Managerial Hedging",

Such a social contract understanding of privacy could produce more practical guidance for organizations and managers who have employees, users, and future customers all with possibly different conceptions of privacy across contexts. However, this theoretical suggestion, while intuitively appealing, has not been empirically examined. This study validates a social contract approach to privacy by examining whether and how privacy norms vary across communities and contractors. The findings from this theoretical examination support the use of contractual business ethics to understand privacy in research and in practice. As predicted, insiders to a community had significantly different understandings of privacy norms as compared to outsiders. In addition, all respondents held different privacy norms across hypothetical contexts, thereby suggesting privacy norms are contextually understood within a particular community of individuals. The findings support two conclusions. First, individuals hold different privacy norms without necessarily having diminished expectations of privacy. Individuals differed on the factors they considered important in calculating privacy expectations, yet all groups had robust privacy expectations across contexts. Second, outsiders have difficulty in understanding the privacy norms of a particular community. For managers and scholars, this renders privacy expectations more difficult to identify at a distance or in deductive research. The findings speak directly to the needs of organizations to manage a diverse set of privacy issues across stakeholder groups. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Contractual business ethics; Factorial vignette methodology; Privacy; Social contract theory; Survey",

Addressing this challenge, our research investigates whether a few demographic variables and psychographic variables reduce unethical sales behaviors (USBs) in Canada, Mexico, and the USA. Further, using literatures associated with business ethics, national culture, and customer orientation advocacy, we hypothesize why sales managers should expect similarities and differences in USBs between countries. We tested hypotheses using a sales contest scenario and six USBs, examining survey responses from 948 business-to-business salespeople of a multinational company's sales force in Canada, Mexico, and the USA. The results reveal that several psychographic variables (such as commitment, relationship to sales manager, and achievement need) affect salespeople's tendency to engage in USBs differently in each country. In addition, business ethics, individualism, and customer orientation advocacy associated with each country can be used to anticipate similarities and differences in USBs between countries. This research offers important theoretical contributions and implications for more effectively managing sales forces and reducing USBs across countries. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Achievement need; Commitment; Compensation; Customer orientation; Leadership; National culture; Sales ethics; Sales management; Salespeople; Unethical sales behavior",

Among the three pillars of sustainability consisting of environmental, social and economic longevity and foresight of a firm, we focus on the environmental component. Specifically, basing our arguments on the resource-based view of the firm, we hypothesize the impact of environmental management on plant performance. Environmental initiatives considered include ISO 14000 certification, pollution prevention, recycling of materials, and waste reduction; plant performance is assessed with the dimensions of the four competitive capabilities of quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost. Further, building on the theory of performance frontiers, we investigate these relationships across plants located in different economic regions of the world (plants are classified into emerging, developing and industrialized regions). We suggest that recent emphasis on these environmental initiatives has been greatest among plants located in emerging economies, compared to their counterparts in industrialized and developing nations. In addition, we contend that the influence of these initiatives is greatest for plants located in emerging and developing economies when compared to plants in industrialized nations. These notions are tested with data collected from 1211 plants located in these three economic regions.

Using data from two empirical studies that were designed to study the practise of Swedish buyers in addressing social and environmental issues in their respective supply chains, we demonstrate that both fields offer vital insights about how companies can and do exercise environmental and social responsibility in their respective supply chains. We suggest that one can better integrate these two perspectives on governance in the supply chain by acknowledging that responsibility in the supply chain can both be exercised through choice and through inter-organisational management.

In particular, based on the five-dimensional structure of LSR framework, we propose that clan culture, business ethics, pressures from customers, suppliers, competitors and law/regulations are important antecedents of five dimensions of LSR. A mail survey was conducted in China and a total of 162 firm-level questionnaires were returned. Structural equation modeling was employed to test our theory. The results support our hypotheses that clan culture and business ethics of a firm have significant impacts on all the five dimensions of LSR.

China and the Chinese government reached an impasse that produced a large-scale, transnational conflict that reached a head ostensibly over state-mandated censorship, ultimately prompting Google to withdraw from the mainland Chinese market and redirect its activities to Hong Kong. We track Google's experience in China, both to explore its strategies and to consider the implications for corporate social responsibility. We situate Google's drastic decision to withdraw entirely from mainland China in the complex multiplicity of ethical, cultural, and political conflicts that affect this particular case. On a broader level, the incident raises the question of how multinational corporations (MNCs) can achieve corporate growth while negotiating the highly sensitive sociopolitical and institutional environments of foreign nations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethic; China; Copyright; Corporate social responsibility; Google; Internet search engine; Privacy",

A probable cause of these incidents is a lack of business ethics in the suppliers concerned. In the literature much has been suggested on the use of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to improve firms' ethical behaviors and on the use of supplier development (SD) to improve suppliers' capabilities. This research integrates the literature on CSR and SD to develop a new approach, called socially responsible supplier development (SRSD), to address suppliers' ethical problems. SRSD suggests leveraging a buying firms concerted supplier development efforts to improve its important suppliers' capabilities in CSR implementation. We develop and validate scales for measuring SRSD practices. In addition, we provide empirical evidence on the validity of existing CSR scales for Chinese manufacturing firms. Our results are based on analysis of the data of 160 pairs of buyer-supplier relationships in four manufacturing industries in China. The results indicate that all the scale items possess adequate reliability and validity to reflect SRSD and CSR. We also discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Business and civil society actors play a dominant role in initiating and governing 'sustainable supply chain governance systems' (SSCG systems). Within specific product markets we see the emergence of various competing SSCG systems.This has led to debates on effectiveness, transparency and legitimacy of these forms of self-governance in the market. These developments also call for a debate on appropriate roles for (national) governments.Most of the academic literature in this field focuses on methodologies for supply chain governance and their impacts, but hardly addresses the roles taken on by governments and effectiveness of possible government interventions. This article combines analysis of market dynamics in the timber and coffee product chains with policy analysis, integrating approaches from the research fields of sustainable business and policy analysis.The article shows how competition between various sustainable supply chain governance systems in The Netherlands has resulted in recent market breakthroughs, while initially government interventions were very limited and diverse.The article suggests an approach for more systematic analysis of these dynamics and the roles of various actors, by identifying both the 'public policy cycle' and the 'private policy cycle'. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Certification; Global trade; Government; Integrated product policy; Supply chain; Sustainable products","academic research; certification; environmental economics; global trade; governance approach; integrated approach; market conditions; policy analysis; product development; self government; sustainability; Netherlands"

It draws on an ethnographic study of human resource managers in a global organization to provide a theorized account of situated moral agency. This account suggests that within contemporary organizations, institutional structures-particularly the structures of Anglo-American market capitalism-threaten and constrain the capacity of HR managers to exercise moral agency and hence engage in ethical behaviour. The contextualized explanation of HR management action directly addresses the question of whether HRM is inherently unethical. The discussion draws on MacIntyre's (Philosophy 74:311-329, 1999, After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory, Duckworth, 2000) conceptualization of moral agency within contemporary social structures. In practice, HR managers embody roles that may not be wholly compartmentalized. Alternative institutional structures can provide HR managers with a vocabulary of motives for people-centred HRM and widen the scope for the exercising of moral agency, when enacted within reflective relational spaces that provide milieus for critical questioning of logics and values. This article aims to contribute to and extend debate on whether HRM can ever be ethical, and provide a means of reconnecting business ethics with longstanding concerns in critical management studies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Human resource management; Institutional theory; Moral agency; Relational sociology; Relational spaces",

They seem committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices that are aimed at preventing or minimising the harm associated with their activities. Our empirical research employed a sample of 209 university student online gamblers, who took part in an online survey. Our findings suggest that the extent of online problem gambling is substantial and that it adversely impacts on the gambler's mental and physical health, social relationships and academic performance. Online problem gambling seems to be related to the time spent on the Internet and gambling online, parental/peer gambling and binge drinking. As our findings show that there are harmful repercussions associated with online gambling, we argue that companies in this controversial sector cannot reach the higher level of CSR achieved by other industries. Nevertheless, they can gain legitimacy on the basis of their CSR engagement at a transactional level, and so, by meeting their legal and ethical commitments and behaving with transparency and fairness, the integrity of the company can be ensured. We also argue that current failures in the implementation and control of CSR policies, the reliance on revenue from problem gamblers' losses, and controversial marketing activities appear to constitute the main obstacles in the prevention or minimisation of harm related to online gambling. As online gambling companies must be responsible for the harm related to their activities, we suggest that CSR policies should be fully implemented, monitored and clearly reported; all forms of advertising should be reduced substantially; and unfair or misleading promotional techniques should be banned. The industry should not rely on revenue from problem gamblers, nor should their behaviour be reinforced by marketing activities (i. e. rewards). We realise, however, that it is unrealistic to expect the online gambling industry to prioritise harm prevention over revenue maximisation. Policy makers and regulators, therefore, would need to become involved if the actions suggested above are to be undertaken. CSR is paramount to minimise harm and provide a healthier user experience in this business sector, but it also poses marketing dilemmas. We support a global collaborative approach for the online gambling industry, as harm related to gambling is a public health issue. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CSR and gambling addiction; CSR in controversial industries; CSR in online gambling; Marketing activities in the online gambling industry",

Data for the study came from a survey of 1170 Hong Kong Chinese adults. Results show that the experienced impact tended to raise the participation, which in turn appeared to encourage the caring. These results support the functional explanation, which holds that the fiscal crisis generates a need for functions of voluntary associations. Meanwhile, the results are at odds with the resource thesis, which expects that the crisis would deprive resources required for social engagement.

The images of humanitarian organisations distributing food and medicines under the protection of military forces, or aid workers and military working together to construct refugee camps, set up field hospitals, provide emergency water and sanitation, has become more frequent. The media coverage from natural and man-made disasters in recent years, has heightened the expectation of a smooth interaction between humanitarian organisations and military forces. Due to fundamental differences between international military forces, humanitarian and development organisations (in terms of the principles and doctrines guiding their work, their agendas, operating styles, and roles), the area of civil military coordination in disaster relief has proven to be more difficult than other interagency relationships. In order to address this, the authors outline the usage of systems analysis and design technique (SADT) to explain how a more effective coordination of humanitarian operations by military and civilian organisations involved in disaster relief can be achieved across the range of humanitarian aid lifecycle phases. Furthermore the authors provide an empirical comparison of military and humanitarian organisation partnership evaluation criteria for (CIMIC). Finally, the authors then develop and present how the SADT approach can inform the development of a systems dynamics model using systems archetypes (SA) to describe the rich interactions between stakeholders and involved components.

Second, the paper examines what use large firms that are headquartered in two OFCs-Bermuda and the Cayman Islands-make of formal CSR tools. The emerging duplicity in tax haven-based companies professing social responsibility highlights once more the political nature of CSR, where at least some firms and/or industries can successfully limit government power to enact regulation as well as shape the discourse around CSR.

Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high.

A survey of 225 US university students composing a culturally diverse sample revealed that these social norms and network variables have interactive effects on credit card overspending.

The question can be asked whether-in a spirit of reciprocity, loyalty and fairness-stakeholders should treat the corporation in a fair and responsible way. This study based on different definitions of stakeholders argues that various stakeholder attributes differ for different categories of stakeholders. This analysis presumes that the attribute of stakeholder reciprocity can probably be restricted to real stakeholders, labelled stakeowners: genuine stakeholders with a legitimate stake, the loyal partners who strive for mutual benefits. Stakeowners own and deserve a stake in the firm. Stakeholder reciprocity could be an innovative criterion in the corporate governance debate as to who should be accorded representation on the board.

I have attempted to answer these calls by developing a theoretical framework that links together stakeholder management, stakeholder commitment to cooperate with the firm, key decision makers' ethical commitment, and firm strategy. Starting from the basic assumption that managers cannot meet all stakeholders' demands immediately and in a tailored manner, I contend, first, that an ambidextrous approach to stakeholder management is conducive to stakeholders' commitment to cooperate for the sustainable well-being of the firm and, second, that firm strategy and key decision makers' ethical commitment moderate the relationship between an ambidextrous stakeholder management and stakeholder commitment to cooperate. Furthermore, drawing on this theoretical framework, I attempt to address the call for the integration of strategy and ethics by proposing a three-level conceptual model that distinguishes the objectives, the field, and the levers of integration.

Non-whites were disadvantaged because of structures that limited their economic and social opportunities, leaving few from this vast group in the formal economy. Black economic empowerment (BEE and its more recent broad-based version) is a policy intervention driven from the economic and industrial complex in government. Aimed directly at addressing the economy's skewed racial profile, BEE calls the private sector to restructure itself and create opportunities for previously disadvantaged individuals (PDIs). The policy requires change to intra and inter-firm relational patterns of capital and control, personnel selection, promotion and development, supplier selection, enterprise development and social engagement. Organisational theory argues that these kinds of intra and inter-firm relational structures and the networks they establish influence who participates in economies and how these people benefit. This argument supports the contention that BEE's focal changes are necessary to open the economy and adjust its racial composition. If the structures that have entrenched patterns of access to economic opportunities remain static they will not allow inclusion of previously excluded groups. The argument could also be used to view BEE as a potential South African growth catalyst. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Entrepreneurship; Growth; South Africa",

The methodology used was based on innovation and social relationships networks. Midsize producers had an average yield of 5.75 t/ha -1, almost three times higher than what smallholders achieved, largely due to their rate of adoption of innovations (INAI), which was 48.22%, in contrast to 12.55% in the other group, and to their excellent trust relations (social capital). Furthermore, the midsize farmers' network is more comprehensive because it has higher density, size and number of links, and a smaller standard deviation. In addition, their centralization index is lower than in the small farmers' network, a fact related with unequal access to information and knowledge.","Adoption rate; Agricultural innovations - Michoacán (Mexico); Corn industry- case studies; Cultivation - economic aspects; Key players; Social capital; Technology; Transmission; Trust relationships; Zea maize; Zea mays",

The framework includes variables that explain underlying mechanisms (i.e., relationship- and value-based mediator variables) of CSR-outcomes relationships and contingency effects (i.e., people-, place-, price-, and profile-based moderator variables) that explain conditions under which the relationship between CSR and its outcomes change. The authors' review reveals important knowledge gaps related to the adoption of different theoretical orientations by researchers studying CSR at different levels of analysis, the need to understand underlying mechanisms linking CSR with outcomes, the need for research at micro levels of analysis (i.e., individuals and teams), and the need for methodological approaches that will help address these substantive knowledge gaps.

As discourses express specific stances expressed by a group of people who share particular beliefs and values, they constitute an important means of restoring organisational legitimacy when social rules and norms have been violated. Using an analytical framework based on legitimacy as a process of reciprocal sense-making and consisting of three levels of analysis which capture the relationship between text and context, we investigate the discourse used by CEOs in their initial and subsequent accounts of the incident. We find that CEOs aim to negotiate a resolution between their initial account and organisational audiences' incongruent interpretations of the event by adopting an ad hoc normative attitude to stakeholders. This manifests itself in the strategic use of the discourse of stakeholder engagement as a means of signalling change, yet maintaining the status quo. It suggests that CEOs strategically use discourse to manufacture organisational audiences' consent regarding the continued operation of the nuclear power plant affected by the incident.

This paper examines the uneasy relationship existing between the strategic 'business model' of CSR and the brand of development it delivers. Using evidence from two multinational extractive industries in Papua New Guinea, we show how weaknesses in CSR practice come from greater emphasis on meeting global 'performance standards' than on the specificities of the social contexts in which strategies are implemented. These weaknesses, we argue, lead to ill-conceived and inappropriate development programmes that generate inequality, fragmentation, and social and economic insecurity.

However, many social groups (local communities, grassroots movement and the church) often strongly oppose new mining projects on the grounds of environmental, ethical and economic concerns. In a situation marked by widespread conflict, mining companies continue operating and develop Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives which are often promoted as a means of contributing to the sustainability and development of the nation. The paper develops a framework to highlight how the principles of stakeholder theory could be used as conceptual and practical guidance for conflict-resolution oriented CSR policies. The framework is further used to analyse two case studies of conflictive mining projects in Argentina. The paper explores how key stakeholders perceive contribution of CSR to welfare and the socio-economic development of mining communities and sustainable development of the nation. It demonstrates that institutional and social stakeholder networks often strongly oppose the idea of voluntary self-regulation implied by CSR in situations characterised by weak governance.

As a consequence, community resistance is suppressed.Voluntary mechanisms such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) advocate community stakeholder engagement in decision making processes as a measure to achieve public accountability. In many developing countries, where there is a lack of transparency and high levels of corruption, the value of this engagement, however, is debatable. Findings from this study indicate that the power relationships which exist between stakeholders in the highly lucrative mining industry override efforts to achieve ""good governance"" through voluntary community engagement. The continuing challenge lies in identifying where the responsibility sits in order to address this power struggle to achieve fair representation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Developing country; Development; Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI); Globalisation; Governance; Large-scale mining; Madagascar; Minerals; Resource rich; Rio Tinto; Trans-national mining","Africa; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Development; Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI); Globalisation; Governance; Large-scale mining; Madagascar; Resource-Rich; Rio Tinto; Trans nationals; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Industry; Minerals; Transparency; accountability; civil society; corporate strategy; decision making; developing world; globalization; governance approach; local government; mining industry; stakeholder; Madagascar"

The importance of industry and firm effects on giving was analyzed with regression models using industry-fixed effects as well as firm strategy variables. The analysis included instrumental variables methodology to account for simultaneity in the charitable giving-profits relationship. Data were gathered from the IRS Corporate Statistics of Income Sourcebook, data that provide firm size class measures covering the entire firm size distribution ranging from small retailers up to large multi-national retail firms. Retailer philanthropy was measured as the ratio of charitable contributions to total receipts. Important findings include a cubic relationship between retailer philanthropy and firm size; industry effects stronger than those observed for retail profit; and the absence of business cycle effects. The empirical research relating retail charitable giving to firm attributes including firm size and advertising, industry and business cycle factors are unique in the business ethics literature. Prior studies regarding the importance of industry on charitable giving utilized data across broad sectors of the economy. Firms from different sectors could be expected to differ in philanthropic approach due to differences in public contact as well as differences in public relations exposure. The strong industry effects reported for this sample of exclusively retail firms, with similar public contact, provide strong evidence for the importance of industry in determining firms' charitable strategies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Firm size; Industry; Philanthropy; Retailing",

The protection of property rights, the enforcement of contracts and an efficient legal system are the pillars of the contemporary rule of law. However, formal institutions cannot function without being internalized by the citizens and without the strong backing of social norms. Morality and social norms are the major elements of the informal institutional structure, the social capital, which is also critical for social welfare and economic development. In this paper we will discuss both the formal and the informal institutional framework of Ancient Athens, which was a free market society with economic problems similar to contemporary market societies. Athenians developed a highly sophisticated legal framework for the protection of private property, the enforcement of contracts and the efficient resolution of disputes. Such an institutional framework functioned effectively, cultivating trust and protecting the security of transactions. This entire system however was based on social norms such as reciprocity, the value of reputation and widely accepted business ethics. Conformity to social norms as well as moral behavior was fostered by social sanction mechanisms (such as stigma) and moral education. The Athenian example is a further proof of the importance of morality and social norms as transaction cost-saving devices even in quite sophisticated legal systems. Their absence or decline leads inevitably to the need for more regulation and litigation and to a growing preference for clear-cut rules instead of discretionary standards. Athenian law was pioneering in the development of rules and institutional mechanisms suitable for the reduction of transaction costs, many of them surviving in the most complex contemporary legal systems. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ancient Athens; Economic growth; Institutions; Legal system; Morality; Social capital; Social norms; Transaction costs",

This is somewhat surprising given that employees are essentially the face of their organization and are largely expected to act as ambassadors for the organization's CSR program (Collier and Esteban in Bus Ethics 16:19-33, 2007). The current research, by conducting depth interviews with employees, builds a better understanding of how employees differentiate between authentic and inauthentic CSR programs, and how these judgments influence their perceptions of the organization. We find that employees rely on two different referent standards to form authenticity judgments-the extent to which the image put forth in the CSR program aligns with the organization's true identity and the extent to which the CSR program itself is developmental. To assess the former, employees draw on cues about resource commitment, alignment between elements of the organization's CSR program, emotional engagement, justice, and embeddedness. The latter assessments are based on the extent to which the organization adopts a leadership role with regards to its CSR initiatives. We also find that perceived authenticity can lead to positive outcomes such as organizational identification and employee connections. This study contributes to the broad literatures on both CSR and authenticity, as well as more specifically adding to the conversation on authenticity as a potentially valuable lens for enriching business ethics theorizing. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Authenticity; Corporate social responsibility; Employee perceptions; Interviews; Organizational self; Socially constructed standard",

This paper contributes to this debate by reporting on a longitudinal evaluation of stakeholder engagement in developing and implementing River Basin Management Planning (RBMP) in Scotland. We illustrate how many of the process and outcome criteria promoted in the literature (the external perspective) appear to be less important to stakeholders than would be expected (the internal perspective).

Although many authors of this approach have reviewed many elements of the model, they have unconditionally accepted several criteria assumed by Freeman (1984) to identify stakeholders. In general, stakeholder authors have assumed that (a) the company establishes dyadic relationships with other agents, and (b) decisions made by a company only have foreseen and direct effects on other agents. These criteria have enabled researchers to understand simple processes. However, they have also prevented researchers from explaining how action comes about, and how responsibility is shared, in many complex processes taking place in contemporary societies. Such complex processes involve many agents, and each decision can generate unexpected effects which accumulate or disseminate. Furthermore, the normative structure governing these processes can affect and/or be affected by the actions of agents.

This article criticizes the distributive character of luck egalitarian theories of justice and fleshes out the central characteristics of an alternative, relational approach to equality. It examines a central objection to distributive theories: that such theories cannot account for the significance of how institutions treat people (as opposed to the outcomes they bring about). I discuss two variants of this objection: first, that distributive theories fail to account for the importance of how institutions cause good shortfalls and, second, that they fail to account for the normative attitude of social and political institutions expressed in different ways of treating people. The article argues that the causal variant of the objection has only very limited reach, and endorses the expressive variant: the attitudes expressed by institutions in their treatment of persons, such as contempt or neglect, generate potentially unjust social relationships and hierarchies. This should be the focus of a relational egalitarian approach to social justice. The article proceeds to explain how it is possible that artificial agents such as institutions have attitudes and how these attitudes are not reducible to those of the individuals that sustain them, and argues that distributive theories cannot be so modified as to account for such attitudes. It concludes by indicating several directions for the development of more worked-out conceptions of relational equality on this basis. © The Author(s) 2011.","expressive attitudes; luck egalitarianism; natural versus social inequalities; relational equality; social justice",

Although commercial and recreational fishermen have actively participated throughout the MLPA implementation process, and research related to California's sport and commercial fisheries has been integrated into the process, pier and shore anglers have been relatively unengaged as stakeholders. This study was completed to generate information about pier angler understanding and sentiment towards marine protected areas (MPAs), as well as to educate anglers on the MLPA implementation process in southern California and inform them on involvement opportunities.

I identify such resistive openings via interrogations of culture (I focus on oft-cited Gandhian ethics here), structure (State policy, organizational strategy, and global/local flows), and agency (subaltern reframing of institutional responsibility, engagement with alternative modes of agency, and deconstructive vigilance). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Culture-centered approach; Emerging economies; India",

It explores the suitability of CSR for addressing social, environmental and economic issues associated with mining in the country. The study is based on interviews with four stakeholder groups in the country: government, civil society, international financial organisations, and mining industry. These are analysed using content and interpretative techniques and supplemented by the content analysis of secondary data from headquarters of mining MNCs. Using the concept of corporate social responsibility orientation (CSRO), the study contrasts the perceptions of major stakeholders and examines adaptation of mining companies' CSRO to local context. It reveals that the CSRO of mining managers in Argentina differs from CSRO developed by global headquarters; and in Argentina companies ""negotiate"" economic, environmental and legal dimensions of CSR with the government. Although companies ""negotiate"" philanthropic responsibilities with the communities, ethical responsibilities are defined by the headquarters and not negotiated locally. The analysis suggests that environmental duties are the critical element of CSR in the mining sector in Argentina. This study treats environment as a separate dimension of corporate responsibility defined as to do ""what is safe for the environment"". © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility orientation; Mining; Stakeholders",

Compliance disclosure is a relatively recent regulatory technique whereby companies are obliged to disclose the extent to which they comply with codes, 'best practice standards' or other extra-legal texts containing norms or prospective norms. Such 'compliance disclosure' obligations are often presented as flexible regulatory alternatives to substantive, command-and-control regulation. However, based on a report on experiences of existing compliance disclosure obligations, this article will identify major weaknesses that prevent them from becoming effective mechanisms to discipline a certain type of behaviour. It will be argued that regulatory recourse to compliance disclosure obligations is nonetheless worthwhile if we view them as mechanisms that can initiate a dialogue about norm interpretation, application and norm desirability. From this perspective, compliance disclosure obligations serve less to discipline companies by making corporate practices transparent, and more to trigger a process of norm development, in which the law, companies and their stakeholders interact. This article provides an illustration of how mandatory disclosure, if it is restricted to a unilateral communication process, may produce no effective results (or even prove counterproductive), whilst highlighting the alternative potential of disclosure as an initiator of dialogue, supported by laws, geared towards the development and refinement of norms applicable to business in a global context and the values they promote. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Compliance; Disclosure; Globalization; Norms; Transparency",

It seems more appropriate to understand the firm as a human community, a concept which can be found in several sources, including managerial literature, business ethics scholars, and Catholic Social Teaching. In addition, there are also philosophical grounds that support the idea of business as a human community. Extending this concept, and drawing from some Phenomenological-Personalist philosophers, we propose that the firm should be seen as a particular ""community of persons"" oriented to providing goods and services efficiently and profitably. Being a ""community of persons"" emphasizes both individuals and the whole, and makes explicit the uniqueness, conscience, free will, dignity, and openness to human flourishing. This requires appropriate communication about and participation in matters which affect people's life, and makes it essential to cooperate for the common good of the business firm and the society. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aristotle; Business as a community; Business enterprise; Business ethos; Catholic Social Teaching; Corporation; Firm; Personalism",

We add to this growing stream of research by investigating how MNEs' social conduct in their emerging economy subsidiaries relates to their relationships with certain local stakeholders in the respective countries. Using stakeholder theory and the concept of local legitimacy, we argue that employees and the local governments are among the forces that drive firms to push for high standards in their working conditions and to engage in developing the local community. Further, we hypothesize that such efforts positively affect the performance of the subsidiary's employees and its relationship with local authorities. To test our hypotheses, we conduct a large-scale, cross-industry analysis using data from 213 MNE subsidiaries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that MNEs' local mid-level employees drive corporate social efforts and also positively react to the corporate social engagement of their employer. In contrast, local governments do not have a significant influence on MNEs' social strategies.

As an extension of those activities, the hinin fraternity also came to perform a range of official police duties under the authority of the City Magistrate's Office. While members of the hinin fraternity possessed specialized begging rights and official duties, those rights and duties existed inside a broader network of social relationships. Namely, members of the fraternity were only able to survive by begging because they maintained relationships with city neighborhoods and townspeople that provided alms. Similarly, members of the hinin fraternity were only able to perform official duties because they maintained a relationship with the magistrate's office, which ordered them to perform those duties, and with the individual neighborhoods that employed "" hinin watchmen.""

To examine the current state of business ethics in Israel, the study examines the following: (1) the extent of business ethics education in Israel; (2) the existence of formal corporate ethics program elements based on an annual survey of over 50 large Israeli corporations conducted over 5 years (2006-2010); and (3) perceptions of the state of business ethics based on interviews conducted with 22 senior Israeli corporate executives. In general, and particularly as a young country, Israel might be considered to have made great improvements in the state of business ethics over the years. In terms of business ethics education, the vast majority of universities and colleges offer at least an elective course in business ethics. In terms of formal business ethics program elements, many large companies now have a code of ethics, and over time continue to add additional elements. Most respondents believed they worked in ethical firms. Despite these developments, however, there appears to be significant room for improvement, particularly in terms of issues like: nepotism/favoritism; discrimination; confidentiality; treatment of customers; advertising; competitive intelligence; whistle-blowing; worker health and safety; and the protection of the environment. When compared with the U. S. or Europe, most believed that Israeli firms and their agents were not as ethical in business. A number of reasons were suggested that might be affecting the state of business ethics in Israel. A series of recommendations were also provided on how firms can better encourage an ethical corporate culture.

We identify four key assumptions in the decision making literature and illustrate how these assumptions affect decision making theory, research, and practice within the purview of business ethics. Given the breadth of disciplines and approaches within management decision making scholarship, a content analysis of management decision making scholarship produces a greater range of assumptions with finer granularity than similar scholarship within business ethics. By identifying the core assumptions within decision making scholarship, we start a conversation about why, how, and to what effect we make assumptions about decision making in business ethics theory, research, and practice.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper outlines the evolutionary process followed, and documents the practical insights gained and lessons learnt in relation to the concept of pro-poor foresight. Findings: Positive outcomes in the King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) foresight process included a high level of stakeholder engagement and senior management buy-in, supported by positive evaluations by diverse participants. The learning was subsequently incorporated into long-term development plans and proposals such as the ten-year development plan for the region. The experience yielded key lessons about the recruitment of participants, policy alignment, communication in diversity, active participation, facilitation as learning, the influence of technical inputs, and the importance of integration. Research limitations/implications: Further academic research could build upon this case study to investigate longer-term impacts of the initiative in KSD, tracking replications and adaptations of the KSD experiment, comparative research between contexts where foresight is used and where it is not in development policy and planning processes, enquiry into how foresight might be formally incorporated in the routine development policy and planning processes of municipalities, and undertaking more theoretical enquiry on the ""localising foresight"" concept and experience, including the development of guiding criteria and indicators for procedural and outcome success. Practical implications: The case focuses on learning in a developing world context where foresight is less advanced than in other contexts. The results of the exercise in KSD suggest that it is possible to embed pro-poor foresight in a large-scale policy programme to enhance the resilience of communities, supported by appropriate plans and budgets. Social implications: The long-term nature of foresight can create a ""safe"" platform for an otherwise difficult engagement, as is this case where three levels of government and various segments of civil society are to be beneficially engaged. Originality/value: This was a unique action research project in South Africa, where foresight has tended to be mainly at a top or central level - that being the level of corporate executives, national government, or national-level stakeholders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Development; Development planning; Forward planning; Local foresight; Local government; Multi-stakeholder foresight; Municipal strategic planning; Participatory planning; South Africa",

The article argues for a back-to-basics step of re-examining the complex roles companies play in conflict-affected societies and proposes a human security perspective to address gaps in the current conceptualisation of corporate responsibility and to develop policy which constrains and conscripts corporate power more effectively in fragile environments.

In this article we explore the relationships among various aspects of social embeddedness, social capital, and IS. We develop a conceptual framework and an approach using quantitative and qualitative methods to identify and measure these social characteristics, including social network structure, communication, and similarities in norms and conceptions of waste, and apply them in an industrial network in Nanjangud, South India. The findings suggest that there is a fairly high level of shared norms about dealing with waste-the ""short mental distance""-in this network, but by-product transactions are only weakly correlated with the structure and content of communication among managers.

Unfortunately, CSP has largely been employed as a way of demonstrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) in practice, or to justify the business case for CSR in academia by relating some measure of CSP to some measure of financial performance. In this article, we discuss multiple shortcomings to these approaches. We argue that (1) CSR activities need to be managed and measured as projects and aggregated to the business or corporate level using a project portfolio; (2) appropriate measures need to be identified that move away from reporting the firm's activities toward quantifying actual social outcomes achieved; and (3) given the types of projects prevalent in CSR, statistical evaluation methods common in other fields (ideally, pre-test post-test control group designs, such as used in medicine or propensity score matching for ongoing or past projects) should be employed to properly measure outcomes. We make a first, albeit imperfect, attempt at using such an approach with data collected on behalf of the Patrimonio Hoy project, a well-publicized CSR initiative carried out by Cemex in Mexico.

I argue that because freedom of association is a hypernorm, instrumental to fully realizing basic human rights, labor rights and human rights are largely inseparable. Thus, respect for labor rights is a non-substitutable requisite of corporate citizenship.

Silent complicity implies that corporations have moral obligations that reach beyond the negative realm of doing no harm. Essentially, it implies that corporations have a moral responsibility to help protect human rights by putting pressure on perpetrating host governments involved in human rights abuses. This is a controversial claim, which this contribution proposes to analyze with a view to understanding and determining the underlying conditions that need to be met in order for moral agents to be said to have such responsibilities in the category of the duty to protect human rights. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Corporate power; Corporate responsibility; Human rights; Multinational corporations; Silent complicity",

In Hume's analysis of these conventions, both philosophers and game theorists have correctly identified ""proto"" game-theoretic elements. One of the few attempts to offer a Humean theory of business ethics rests on this game-theoretic interpretation of Hume's argument. This article argues that game-theoretic reasoning is only one part of a Humean business ethics and this can be shown by further analyzing Hume's theory of justice. As we examine his theory, it becomes clear that Hume is not trying to show how it is always rational to respect the rules of business. Hume is not engaging in, or attempting, a reconciliation project and neither is a Humean business ethics.

In our article, we first sketch how Aquinas's theory can be also of relevance to a non-confessional audience through its appeal to the 'natural light of reason.'

The paper focuses on the following areas: ecosystem protection, stakeholder engagement, marine spatial planning and the provision of a network of highly protected marine reserves, and raises concerns that the ecosystem approach has progressively been dropped in the drafting process of the legislation. Concerns are raised that the new Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities have similar inherent conflicts of interest to those exhibited by Sea Fisheries Committees, which they sought to replace. The effectiveness of marine planning is questioned, as there appear to be inbuilt loopholes for public authorities to avoid complying with the marine plans. The draft marine policy statement (MPS), published in July 2010, includes appropriate environmental safeguards, but the MPS has not yet been formally adopted. The absence of a concrete target for highly protected marine reserves means there is a danger that designations under the Act may have little effect on the ground.

The purpose of this study is to assess whether Australian companies have adjusted their footprint-related disclosure responses. Adopting a legitimacy perspective, a key aim is to assess whether pragmatic or moral legitimation approaches dominate by determining whether disclosure tends to be more reflective of symbolism or of apparent behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of the sustainability and annual reports of the ASX's Top 50 companies is undertaken to compare carbon footprint-related disclosures in 2008 and 2005. Their extent and nature (action or symbolism) and the use of attention-attracting devices are reported for the more carbon intensive and less carbon intensive sectors. Findings: Footprint-related disclosure rates are increasing, and disclosure is being signalled more prominently. However, while carbon-intensive sectors appear to be pursuing a moral legitimation strategy underpinned by substantive action, the less intensive sectors are relying more heavily on symbolic disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small and comprises only large listed Australian companies. Practical implications: While the carbon-intensive sectors appear to be taking encouraging actions, a regulatory response may be required for the less carbon-intensive sectors to take advantage of their market power to facilitate cooperative carbon reduction with broader constituent groups. Further, incentives for the carbon-intensive sectors may be needed to encourage ongoing efforts to bridge the carbon chasm that is emerging. Originality/value: This study appears to be the first to provide direct Australian evidence on favoured legitimation tactics by assessing the symbolic versus behavioural management implicit in carbon footprint-related disclosures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Carbon intensity; Disclosure; Environmental disclosure; Legitimation",

Using quantitative data collected from a sample of 171 SMEs in the machinery and equipment sector of the Australian manufacturing industry, we find that all specified capabilities are positively associated with adoption of proactive CSR by SMEs, and that proactive CSR is, in turn, associated with an improvement in firm financial performance. Evidence of a fully mediating role for proactive CSR on the association between capabilities and financial performance presented in this study aligns with RBV theory that suggests adoption of value-creating strategies that make the most effective use of a firm's capabilities is essential to financial success.

Second, instrumental CSR adopted classical liberalism and libertarian laissez-faire as its structural logic.

Characterizing an MSI as consisting of numerous local networks that are embedded in a wider global network, I argue that tighter couplings (within local networks) and looser couplings (between local networks) coexist. Second, I suggest that this coexistence of couplings enables MSIs to generate policy outcomes which address the conditions of a transnational regulatory context.

Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI), defined as global institutions involving mainly corporations and civil society organizations, are one type of regulatory mechanism that tries to fill this gap by issuing soft law regulation. This conceptual paper examines the conditions of a legitimate transfer of regulatory power from traditional democratic nation-state processes to private regulatory schemes, such as MSIs. Democratic legitimacy is typically concerned with input legitimacy (rule credibility, or the extent to which the regulations are perceived as justified) and output legitimacy (rule effectiveness, or the extent to which the rules effectively solve the issues). In this study, we identify MSI input legitimacy criteria (inclusion, procedural fairness, consensual orientation, and transparency) and those of MSI output legitimacy (rule coverage, efficacy, and enforcement), and discuss their implications for MSI democratic legitimacy. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Corporate social responsibility; Deliberative democracy; Legitimacy; Multi-stakeholder initiative; Soft law",

Across three studies, effectiveness decreased negative perceptions and increased pro-organizational intentions via ethical judgment of the response. Moreover, the two dimensions interacted such that a response high in proximity but low in effectiveness led to more negative perceptions and to less pro-organizational intentions. This interaction was particularly pronounced if the corporation portrayed itself as communal-oriented. The interaction was mediated by individuals' ethical judgment, which was a function of the corporation's perceived benevolent concern. We termed the interaction the Strategic Samaritan, for it was when the corporation tried to appear like a Good Samaritan, displaying proximity with victims but not accompanying it with effective help, that it was seen as acting with less benevolent concern. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Corporate intentions; Corporate social responsibility; Crisis management; Disaster relief; Moral intensity",

Shareholder proposals, while under-theorized, provide a valuable lens through which to consider the argument that economic behaviour is embedded within social relations. In doing so, I situate my analysis within Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL) scholarship.

One group insists that Aquinas defined the just price as the payment needed to cover sellers' labor and material costs. A second camp vehemently counters that Aquinas's just price is simply the going market price. We argue that neither of these views is correct. The Thomistic just price is the price that would be agreed to by a just person as part of an exchange. This ""just person price"" takes into account the well-being of the individual transactors and the good of the entire community. Such a price reduces neither to the cost-covering price nor to the market exchange price.

This paper gives a partial answer by asking what legal rights corporations would need to have to fulfil various sorts of human rights obligations. We should compare the chances of human rights fulfilment (and violations) that are likely to result from assigning human rights obligations to corporations with the chances of human rights fulfilment (and violations) that are likely to result from giving corporations the legal rights needed to undertake those human rights obligations. Corporations should respect basic human rights of all people. Non-complicity in human rights violations requires that corporations have the right to political freedom of speech. To actively protect people from human rights violations, corporations need the right to hire armed security personnel; such obligations should be limited to protecting corporate property and narrowly defined stakeholders. Obligations to spend corporate resources on human rights fulfilment are confined to contributing to specific projects. Corporations have no obligation to ensure a society in which human rights are fulfilled.

The results showed that subjects in the shame condition donated less money (Experiment 1) and exhibited more self-interested choices in the modified decomposed game (Experiment 2). The desire for money as reflected in overestimated coin sizes mediated the effect of shame on self-interested behavior.

Following literature on the links between corporate social performance and financial performance, we attempt to validate if the relationship between environmental innovations and financial performance is not just unidirectional but likewise bi-directional. This comparative case study of Japanese automotive and electronics companies aims to: (1) determine if environmental innovations positively impact financial performance in prior years; (2) alternatively explore if financial performance in prior years positively impact environmental innovations; (3) establish if virtuous cycles exist in the relationships of variables; and (4) probe further if the directions, impacts or relationships hold consistently over a longitudinal period. Panel data regression analysis was performed for ten automotive and ten electronic companies listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, to determine the impact of the variables on each other for both directions from 2001 to 2009. Granger causality tests were performed to establish virtuous cycles. Finally, the same statistical techniques were employed on disaggregated data sets for the periods, 2001 to 2006 and 2004 to 2009, to capture any longitudinal differences. Our findings which point to the stark contrasts between the automotive and electronics companies, allow us to support earlier theorization and propose rival theories for results contrary to expectations. The automotive companies exemplify the resource-based view perspective as positive impacts of environmental innovations that are observed on revenues, profits, assets, long-term debt and equity, and vice-versa. However, these impacts seem to weaken over time. The electronics companies show only revenues and long-term debt as significantly controlled by environmental innovations and vice-versa.

On the financial theory of the firm, the responsibility for upholding ethical standards, forcing the internalization of costs, and so on, belong ultimately to government, not to corporate managers. The main argument for this position is that corporate managers have neither the right nor the ability to pursue multiple, nonfinancial goals.By contrast, stakeholder theory contends that the list of corporate constituencies includes all those who have a legitimate interest in the activities of a firm, regardless of any interest that the firm takes in them. Furthermore, the interests of these stakeholder groups merit consideration for their own sake, not because of their usefulness to the firm. Stakeholder theory has not been developed as a full-fledged alternative to the financial theory, and it is questionable whether it is necessarily incompatible with it. SWM is justified on the financial theory for its benefits to the whole of society, which includes all stakeholder groups. Corporate managers need not consider the interests of all stakeholders as long as these interests are adequately protected by some means, such as government regulation. In addition, managing a corporation with attention to stakeholder interests may be an effective means for maximizing shareholder value.

We characterize the inclusion of ethics in the accounting curriculum as 'pluri-disciplinary' following the typology of Davies and Devlin (2007) and draw on 22 interviews with accounting academics to examine curriculum change in a pluri-disciplinary context. We find that key staff concerns are the impact on broader accounting discourse, assignment of teaching responsibilities, curriculum content, and identification of who is ultimately responsible for the curriculum change. The responses indicate that staff would like to be equipped to confidently deliver ethics content and to have material relevant to a technically-focused student cohort. One means of achieving this might be to involve ethics experts in developing and delivering foundational material early in the curriculum and having accounting staff teach applications of this material in the latter stages. Our observations might also be of interest to those seeking to embed other 'soft' skills (such as communication, critical thinking and sustainability) within a technical curriculum.","Business ethics; Curriculum; Interdisciplinary; Pluri-disciplinary",

We argue that this public transcript of whistleblowing/silence overshadows the importance of continuing research into alternative (individual or collective) employee behaviour. Drawing on original research with a financial services organisation, our research uncovers a dissenting discourse that operates through implicit communication, such as codes, sarcasm and jokes.

A review of 190 academic papers spanning the period from 1975 to mid-2009 was conducted. This exploratory study evaluated the associations and disassociations of the primary name assigned to this genre of investment with variables grouped into five domains, namely Primary Ethical Position, Investment Strategy, Publication Date, Regions Covered and Periodical Type. The study indicated that papers coded as expressing a deontological ethical position were more frequently associated with the name Ethical Investment, whereas those with an ambiguous ethical position were less frequently associated with Ethical Investment. Three investment strategies (positive screening, best-in-class and cause-based investing) were unusually associated with the primary name Responsible Investment. A strong preference for the name Ethical Investment was noted in the United Kingdom, and contrasted starkly with an apparent aversion for this name in the United States. The name Ethical Investment is significantly more frequently used in journals dealing with ethics, business ethics and philosophy than in finance, economic and investment journals. Finally, the study yielded some weak hints that the name Responsible Investment might perhaps be linked to an egoist ethical position. On the basis of this, and because these have already been substantively linked through the Principles for Responsible Investment in the popular discourse, we follow the heuristic tradition set by Sparkes (Business Ethics Eur Rev 10:194-201, 2001), and propose that Responsible Investment be defined as 'Investment practices that integrate a consideration of ESG issues with the primary purpose of delivering higher-risk-adjusted financial returns'. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Egoism; Ethical investment; Naming; Responsible investment; Socially responsible investment",

Based on a sample of 124 S&P 500 firms, the authors found that it is a firm's visibility to stakeholders, rather than its economic performance, that has the larger impact on managers' decisions regarding how much CSP their firms exhibit. The results show that more profitable firms may not be motivated to engage actively in CSP unless they are under greater scrutiny by various firm stakeholders.

Most studies have tried to test, largely in samples of multiple industries, the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). These analyses, however, have produced conflicting results and any attempt to give a generalized and coherent conclusion has proved inadequate. This article examines the ways CSP can be proxied and investigates the possible relationship between CSP (measured by ethical rating) and CFP (measured by market and accounting ratios) in the banking sector using correlation methodology. It emerges that there is no statistically significant link between CSP and CFP. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Banking sector; Corporate financial performance; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Correlation",

For, though such businesses violate human rights they have been largely ignored by business ethicists. It is time to surmount this indifference in view of recent international efforts to define illicit businesses for regulatory purposes. Standing in the way, however, is a meta-ethical question as to whether any business can be declared unqualifiedly immoral. In support of an affirmative answer I address a number of counter-indications by comparing approaches to organized crime and to corporate crime, comparing the ethical critique of businesses studied in business ethics and those socially banned, and comparing the business ethics assumption as to businesses' ethicality to societal ethical neutrality regarding war-related businesses. My conclusion: to help advance respect for human rights, business ethicists should apply their expertise to the task of defining illicit businesses. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate crime; corporate social responsibility; human rights; illicit business; international law; organized crime; UNGC",

The extent to which these efforts, in addition to informing about the company stance on ethics, are able to positively influence behavior is disputed. In contrast, research on business ethics communication and behavior indicates a relatively clear, positive link between open workplace dialogue about ethical issues and ethical conduct. In this article, I therefore address the question: What influences employee attitudes to talking openly about ethical issues? Answers are proposed on the basis of focus group interviews with staff at the Denmark and Brazil affiliates of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk. It was found that interest in discussing ethical issues was influenced by two main factors: employee conceptualizations of business ethics and the level of inter-collegial trust, credibility, and confidence. In this article, by examining these phenomena, I aim at providing insight that can both inform scholars in these fields as well as help managers in their attempts to promote open workplace dialogue about ethical issues. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","communication; dialogue; ethical decision-making; ethics program; moral awareness; organizational behavior; trust",

Indeed, they in some ways promote the mobilisation of accounting in the context.

In an attempt to begin to explore the extent to which, if any, the language of human rights has entered the discourse of corporate accountability, this paper investigates the adoption of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) human rights standards by major multinational garment retail companies that source products from developing countries, as disclosed through their reporting media. The paper has three objectives. Firstly, to empirically explore the extent to which a group of multinational garment retailers invoke the language of human rights when disclosing their corporate responsibilities. The paper reviews corporate reporting media including social responsibility codes of conduct, annual reports and stand-alone social responsibility reports released by 18 major global clothing and retail companies during a period from 1990 to 2007. We find that the number of companies adopting and disclosing on the ILO's workplace human rights standards has significantly increased since 1998 - the year in which the ILO's standards were endorsed and accepted by the global community (ILO, 1998). Secondly, drawing on a combination of Responsive Regulation theory and neo-institutional theory, we tentatively seek to understand the regulatory space that may have influenced these large corporations to adopt the language of human rights obligations. In particular, we study the role that International Governmental Organisation's (IGO) such as ILO may have played in these disclosures. Finally, we provide some critical reflections on the power and potential within the corporate adoption of the language of human rights. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Human rights; Institutional theory; International Governmental Organisation; International Labour Organisation; Multinational companies; Responsive regulation",

Furthermore, the probability increment brought by management affiliations for non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) is greater than that for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These results suggest that state ownership and management affiliations are two important types of connection that impair auditor independence, and that management affiliations are of greater importance to private-sector firms than to SOEs. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","auditor independence; business ethics; China; corporate governance; guanxi; state ownership",

Previous studies have focused on implications of guanxi for business outcomes; few have examined guanxi development, which is the purpose of this study. Two theoretical modes of dynamic guanxi processes in the workplace are proposed: working guanxi and backdoor guanxi. The two modes differ in frequency of interaction, frequency of exchange of favors, and how clear the parties are on what each stands to gain from a particular interaction. Although face is expected to play a role in the development of each, the type of face that is most important differs. For working guanxi, lian (personal character) is most important. For backdoor guanxi, mianzi (status) is most important. Backdoor guanxi is the mode most likely to be associated with corruption, bribery, and client-patron relations.

This study examined newspaper editorials, letters to the editor, op-ed columns, news analyses, and guest columns for three aspects: media attention, media prominence, and media valence. Results showed an increase in the number of opinion pieces covering CSR issues over the 25-year period. The prominence of each of the four CSR dimensions varied over time. Each of the four CSR dimensions had its moment of media prominence when it was more important than the other dimensions. The most prevalent valence of the opinion pieces was negative; the volume of negative pieces increased over the 25 years, whereas the number of opinions with positive, neutral, and mixed tones showed little change over time.

The paper aims to obtain empirical evidence regarding the importance of relational aspects (trust) vis-à-vis organisational ones (reliance) for building long-term business relationships. Design/methodology/approach: This is an exploratory study to examine trust and reliance in the manufacturing and construction industries of four countries: UK, India, Pakistan, and Poland. Statistical analysis is based on a data sample of 501 responses collected through a survey of buying and selling relationships. Findings: Although varying across countries, stable relationships with high levels of both trust and reliance exist widely in business markets. Exclusively trust-based business relationships, i.e. those which are mainly driven by individual-level aspects, are very rare. However, both trust and reliance are significant for building relationships with long-term perspectives. Practical implications: Managers in firms who want to build advantageous and sustainable business relationships need to be able to discern the difference between trust in people on the one hand, and reliance on the partner firms on the other. This research shows that to maintain sustainable relationships, firms should not only focus their relational capabilities on enhancing reliance aspects with their business partners, but also aim to build good levels of trust in the interaction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business relationships; International business; Reliance; Trust",

The study follows Bushee (Account Rev 73(3):305-333, 1998) in categorising institutions as dedicated or transient. The demand for shares is organised according to three factors: a long-term factor, corporate responsibility; a short-term factor, market liquidity; and a time-independent factor, portfolio theory. The rank and importance of the factors for the different types of institutional investor are analysed. For one of two types of dedicated institution, corporate responsibility is as important as portfolio theory in influencing the demand for shares. For all dedicated institutions, corporate responsibility influences the demand for shares more than market liquidity. For two of the three types of transient institution, market liquidity is the most important factor in share selection. For all transient institutions, the least important factor is corporate responsibility. Findings suggest that corporate responsibility positively and significantly influences the demand for shares by dedicated institutions. The discussion considers the extent to which these trends are constitutive of significant shifts in ethicality within the context of institutional investment. Looking at this from within a highly institutionalised Anglo market model, dedicated institutions' commitment to broader and longer-term concerns could be interpreted as a small but significant step towards a more axiologically informed ethical business practice. Such a form of engagement calls for sensitive attention to a fuller range of features deemed to be relevant to investment decisions, as opposed to more narrow reliance on legislation, codes of practice and fiduciary principles. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; corporate responsibility; institutional investment; share ownership",

De facto corporate citizenship represents responsibility for social action and action in the local community, which reflects on the reputation and business results in a long-term time perspective, thus providing an additional impetus for further activities. The fundamental postulate of stewardship theory is that managers always act in such a way to maximize the interests of a company and contemporary business environment is forcing management towards ethically responsible, innovative, but profitable businesses. Therefore, the strategic role of managerial stewardship behaviour is hypothesised as support for the realization of corporate citizenship.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses different levels on which business affects the natural environment. Individual biological creatures are affected by business via hunting, fishing, agriculture, animal testing, etc. Natural ecosystems are affected by business via mining, regulating rivers, building, polluting the air, water and land, etc. The Earth as a whole is affected by business via exterminating species, contributing to climate change, etc. Findings: Business has a natural, non-reciprocal responsibility toward natural beings affected by its functioning. At the level of individual biological creatures, awareness-based ethics is adequate for business. At the level of natural ecosystems, ecosystem ethics is relevant for business. At the level of the Earth as a whole, Gaian ethics applies to business. Practical implications: A business activity system can be considered acceptable if: its aggregate impact on animal welfare is non-negative;, its aggregate impact on ecosystem health is non-negative; and its aggregate impact on the living planet is non-negative. By satisfying the above criteria, business can performs its duty: not to harm nature or allow others to come to harm.

This study examines the determinants of the initial start-up financing of entrepreneurial firms in 27 countries. There are information asymmetries and moral hazard problems inherent in the funding of an initial start-up firm. Empirical results show that institutional investors rely on the experience of entrepreneurs in managing start-ups and the quality of investor protection to reduce moral hazard. On the other hand, informal investors are also common in initial start-up funding. They tend to be attracted to the type of products in the new firm. In comparison, informal investors are likely to have a social relationship with the entrepreneur, and thus have information about that person's skill and character, which renders entrepreneurial experience less important. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Connectedness; Early stage financing; Entrepreneurial finance; External financing; Legal environment; Social relationships; Start-up",

However, in the collective living arrangement, reaching a consensus with regard to the residential environment is difficult. The purpose of this paper is to identify factors that can reduce the conflict among the stakeholders in multi-owner low-cost housing in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study tested three hypotheses examining whether the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of owner-occupants and occupancy rates affect owner-occupants' satisfaction with stakeholders' relationships. Data were collected through questionnaires from owner-occupants of multi-owner low-cost settlements in Selangor state. Data on housing characteristics were collected from chairpersons of the respective owners' organisations. The data were treated as parametric, and analysis of variance was conducted. Findings: Four factors - number of children in the family, duration of residency, participation in social activities and participation in meetings - were found to affect owners-occupants' satisfaction with the stakeholders' relationships. The significant effect of occupancy rates was also indicated. Practical implications: The Management Corporations (MCs) should encourage social relationships among residents. To avoid conflict, the costs and benefits of participation must be balanced. Policy makers should take two key aspects seriously: owner-managed strategy practices by the MCs and high rates of tenant-residents. A mechanism should be identified for assisting the MCs in housing management and for protecting the benefits of homeownership for owner-occupants.

Some ST firms voluntarily pay substantial fees to their external auditors to conduct interim audits, which are not required by regulations.

As a result, these firms are more likely to return to profitability and reduce their delisting risk.

Thus it is proposed that utilization of solitude positively predicts executive-level authentic ethical leadership action and in turn, ethical decision making perceived fairness and integrity.

It is in the notion of moral free space that this pluralism is most clearly expressed. This oversight is unfortunate for two reasons. Firstly, it prevents the potential of ISCT, as a normative theory of business ethics, from being appreciated fully; secondly, it leads us to ignore resources that could help tackle its most problematic flaws.

The reference point is Colombiás 1991 Constitution and the position is that the liberal model of enterprise does not satisfy the principles and norms of a social state of law.

To see fully what demands justice makes on the workplace, we should first spell out the implications that domestic justice has for working conditions. When this is done, we can develop a conception of workplace justice and investigate what content such local justice should have. John Rawls's political liberalism was constructed for the specific problem of a just basic structure; in order to apply it to another problem the key theoretical concepts must be revised.

In this sense, it is important to know exactly how this form is different to understand how conceptions of 'corporate governance' relate to different forms of representation. Second, it is my contention that the use of a particular understanding of incorporation directly informs the concept of internal governance in terms of constituency, structure, ownership and the locus of corporate agency. It is in this sense that I argue that the identification of corporate constituencies and the allocation of agency and ownership is a precondition of business ethics. With this aim in mind, I explore the governance in corporations as the result of the legal understanding of incorporation and the separate legal entity. I explore two historical positions from which five legal positions on the separate legal entity can be derived. These five positions provide reference points for the attribution of ownership and agency between the separate legal entity and the aggregation of individuals that together make up the corporation. Incorporation, as the legal act that constitutes the corporation, can then be shown to adopt multiple and mutually exclusive positions. These positions are central to the debate on the respective claims to agency and ownership between the separate legal entity and the aggregation of individuals. I then end the article by arguing that all concepts of incorporation create legal and economic issues regarding the allocation of ownership and agency, which makes their understanding and the choice behind them important for theories of governance. © 2011 The Author.",,

The paper aims to obtain empirical evidence regarding the importance of relational aspects (trust) vis-à-vis organisational ones (reliance) for building long-term business relationships. Design/methodology/approach: This is an exploratory study to examine trust and reliance in the manufacturing and construction industries of four countries: UK, India, Pakistan, and Poland. Statistical analysis is based on a data sample of 501 responses collected through a survey of buying and selling relationships. Findings: Although varying across countries, stable relationships with high levels of both trust and reliance exist widely in business markets. Exclusively trust-based business relationships, i.e. those which are mainly driven by individual-level aspects, are very rare. However, both trust and reliance are significant for building relationships with long-term perspectives. Practical implications: Managers in firms who want to build advantageous and sustainable business relationships need to be able to discern the difference between trust in people on the one hand, and reliance on the partner firms on the other. This research shows that to maintain sustainable relationships, firms should not only focus their relational capabilities on enhancing reliance aspects with their business partners, but also aim to build good levels of trust in the interaction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business relationships; International business; Reliance; Trust",

In this paper, we aim to address this gap by critically engaging with marketing campaigns of so-called 'ethical' bottled water. We especially focus on a major CSR strategy of a range of different companies that promise to provide drinking water for (what they name as) 'poor African people' by way of Western consumers purchasing bottled water. Following Fairclough's approach, we unfold a three-step critical discourse analysis of the marketing campaigns of 10 such 'ethical' brands. Our results show that bottled water companies try to influence consumers' tastes through the management of the cultural meaning of bottled water, producing a more 'ethical' and 'socially responsible' perception of their products/ brands. Theoretically, we base our analysis on McCracken's model of the cultural meaning of consumer goods, which, we argue, offers a critical perspective of the recent emergence of CSR and business ethics initiatives. We discuss how these marketing campaigns can be framed as historical struggles associated with neo-liberal ideology and hegemony. Our analysis demonstrates how such CSR strategies are part of a general process of the reproduction of capitalist modes of accumulation and legitimation through the usage of cultural categories. © 2011 The Author.",,

Previous consumer research has tended to focus on goods and services within daydreams and fantasies so that goods seem to be central to, and key resources in, the construction of imagined scenarios. Here we argue that this methodological framing has restricted a broader understanding of the imagination and the contextualization of consumption within it. By analysing phenomenological accounts that placed imagining ahead of consumption as the focus of the study, we found that individuals readily envisioned common cultural desires for successful relationships, happiness and love in positive imagined futures, where goods may be merely assumed as part of the background, or dismissed in favour of preferred emotional experiences. As such this article uses Law's (2004) conceptions of presence, manifest absence and othering to provide a more nuanced analysis of how and where consumption may be seen in the imagination. In this way we suggest that previous narratives of the consumer imagination have neglected individuals' autonomy in both removing consumer practices and positioning social relationships as more prominent. © 2011 The Author(s).","daydream; escape; everyday life; future imagining; othering; relationships",

Business ethics pays close attention to the international character of business. The key question is whether or not there is any common set of values shared by all people of all cultural and historical backgrounds. Western multinationals are in practice unable to prevent shoddy labour practices in their overseas factories. The discrepancy between ""the-what-is"" and ""the-what-should-be"" is probably the main problem in the field of ethics. With this in mind, we have been teaching Business Ethics at the Faculty of Informatics and Management for more than 10 years. The method of teaching which proves to be the most suitable is based on studying and discussing case studies. Students are taught how to approach these problems and that the pursuit of profit should always be ethical. Teaching ethics at FIM UHK is based on basic anthropina, i.e. basic human characteristics, which differentiate humans from other living creatures, as well as on the European philosophical tradition and also on pre-philosophical, non-philosophical as well as non-European philosophical foundations of ethics. We ground our course in traditional ethical concepts and problems (e.g. the origin, essence and function of morality, relations between morality and law, reason and emotion in decision-making and acting, individualism and universalism, subjectivism and objectivism as well as transversalism) and concentrate on the discussed problems of contemporary ethics - mainly business ethics. We respect multi-level ethical analysis covering the universal - global dimension, the dimension of socio-cultural changes in current heterogeneous societies, professional and institutional dimension as well as company codes of conduct, and the dimension of individual morality.","Business; Education; Enterprise; Ethics; Manager",

With a sample of 80 different Australia-based firms, we have examined various parameters attributing to corporate sustainability and have arrived at three kinds of performance outcomes (factors) that concur with triple bottom line principles, which we term as: 1 corporate environmental performance outcome (CEPO) 2 corporate social performance outcome (CSPO) 3 corporate financial performance outcome (CFPO). The results of the ANOVA analysis of these factors against business size have been discussed and the significantly higher CEPO in large size businesses than in small or medium size businesses have been explored.

We argue that cooperative union-NGO relationships are difficult to form in part because of the differences existing between how unions and NGOs organize.

Furthermore, we offer a discussion on the characteristics of different approaches to incorporating CSR as part of business strategy and provide examples from the Norwegian context. As part of this discussion, we look into some of the clusters in Europe which have adopted a systematic approach to implement CSR as part of their agenda. We propose a means to undertake CSR as part of the cluster through a network model to address the limitations faced by the SMEs when they try to implement CSR individually. A network model (cluster approach) to CSR will motivate the uptake of CSR among SMEs when the network (cluster) is characterized by close geographical proximity and operates in the same sector. The uptake of CSR as part of the network (cluster) agenda can also lead to innovation through cooperation and competition.

The need for effective and ongoing community engagement (CE) has been highlighted by this ongoing contention and the ensuing desire for plantation management companies to maintain a social licence to operate. CE activities are required under various regulations governing forest management practices within Australia. In recent years, voluntary governance mechanisms, particularly forest certification, have further promoted stakeholder engagement as an integral component of modern forest management. This paper reviews the influence of the introduction of forest certification on CE practice in the field. The effectiveness of operationally-based CE activities conducted within Australian plantation management was examined through a qualitative study of plantation managers and community members in conjunction with a document analysis of relevant regulations, codes of forest practices and forest certification standards. Whilst arguing that forest certification is positively impacting on CE practice, the research indicates that a number of regulatory, corporate and social influences impact on the capacity of forest certification to promote positive changes in CE practice. The impact of forest certification is limited by existing CE requirements within both mandatory and voluntary regulations; the narrow commercially-oriented foci promoted by corporate realities and organisational ethos; poor practitioner skills and understanding of fundamental CE concepts; and the presence of pre-existing negative perceptions of firms or individuals. Regardless of these limiting influences, our research has shown that forest certification is positively affecting engagement practices within operational plantation management. Such improvements are infrequently acknowledged as they are typically not obvious in terms of changes in CE techniques or improved social relations. Instead, we suggest that forest certification is promoting a longer term, cumulative change in CE practice. The capacities of plantation managers and communities to effectively engage with each other are improving due to the forest certification requirement for continual improvement that results in plantation managers continually reflecting on engagement outcomes and adapting practices based on prior learnings. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental management; Environmental regulation; Forest regulation; Natural resource management; Public participation; Social issues; Triple bottom line","Forest regulation; Natural resource management; Public participation; Social issues; Triple Bottom Line; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Management; Managers; Natural resources management; Forestry; Australia; Certification; Forest Management; Forestry; Natural Resources; Plantations; Qualitative Analysis"

Ethics Position Theory (EPT) maintains that individuals' personal moral philosophies influence their ethical judgments, actions, and emotions. The theory, when describing individual differences in moral philosophies, stresses two dimensions: relativism (skepticism with regards to inviolate moral principles) and idealism (concern for positive outcomes). Extending previous research that identified differences in relativism and idealism between residents of different countries and world regions, we examined the relationship between relativism, idealism, and the regulatory standards governing commercial activities of firms headquartered in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. The results indicated that the level of relativism of a nation's populace predicted degree of ethical codification of commerce in that nation.

Existing theories, addressing the corporate level of analysis, focus on forces exogenous to the firm: local resource pressures, and institutional norms. Using a combination of induction and fuzzy-set analysis, I draw on documentary evidence and 298 interviews with managers and stakeholders to build theory about the conditions that shape subsidiaries' stakeholder orientations. Two major findings emerge. First, although theory emphasizes external stakeholders' control over resources, internal control through the corporate parent can crowd out the voices of local stakeholders. Second, although institutional theory proposes isomorphism with local norms and standards, some corporations are subject to scrutiny by global stakeholders, and their subsidiaries face higher requirements for social engagement than their peers. These findings are the foundation of a mid-range theory that combines conventional explanations, focused on environmental factors, and an internal-stakeholder perspective, based around the roles of the parent corporation as owner and resource provider, to predict stakeholder orientation. © 2011 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.","corporate social responsibility; fuzzy set methods; global stakeholders",

Previous literature, maintaining the need for a marketing approach to festivals, identifies the need for maintaining strong stakeholder relationships in order to succeed in a business environment; attention has been focused to the theory of relationship marketing (RM) because of the recognition that this practice is complementary to the marketing of festivals. The very nature of the music festival as an annual, usually, 4-day event means that effective marketing is needed to keep connections with the consumer throughout the year. This article focuses on the RM techniques utilised within the music festival industry from the viewpoint of the festival organiser in an attempt to establish how festival organisations value and monitor organisational relationships. This article explores the extent to which these relationships are valued and managed; furthermore, the variations between these intricate relationships are considered by focusing on those held with the organisation's consumers and sponsors, the results of which have provided the ability to establish the importance and relevance of RM to the industry and further identify the marketing communication methods employed to establish and maintain such relationships. In-depth, convergent interviews have been conducted with a segment of music festival organisers from a range of events. The results have been integrated with the study of current literature to best exemplify these issues.

Major ethical dilemmas at Enron, Worldcom, AIG, as well as other well-known organizations have been at least partially blamed on CEO malfeasance. Interviews with Ken Lay, CEO of Enron, after his 2006 fraud convictions provides an opportunity to document his perceived role in the demise of Enron. Possibly no other CEO has had as much impact on the scrutiny and legalization of business ethics as Ken Lay. This analysis is timely because of many information sources now available and the recent Supreme Court decisions on Enron conviction appeals.

It explores this engagement as governing practices that have emanated quite independently from the interstate system commonly understood to be at the core of the anti-corruption regime. It demonstrates how corporate anti-corruption ties in with a relatively new way of perceiving corruption. In this framing, anti-corruption comes out as risk management, which is latched on to notions of corporate social responsibility and business ethics. Moreover, the constitution of corruption risk relates to the rise of new actors and networks engaged in a wider business of anti-corruption, including commercial and hybrid actors that supply corporations with managerial instruments, benchmarks for best practice, rankings, and information and surveillance systems. This facilitates the enrollment of corporations into the anti-corruption cause while cultivating their competitiveness aspirations. The article offers a novel perspective on international anti-corruption and the position of business herein, and in a wider sense, it also contributes discussions about the role of private actors and their micro practices in global governance. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Corporations; Corruption; Governmentality; International anti-corruption; Risk management",

We argue that CSP activity can be explained by the firm's identity orientation toward stakeholders (Brickson, Admin Sci Quart 50:576, 2005; Acad Manage Rev 32:864, 2007). Specifically, individualistic, relational, or collectivistic identity orientations can describe a firm's level of CSP activity toward certain stakeholders. Family firms, we suggest, adopt a more relational orientation toward their stakeholders than nonfamily firms, and thus engage in higher levels of CSP. Further, we invoke collectivistic identity orientation to argue that the higher the level of family or founder involvement within a family firm, the greater the level of CSP toward specific stakeholders. Using social performance rating data from 1991 to 2005, we find that family and nonfamily firms demonstrate notable differences in terms of social initiatives and social concerns. We also find that the level of family and founder involvement is related to the type and frequency of a family firm's social initiatives and social concerns. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate social performance; family firms; stakeholder theory",

One of the key criteria of poverty is vulnerability even to minor events. In such cases, even micro coverage can make a major difference, yet still be funded by an affordable contribution by the insured. Like any kind of insurance, microinsurance can cover different risks to life, health, farming, property among other things. Our paper sketches how one could address and develop microinsurance business ethics. First, we introduce microinsurance to the business ethics community and business ethics to the microinsurance community. Our draft of microinsurance ethics is then developed from two angles: as a holistic understanding of ideals and possible ethical conflicts in key stakeholder relationships and by distinguishing eight challenges when targeting the poor and when marketing microinsurance. As an open ending, the article suggests a three-stage action research design focusing on how microinsurance could (and should) internalize ethics, respecting rather than neglecting national- and local-cultural conditions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Developing countries; Insurance; Microinsurance",

The effectiveness of these codes has been widely discussed on theoretical grounds and empirically tested in numerous previous reports that directly compare companies with and without codes of conduct. Empirical research has yielded inconsistent results that may be explained by multiple ancillary factors, including the quality of code content and implementation, which are excluded from analyses based solely on the presence or absence of codes. This study investigated the importance of code content in determining code effectiveness by examining the relationship between code of conduct quality and ethical performance. Companies maintaining high quality codes of conduct were significantly more represented among top CSR ranking systems for corporate citizenship, sustainability, ethical behavior, and public perception. Further, a significant relationship was observed between code quality and CSR performance, across a full range of ethical rankings. These findings suggest code quality may play a crucial role in the effectiveness of codes of conduct and their ability to transform organizational cultures. Future research efforts should transcend traditional comparisons based on the presence or absence of ethical codes and begin to examine the essential factors leading to the effective establishment of CSR policies and sustainable business practices in corporate culture. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","code content; code quality; codes of conduct; codes of ethics; CSR ranking system; ethical performance",

Each one of these refers to a different form of legitimacy and is based on distinct theories of the firm analyzed in this article. We claim that dialectic rhetoric seems to signal a new understanding of the firm's role in society and a search for moral legitimation. However, this new form of rhetoric is still fairly uncommon although its use is growing. Combining theory and business examples, this article may help managers and researchers in the conceptualization of how firms make sense of their role in society and what forms of differentiation they strive for through their rhetoric strategies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business and society; business ethics; Corporate Social Responsibility; discourse analysis; globalization; organizational legitimacy; rhetoric",

The degree of privatization and globalization is varied across countries since each of them is in a different phase of transition.

Business Ethics courses tend to focus on functional ethics, managerial ethics and implementing codes of ethical conduct. Across the 12 countries, Business Ethics is taught either as an elective or a core course in most institutions. Training emphasis across countries is varied. While training institutions in India appear to be high, the presence of multinational consultants in Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is significant.

The investigation done shows that, in general terms, LA is not much developed in the BE field. Analysing the most important findings it is possible to conclude that more topics are being studied and that activities are growing in the field of BE in LA. However, it is also clear that the field of BE remains clearly underdeveloped in the region. BE is addressed by only a few business schools in each country and a small number of NGOs in LA. In addition, until now little rigorous research has been conducted and publications in prestigious academic journals have been scarce. Studies in BE are still relatively rare and very locally focussed. From another perspective, there is a great difference in the level of activity across countries in the LA region. When looking at the future, corruption appears as the major concern, almost certainly due to the political, social, and ethical context that many of the nations in the region are experiencing.

It has since expanded dramatically in numbers as well as diversified into many different domains. We find this rich diversity in the conception of business ethics back in the answers of our respondents to every single question. The concepts they propose, the courses they teach, the subjects under research as well as the training and consultancy offered to clients and even the challenges for the future all reflect this diversity. Decisive for the expansion of business ethics in Europe has been the advance of CSR and the official backing of CSR by the European Commission. We further argue that the prevalence and importance of business ethics and CSR differs throughout Europe.

One tendency noted in the literature is that CR communication is organised and structured. Corporations tend to professionalise CR communication in the sense that they provide information that corresponds to demands for transparency that are voiced by certain stakeholders. This also means that experts within the firm tend to communicate with professional stakeholders outside the firm. In this article, a particular aspect of the organisation of CR communication is examined, a phenomenon that we refer to as the 'filtration effect'. By comparing CR communication in parent companies and their subsidiaries, we show empirically that there is considerably less CR communication on the subsidiary level compared to the parent level. We see filtration as a sign of conscious organising of CR communication that implies particular attention to certain stakeholder groups with clearly defined demands and expectations on companies. The strong filtration effect noted in the study suggests that CR communication does not seem to be very much adapted to customers, which may be problematic both from a communicative and ethical perspective.

This two-in-one chain comprised a forward and backward chain for the automobile industry. Consequently, 10 measures with 49 metrics and 6 measures with 23 metrics were identified and developed for the forward and backward chains, respectively. Sequel to the development of these measures, a survey was conducted using a four-page questionnaire distributed to experts (including academics and practitioners) to establish their importance and applicability. The findings of this study suggested that the importance and applicability of all the developed measures have been substantiated. For the forward chain, the most crucial measure was customer perspective while the most applicable one was traditional supply chain cost. The reverse chain measures were topped by management commitment in terms of both importance and applicability. This study contributed to the advancement of knowledge by pioneering the development of a set of holistic measures for evaluating the performance of the automobile green supply chain. The study was wrapped up with the proposition of directions for further studies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

On one hand, within insurance practices 'risk' is always defined in technical terms. It is related to monetary measurement of value and to statistical probability calculated for a limited population. On the other hand, and at the same time, insurance has an inherent connection to solidarity. When taking out an insurance, one participates in the risk pool within which each member is reciprocally responsible for others' risks. The combination of technical controllability and solidarity has made insurance a successful tool for governing welfare societies during the twentieth century. From the point of view of business ethics, it is interesting that, as we argue in this article, the connection between insurance and solidarity is not limited to social welfare assemblages, but is evident in relation to private insurance as well. At the same time, however, it is important to understand that insurance does not advance all forms of solidarity. Hence, this theoretical article analyzes the specific conceptions of solidarity that the different forms of insurance practice produce. Particular emphasis is put on the distinction between 'chance solidarity' and 'subsidizing solidarity'. The main questions of the article are: What kinds of conceptions of solidarity are built in the insurance technology? And how are the limits of solidarity defined and justified in different forms of insurance? © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chance solidarity; Insurance; Life insurance; Risk; Risk technologies; Solidarity; Subsidizing solidarity; Welfare",

This article examines the curious fact that most business ethics scholars use concepts, principles, and normative methods for identifying and justifying these beyond-compliance obligations that are very different from the ones that are used to set the levels of regulations themselves. Its modest proposal-a plea for a research agenda, really-is that we could reduce this normative asymmetry by borrowing from the normative framework of ""regulation"" to identify and justify an important range of beyond-compliance obligations. In short, we might think of ""self-regulation"" as a language and a normative framework with some distinct advantages over other frameworks like stakeholder theory, corporate social responsibility, corporate citizenship, and the like. These other frameworks have been under attack in the business ethics literature of late, primarily for their vagueness and their disappointing inability to distinguish clearly between genuine beyond-compliance moral obligations, on the one hand, and charitable acts that are laudable but not morally obligatory, on the other. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Beyond-compliance obligations; Business ethics; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Market failure; Regulation; Self-regulation; Stakeholder theory",

Taking as our starting point Levinas' demanding view of responsibility as 'following the assignation of responsibility for my neighbour', we use a case study of a packaging company-PackCo-to argue that a concern with being seen and/or seeing oneself as responsible should not be confused with actual responsibility. Our analysis of the case points first to the allure of programmes of strategic corporate responsibility and the ways in which, through identification, they can provide a tacit form of moral sanction to managers in their aggressive pursuit of profit. It then contrasts the responses of different managers to negative staff feedback to illustrate the difference between managers' attempts to defend their identity of being 'responsible' managers, and responsible conduct itself. The paper concludes that a potent danger of programmes of corporate responsibility is that they allow managers to deceive not just others, but also themselves in relation to the exercise of responsibility. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate responsibility; Ethical identity; Ethics; Levinas",

In this paper, I examine Hansmann's own argument in support of this view, in order to draw out its implications for some of the traditional concerns of business ethicists about corporate social responsibility. The centerpiece of Hansmann's argument is the claim that ownership of the firm is most naturally exercised by the group able to achieve the lowest agency costs, and that homogeneity of interest within the ownership group is the most important factor in achieving lower costs. He defends this claim through a study of cooperatives, attempting to show that homogeneity is the source of the competitive advantage most often enjoyed by shareholders over other constituency groups, such as workers, suppliers and customers, when it comes to exercising control over the firm. Some business ethicists, impressed by this argument, have taken it to be a vindication of Milton Friedman's claim that profit-maximization is the only ""social responsibility"" of management. I would like to suggest that this conclusion does not follow, and that the ""Hansmann argument"" lends itself to a less minimalist view, what I refer to as a ""market failures"" approach to business ethics. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cooperatives; Efficiency; Henry Hansmann; Ownership; Shareholder primacy",

While the primacy (descriptive or prescriptive) of shareholders is argued for in various ways, others seek to promote a wider stakeholder model of the firm and its governance. In both cases, the interests of creditors tend to be neglected. In this paper, the fundamental position of creditors in a system of corporate law that offers limited liability is reasserted and explained, and the implications explored. It is demonstrated that there are, in effect, two modes of governance possible for a limited liability corporation: the ""normal"" mode, when shareholders' interests are primary, and the ""distressed"" mode, when creditors' interests are paramount. As a result of this analysis, writers on corporate governance who are influenced by certain managerial myths or economic theories of the firm are encouraged to view the position of shareholders in a more informed light. Writers on business ethics, who often find themselves contending, perhaps implicitly, with inappropriate understandings of the nature of business corporations and their governance, are similarly alerted to the weakness of certain positions perceived as antithetical to their agenda. Finally, business ethicists who advocate a stakeholder perspective are encouraged to recognize the position of creditors and to pay more attention to them as a stakeholder group. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bankruptcy; Company law; Corporate governance; Creditors; Governance; Limited liability; Shareholder primacy; Stakeholder theory; Suppliers; Trade creditors",

We suggest that the existing governance structures are based on an outdated paradigm of business, rooted in economics. We propose an alternative paradigm, a more humanistic paradigm, which allows conceiving alternative, network-oriented governance structures. As hierarchical firms grow larger and more complex, the risk of failure increases from biases, errors, and missing data in communication and control systems. These problems are exacerbated by information overload on senior managers, directors, and their respective regulators. In contrast to traditional corporate governance, network governance introduces a division of power via multiple boards, checks and balances, and active stakeholder engagement. We argue that those features could have prevented the stresses and failures of financial firms in 2008, since they were anticipated by both individuals within firms and external commentators.

Many scholars believe that only humans can be moral agents, and therefore business needs to create models that foster greater receptivity to others through ethical dialog. This view leads to a difficulty if no specific person is the sole causal agent for an act, or if something comes about through aggregated action in a corporate setting. An alternate approach suggests that corporations are moral agents sufficiently like humans to be treated as persons, which leads to questions of intentionality and the organizational structure required to support the claim. In this article, I make an intermediate claim combining Goodpaster and Matthews' (60:132-141, 1982) view that a corporation may have a moral culture which affects subjective choices, with those of Painter-Morland (17(3):515-534, 2007) who points out that we should move from a model that posits discrete persons acting on each other to one where morality comes about through shared experience between agents who participate in each other's lives. I argue that the discussion has been trapped in traditional dichotomies, and is better served by language that more accurately represents the dynamic interplay between organization and individual. I underwrite this claim by looking at recent changes in British and American legal approaches to corporate responsibility. These provide greater incentives for owners and business leaders to encourage employees to discuss the reflexive nature of legal and moral responsibility in business, facilitate workers to voice their moral concerns, and create structures and processes that allow those concerns to be heard. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Affine agency; Corporate personhood; Moral agency; Responsibility; Teleopathy",

I argue that explicitly this document makes a call for a new theory of economic exchange. Whereas, the traditional scholastic theory of the ""just price"" was focused on ""the principle of the equivalence in value of exchanged goods"" (CV 35), a new theory of exchange must focus instead on ""a metaphysical understanding of the relations between persons"" (CV 53). True, Thomas Aquinas pioneered this new approach to the morality of exchange when he argued that the Golden Rule must take precedence over the logic of the just price: the relation between persons must trump the relation between the goods exchanged. Caritas in Veritate argues further for a new theory of exchange that combines elements of mutual gain with elements of gift-giving. Here again we see a revision of traditional scholastic theory in which every transaction was defined exclusively either as a unilateral gift (subject to norms of distributive justice and charity) or as a bilateral exchange (subject to norms of commutative justice). Benedict, by contrast, calls for a vision of economic life in which gift-giving and exchange are mixed, so that bargains are ""redolent with the spirit of gift"" (CV 37) in a new ""economy of gratuitousness"" (CV 38). I propose to outline a new theory of exchange in which the elements of mutual gain and gift-giving are combined. To do so, I shall have to revise the traditional scholastic analysis of the just price, which was focused on the equality of the goods exchanged and instead focus on the moral equality of the parties to an exchange. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bargain; Benedict XVI; Business ethics Caritas in Veritate; Catholic social teaching; Ethics and economics; Exchange gift; Just price",

The encyclical defines the framework for a new business ethics which appreciates allocative and distributive efficiency, and thus both markets and institutions as improving the human condition, but locates their source and reason outside the economic sphere. It places a clear accent on the ontological connectedness of the economic and ethical dimensions of human action. It is the proper ordering of means towards the end of integral human development that allows mankind to leave a vicious circle of consumerism and enter a virtuous circle that applies the creativity fostered by markets.

Using Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, we found in both studies that team transparency was positively related to team behavioral integrity, which in turn was positively related to team trust.

This is contrasted with the analysis of such relationships through Aristotelian virtue ethics (in particular as interpreted by MacIntyre 1985, 1998, 1999), which is emerging as a strong force in the field of business ethics, and which has strong conceptual similarities with the ideas put forward by Benedict XVI.

Drawing on negotiated order theory, it shows that these perceptions are the result of complex processes of social construction and negotiation, rather than the application of predetermined ethics models or norms. Employees' perceptions appear to be unstable; they are subject to constant alterations, fluctuating with the organizational circumstances, and are likely to create considerable organizational perturbations, especially when managers make complex and ambiguous decisions. This process is illustrated through an ethnographic study that analyzed the evolution of employee perceptions during a three-year crisis-one that led managers to repeatedly postpone salary payments to save jobs. The process approach adopted by the study highlights important dynamics that traditional business ethics approaches overlook, such as the fragility of the construct of managerial responsibility, which cannot be coherent unless it is constantly renegotiated among an organization's various employee groups. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ethical judgment; Ethnography; Managerial responsibility; Negotiated order; Organizational crisis",

We use a survey of existing studies to assess the current stage of CR adoption in forest-based industry and to form a basis for evaluating the wider importance of CR in business, as well as to formulate hypotheses for future research. In conclusion, companies covered in previous research in this study appear to have adopted CR activities mainly with the profit-maximizing assumption.

This article firstly discusses the concept of external assurance as defined by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and its limited application to date outside the statutory financial statement audit. The article then discusses the experience of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) in applying the IAASB framework for external assurance in practice. The benefit of external assurance is primarily to enhance confidence in information for the benefit of users of information who have little control over its production. However, the benefit of external assurance potentially can extend beyond enhancing the credibility of information. Through a case study of developing an assurance reporting framework on internal control in the United Kingdom in 2006, the article firstly demonstrates the benefit of stakeholder engagement in the process. By taking part in collective decision-making over the scope of reporting and related responsibilities, stakeholders obtain a better understanding of the role of assurance reporting and thus are able to align their expectations. Collectively agreeing the basic elements of an assurance reporting framework also means that parties need not negotiate them along with other individual engagement terms, thereby saving time and cost. Secondly, where stakeholders decide to opt for an assertion-based assurance reporting framework, management reports on its internal control procedures and their effectiveness and professional accountants opine on management assertions. This assurance process can facilitate better governance as management explicitly owns primary responsibility over the information rather than attributing it to external accountants. The article finally considers the use of external assurance reporting in a wider context. Assurance services, conducted on a voluntary basis and outside the scope of a statutory financial statements audit, can enhance the credibility of specific information that is relevant to certain stakeholders without adding unnecessary burdens to others that have little to gain from this assurance process. This may be particularly relevant to financial institutions subject to increased scrutiny because of the recent crisis in the banking sector. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Assurance; ICAEW; Internal control; Reporting; Stakeholder; Standards development",

It shows how in some literature on business teamwork, there is a desire to build a team through shared work experiences. It then explains Nancy's view as to why this cannot work, and it enters into Nancy's positive account of how a community should be seen as a web of people communicating and sharing with each other in a variety of ways. The practical conclusion the study draws is that team members need to be careful about allowing goal orientation to obfuscate the richness of the relationships that occur among team members.

The results indicate significant differences between the situationists and absolutists on the one hand, and subjectivists and exceptionists on the other.

Yet, the relationship between law and ethics and its integrative role in defining values are often unclear. While integrity-based ethics programs emphasize ethics values more than law or compliance, viewing ethics as being integrated with law may enhance understanding of an organization's core values. The author refers to this integration of law and ethics as ""substantive ethics,"" analogous to the substantive law that evolves over time, which is applied to ethical breaches and carries sanctions for non-compliance. This article describes the integration of law and ethics as a mid-point between two polar views that define law and ethics either as having no relation or as being one and the same. Since corporations expressly state which laws they follow, a sample of corporate compliance statements is used to demonstrate this integrative mid-point. The sample also reveals that corporate ethics codes rarely express ethics and law as being integrated per se. Therefore, the author creates an example of a securities law compliance statement that is introduced with an integrative perspective of law and ethics.

Further, the perception of these notions can differ in the small-business world from the original academic definitions. This article focuses on the cognition of small-business owner-managers. Given the impact of small-business owner-managers on their ventures, corporate responsibility and ethical issues can take a different route in SMEs. The small-business owner-manager is able to shape the corporate culture and to enact values other than profit. Adopting a cognitive perspective, we have identified how the small-business owner-manager makes sense of notions linked to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business ethics. The concept of sensemaking has recently been applied to CSR (Basu and Pallazzo, 2008; Cramer et al., 2006). Applying a cognitive perspective to small-business owners may help in explaining specific phenomena found within small-business ownership. For this research, the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) is used, a method that has not previously been widely applied in the business and society field. Our findings to an extent invalidate the confusion in terminology found in the academic literature. Small-business owner-managers, pragmatically and rather clearly, differentiate among the various concepts related to corporate responsibility and business ethics but, at the same time, they recognise the interrelationships and interdependencies of these concepts. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how small-business owners think and integrate corporate responsibility and ethical issues into their decision-making. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; cognition; corporate governance; corporate social respon- sibility; entrepreneur; family business; perception; Repertory Grid Technique; sensemaking; small business; SME",

In a recent contribution to the Journal of Business Ethics, Brian Schaefer goes so far as to suggest that a proponent of shareholder theory cannot coherently and consistently embrace any moral position other than philosophical libertarianism. The view that managers have a fiduciary obligation to advance the interests of shareholders exclusively is depicted as fundamentally incompatible with the acknowledgement of natural positive duties - duties to aid others that have not been acquired by some prior commitment or transaction. I argue that Schaefer is mistaken. Positive duties are incompatible with the shareholder model only if we must contribute to their fulfilment in the corporate context; only if we have some reason to think that it is not possible or not permissible to discharge these obligations entirely in our private lives or through our various other roles and capacities.

We provide a comprehensive overview about the different types of standards and discuss their role as part of a new institutional infrastructure for corporate responsibility. Based on this, it is argued that IAS can advance corporate responsibility on a global level because they contribute to the closure of some omnipresent governance gaps. IAS also improve the preparedness of an organization to give an explanation and a justification to relevant stakeholders for its judgments, intentions, acts and omissions when appropriately called upon to do so. However, IAS also face a variety of problems impeding their potential to help address social and environmental issues.

Closely following the analysis approach used for similar studies in the economics and finance literature, we present the first study to examine whether there exists an empirical regularity in the bibliometric patterns of research productivity in the business ethics literature. Our results present strong evidence that there indeed exists a distinct empirical regularity. It is the so-called Generalized Lotka's Law of scientific productivity pattern: the number of authors publishing n papers is about 1/nc of those publishing one paper. We discuss the likely processes that underlie the productivity pattern postulated by the Generalized Lotka's Law. We find that the value of the exponent c is equal to about 2.6 for the comprehensive bibliometric data across the two leading business ethics journals. The observed research productivity pattern in the business ethics area, a relatively young discipline, is interestingly very consistent with those found in much older, related business disciplines like economics, accounting, and finance.

Yet the modes of including meaningful public participation in the decision-making process for MSP remain undetermined. At the same time, the Aarhus Convention (on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters) empowers non-governmental organisations to hold EU Member States to account. Consequently the issue of transparency will gain increased importance, as will linkages between human and environmental rights.

This paper seeks to frame ten effective implications/lessons of the most recent bank bailouts of 2007-2009 in the Western economy model when analyzing actual shareholders’ value retrenchment or growth opportunities. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a literature review and a re-conceptualized framework of event study methodology, secondary data analysis of qualitative and quantitative information. Findings – Recent bank bailouts relate to: global bailout interconnections, economic downturn and liquidity boost, abnormal returns, efficiency recovery, evasion of social costs, new opportunities for M&A, new risk management applications, opportunistic investors and eventually patience. Most important, findings recommend shareholders to grasp opportunities for bargains from bailout banks as well as to harvest their existing investments. At the same time, economic education and control become another important solution. Research limitations/implications – Consequently, as the paper targets most recent bailouts, a still ongoing event, there is a need for extended financial data that could enhance some cause-related solutions after economic recovery. Practical implications – The practicality of the paper refers to guiding management of both government and financial institutions on the choice for reasoning bank bailouts, providing some critical thinking views to investors as well as academics. Originality/value – Research or studies on the most recent financial crises bailouts have not yet been written, due to the process continuation.

As scholars are calling for ""responsible leadership"" to become more of the norm, organizations are being pushed to enact new values, such as ""responsibility"" and ""sustainability,"" and pay more attention to the effects of their actions on their stakeholders. The purpose of this study is to open up a line of research in business ethics on the concept of ""authenticity"" as it can be applied in modern organizational life and more specifically to think through some of the foundational questions about the logic of values. We shall argue that the idea of simply ""acting on one's values"" or ""being true to oneself"" is at best a starting point for thinking about authenticity. We develop the idea of the poetic self as a project of seeking to live authentically. We see being authentic as an ongoing process of conversation that not only starts with perceived values but also involves one's history, relationships with others, and aspirations. Authenticity entails acting on these values for individuals and organizations and thus also becomes a necessary starting point for ethics. After all, if there is no motivation to justify one's actions either to oneself or to others, then as Sartre has suggested, morality simply does not come into play. We argue that the idea of responsible leadership can be enriched with this more nuanced idea of the self and authenticity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Authenticity; Ethical theory; Poetic self; Responsible leadership; Values",

The weak business culture and a symbiosis of business and politics have actually allowed for the bulk of self-serving and unethical decisions made by the Icelandic business and political elite. In order to illustrate this point, 10 expert interviews have been conducted within the period of 6 months in 2009 to support in-depth research carried out by the authors. The article also discloses questionable business practices that have recently come to the attention of the public both in Iceland and abroad and that ultimately facilitated the downfall of the Icelandic economy. While traditional corruption has probably played its role in this downfall, the measures currently employed to determine its level did not account for various peculiarities of Icelandic society. The article thus argues that there was a high level of corruption in Iceland, but it was outside of the traditional definition. This other corruption has ultimately prevented the government from acting appropriately upon the questionable business practices mentioned above. The article also offers some general recommendations which should be useful to both policy makers and business leaders wishing to engage in business activities in a transparent, ethical manner and learn from the tragic Icelandic experience. Among these recommendations are the necessity to recognize the limitations of current definitions of corruption, as well as a word of caution to commercial enterprises to pay a close attention not only to commonly accepted indices and mainstream reports but also to a country's history, culture, and political environment, prior to making any sort of investment decisions in that country. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business culture; business ethics; corruption; Iceland",

Based on a study of online auctions, we provide evidence that even respondents who have direct knowledge of the situation portrayed in the scenario may develop significantly different assessments of the level of unethical behavior. Further, those assessments may be conditioned in different ways by the same moderating variables.

We argue that family involvement in business influences the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of a firm's dominant coalition. Together these factors determine the extent of the dominant coalition's intentions to undertake PES. Further, family firms with lower levels of relationship conflict within the controlling family will be more successful in translating the dominant coalition's intentions to allocate resources for the pursuit of PES.

When organizations espouse their commitment to IAS but do not put forth the effort necessary to operationally enact that commitment, a ""credibility cover"" is created that perpetuates business as usual. In other words, the legitimacy that organizations gain by formally adopting the standards may shield the organization from closer scrutiny, thus enabling rather than constraining the types of activities the standards were designed to discourage. There is a lack of research on why certain types of IAS are more prone than others to being decoupled from organizational practices. Applying a neo-institutional perspective to IAS, we theorize that the structural dimensions of the types of standards themselves can increase the likelihood of organizations adopting IAS standards in form but not in function. © 2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Empirical findings based on the ISO 14001 standard at the facility level support this view: Quality of standard implementation affects facilities' environmental performance, and environmental performance of certified and non-certified facilities does not differ significantly for the overall sample and low-quality implemented, while high-quality implementers have better environmental performance than their noncertified counterparts.

These rents have implications regarding the property rights of the firms capital-contributing constituencies. We identify and analyze the types of rent associated with the newly private firm. Compared to public firms, going private allows owners the potential to partition part of the residual risk to bond holders and employees, rendering them to be co-residual risk bearers with owners. We propose that new promotion-based contracts with bond holders and employees, reflecting their particular investments, be negotiated as the firm migrates from public to private status. These contracts should acknowledge the firm's intent to maximize shareholder value and its need to take the risks necessary to do so, but support that the firm's survival not be undermined due to its possibly opportunistic owners. ©2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Similarly, we argue that external contextual factors, including competitive intensity and technological turbulence, can influence organizational anomie. We extend anomie and ethics research by considering the impact of these firm cultural and environmental factors according to whether firms are publicly-traded or privately-held. Findings demonstrate that a number of firm cultural and environmental factors can generate or reduce anomie in firms.

Then, in September 2008, the president and other officials created an unwise sense of urgency that delays in implementation show to have been greatly exaggerated.

The analysis emphasizes that during the emerging phase of the standard, the potential lack of consensus within the constituents of the national institutional environment concerning the value of a new standard could send mixed signals to firms about the standard. The results show that in the early phase of adoption, regulative and normative forces within the institutional environment can work against each other. Results also show that regulative or coercive forces play a relatively more important role in the early phase of adoption of the standard than in the subsequent phases of diffusion.

Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, accounting fraud in large corporations, and physical and sexual harassment in the military implicate not only the individuals involved, but the organizations and fields in which they happened. In this paper we describe such situations as instances of ""moral collapse"" and develop a multi-level theory of moral collapse that draws on institutional theory as its central orienting lens. We draw on institutional theory because of its explicit concern with the relationships among individual beliefs and actions, the organizations within which they occur, and the collective social structures in which norms, rules and beliefs are anchored. Our theory of moral collapse has two main elements. First, we argue that morality in organizations is embedded in nested systems of individuals, organizations and moral communities in which ideology and regulation flow ""down"" from moral communities through organizations to individuals, and moral ideas and influence flow ""upward"" from individuals through organizations to moral communities. Second, we argue that moral collapse is associated with breakdowns in these flows, and explore conditions under which such breakdowns are likely to occur. © 2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

The concept of responsible leadership presented here draws on deliberative practices and discursive conflict resolution, combining the macro-view of the business firm as a political actor with the micro-view of leadership. Ideal responsible leadership conduct thereby goes beyond the dyadic leader-follower interaction to include all stakeholders. The paper offers a definition and operationalization of responsible leadership. The studies that have been conducted to develop the discursive responsible leadership scale validated the scale, discriminated it from other leadership scales, and demonstrated its utility in affecting unethical behavior and job satisfaction in organizations. Responsible leadership is shown to be first, dependent on the hierarchical level in an organization; second, capable of reducing unethical treatment of employees; and finally, a means of enhancing the job satisfaction of employees. The paper concludes with study limitations, future research directions and practical implications. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Construct development; CSR; Leadership ethics; Responsible leadership",

Sustainable business success requires sustained existence in a corporation's political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental contexts. Far beyond the traditional economic focus, consumers, governments and public interest groups alike increasingly expect the business sector to take on more social and environmental responsibilities. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the model in which economic, social and environmental responsibilities are fulfilled simultaneously. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence that demonstrates genuine widespread adoption of CSR in practice, and its underlying reasons. Though research in CSR has been rapidly growing, its commercial reality and implications need to be further improved if it is to inspire corporations to voluntarily adopt CSR. In the literature, Carroll's four-dimensional (economic, legal, ethical and discretionary) CSR framework offers a theoretical basis for developing an empirically based model to explain why and how profit-motivated managers take up CSR voluntarily. Our study has developed a structural equation model to identify the key factors and their interactions that influence economically motivated managers to take on voluntary CSR, and validate Carroll's four-dimensional construct. The results support Carroll's four-dimensional CSR framework, with the exception of the link pertaining to the relationship between economic and discretionary/voluntary responsibility. This characterises the economic reality that financial market-driven economic responsibility does not automatically translate into social responsibility. Nevertheless, the empirical results demonstrate that corporations can be led to engage in more voluntary CSR activities to achieve social good when appropriate legal and ethical controls are in place. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carroll; corporate social responsibility; discretionary; economic; ethical; legal; sustainability; voluntary",

While theory suggests that online privacy is a CSR, only very few studies in the business ethics literature have connected these two. Based on a study of CSR disclosures, this article contributes to the existing literature by exploring whether and how the largest IT companies embrace online privacy as a CSR. The findings indicate that only a small proportion of the companies have comprehensive privacy programs, although more than half of them voice moral or relational motives for addressing online privacy. The privacy measures they have taken are primarily compliance measures, while measures that stimulate a stakeholder dialogue are rare. Overall, a wide variety of approaches to addressing privacy was found, which suggests that no institutionalization of privacy practices has taken place as yet.

We argue that where principal institutions intersect (i.e., family and business); managerial perceptions of stakeholder salience will be different and more complex than where institutions are based on a single dominant logic. We propose that (1) whereas utilitarian power is more likely in the general business case, normative power is more typical in family business stakeholder salience; (2) whereas in a general business context legitimacy is socially constructed; for family stakeholders, legitimacy is based on heredity; and (3) whereas temporality and criticality are somewhat independent in general-business urgency, they are linked in the family business case because of family ties and family-centered non-economic goals.

This paper represents a two year outcome assessment of a community outreach program that targeted first-generation, lowincome, and minority students from various Southern California School Districts intended to motivate students to seek college education in general and business education and entrepreneurship in particular. The outreach program was developed with a mission to overcome issues that usually restrict the college ambitions of the targeted population. Over the past two years (2007 and 2008), one hundred and eighteen high school juniors participated in a three-week business camp that introduced them to topics such as market and economics, success skills (including management, organization, creating an organization website, and presentations and job interviewing techniques), entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and business ethics. All classes were delivered by college professors and volunteer business and community leaders. Before the program, a combined 78% of participants indicated their willingness to go to college, while in the post assessment survey 96% indicated their desire to attend college. Only 2% indicated as ""not sure"" and 2% abstained due to illness. Additionally, on the post test, 50% indicated their desire to own a business in the future compared to 20% on the pre-test.

I also argue that the rising challenge from China and India, strong independence movements in Latin America and prolonged socio-economic crisis in Western Europe, as well as the recent events in the US, made it no longer possible to ignore the ethical dimension of business activities. Finally, I signal the fundamental questions of business ethics, such as. 1. What is ownership, and is it moral? 2. Are relationships between labour and capital based on sound moral principles? 3. Where is the border between ethical and unethical methods in fighting the competition? 4. What is the definition of ""fair profit""?

In this framework, firms can influence their probability of liquidation by choosing an appropriate capital structure. Also, the literature suggests NFS bargaining power may affect firm financing decisions. In the current article we investigate these ideas for initial financing decisions by business start-ups, where ex ante failure risk is high and NFS must decide whether to make relationship-specific investments. We find that start-ups imposing larger costs on their NFS following liquidation significantly reduce leverage. This effect is strengthened when suppliers have greater bargaining power. We also document a marginally negative effect of NFS liquidation costs on the proportion of bank loans. Finally, business start-ups rely less on bank loans when customers and suppliers are in a powerful bargaining position. © 2010 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association.",,

The principles articulate (at an abstract level) citizens' rights; these rights create interests across all aspects of society, including in the space of economic activity; and therefore, stakeholders - as citizens - have legitimate interests in the space of economic activity. This approach to stakeholder theory suggests a political interpretation of Boatright's Moral Market approach, one that emphasizes the rights/place of citizens. And this approach to stakeholder theory - in terms of citizens - raises a further question, what rights and obligations do economic agents have, beyond those attached to their roles as citizens? Rawls would reject additional rights and obligations of this sort for two reasons, one tied to freedom and one tied to pluralism. Rawls' work therefore presses us to re-conceptualize the place of ethical claims in the economic context. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Moral Markets approach; organizational ethics; Rawls; social contract theory; stakeholder theory (normative foundations)",

This potential could be highlighted with system thinking and the use of change management knowledge, promoting not only innovations within technology but also within organizational improvement. We propose process models and performance indicators as means of highlighting improvement potential and thus breaking down normative business ethics' requirements to an opertionalizable corporate level: Good business ethics should focus on maximizing stakeholder value in relation to harm done. Our results indicate that focusing on supply chains reveals previously unknown innovation potential that seems to be related to limited system understanding. The assumption is that increased visibility of opportunities will act as a driver for change.

As part of what has been termed the new economic geography, this area of research is less than 20 years old, and is now developed sufficiently so that the discussion can be organized around certain stylized and commonly accepted facts: • Innovation is spatially concentrated. • Geography provides a platform to organize economic activity. • All places are not equal: urbanization, localization, and diversity. • Knowledge spillovers are geographically localized. • Knowledge spillovers are nuanced, subtle, pervasive, and not easily amenable to measurement. • Local universities are necessary but not sufficient for innovation. • Innovation benefits from local buzz and global pipelines. • Places are defined over time by an evolutionary process. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize recent work on innovation and location in light of these themes, and to consider how these stylized facts shed light on the broader process of technological change and economic growth. While firms are one venue to organize economic activity, the resources required to generate innovation are typically not confined to a single firm, and geography provides another means to organize the factors of production. Geography is additionally a venue for complex multifaceted social relationships, and human community and creativity that are beyond the economic sphere. Economies are complex: highly integrated, globally interconnected, and highly agglomerated on centers of activity. There is always the temptation to analyze economic institutions and actors individually; however, the new economic geography literature considers the large context. Of course, once the analysis is open to consider geography there is a need to understand history, building a deep contextualized understanding of a place and the relationships that define it. The present review of the literature summarizes the advancements made in this stream of inquiry, but also indicates that many open avenues for research remain, thus encouraging others to contribute to the emerging field of economic geography. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Agglomeration economies; Geography of innovation; Knowledge spillovers; Localization; New economic geography; Urbanization",

It considers lessons learned and is informed by discussions that have taken place since publication of the 'Roadmap for Maritime Spatial Planning: Achieving Common Principles in the EU'. New goals are based on horizontal planning tools that cut across sea-related sectoral policies and support joined up policy making. It is in this context that Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) emerged as an essential process for sustainable decision making. The OSPAR Commission undertook an overview of national planning systems within its administrative boundaries, which confirmed spatial plans reduced conflicts. However, problems exist accessing good quality data and dealing with entrenched sectoral views. Furthermore, the transboundary nature of marine resources requires cooperation between neighbouring states. In 2006, Portugal developed a 'National Sea Strategy' that recognized the importance of developing its maritime space while valuing marine habitats and biodiversity. MSP development of the Portuguese sea commenced in 2008 and findings are now evaluated. They showed adaptation of existing tools to be possible and desirable, provided undertaken cautiously and found conceptual ambiguities were barriers to conflict resolution. Furthermore they showed management strategies should be designed and analysed on a case by case basis, recognising temporal and spatial variations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","OSPAR Commission; Stakeholder engagement","European Union; marine policy; marine resource; policy making; spatial planning; stakeholder; transboundary cooperation; Portugal"

This article provides an overview to the latter field with application to environmental damage due to climate change. The aim is to provide an economic context for the papers in this special issue. The article outlines four essential elements in what has become a vast literature in the economics of sustainability in the context of climate change. First is the dilemma in valuing the distant future which concerns the vexed issue of discounting outcomes that are expected to occur over a very long time horizon. The second is the related characteristics of uncertainty and irreversibility that create an option value in taking action. The third element is the peculiarities of natural capital (arising from the natural environment) compared with reproducible capital (things we make that are used to produce goods and services). The post-neoclassical notions of social capital and knowledge capital are also briefly mentioned. The fourth element is how to manage the global "" commons"" , the prime example of which is the climate. This article is written for the general business reader with an understanding of basic economic concepts and therefore avoids mathematics.

While research has documented sustainability reporting and looked at reports' contents, studies on MNC reporting as institutionalised phenomenon, considering evolving patterns at the firm level, have been lacking. This paper presents developments and trajectories of sustainability reporting by a panel of Fortune Global 250 firms, and also explores MNCs' reporting trends in their sector-specific settings. Using three data points covering a period of nine years, five patterns are found: consistent reporters, late adopters, laggards, inconsistent reporters, and consistent non-reporters. Different dynamics can be seen in the various sectors, with some in which reporting has become established and others where it is more emerging.

This study directly addresses this issue by using upper echelon theory, and the KLD Research Analytics CSP ratings, to show that observable CEO characteristics predict differences in CSP between firms, even when firm and industry characteristics are controlled for. Using a sample of 650 public US firms I find that strong or exemplary CSP, as measured by the strengths categories of KLD's ratings, is positively related to the CEO having a bachelor's degree in humanities, having a breadth of career experience and being female. I find that KLD strength ratings are negatively related to the CEO having a bachelor's degree in economics and to their level of short-term compensation. Preliminary tests of causality support the assertion that these effects reflect CEO discretion rather than being an artifact of reverse causality. Significant relationships between the CEO characteristics and poor social performance as measured by the concerns categories of KLD's ratings are not found. This suggests that CEOs have more discretion in influencing strong and exemplary social performance than in impacting poor CSP. Implications, particularly for economics education, are discussed.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper explores the grounding of views of managerial capture in the Habermasian ideal of participative democracy. It then attempts to re-conceive the understanding of capture by drawing on Foucault's account of disciplinary power and its constitutive effects on subjectivity. Findings: Capture appears as a managerial mindset constituted by the pervasive demand for shareholder value. When stakeholder issues are considered within this frame they must be recast in ways that pose no moral or emotional challenge to the dominant logic of shareholder maximisation. This moral distancing or amoralisation can be traced to the accounting practices that make management visible to their superiors (board of directors or more senior levels of management) in terms of their utility. In seeking the recognition of their superiors, individual managers make themselves subjects of this deeper form of capture. Practical implications: A less restricted lens for conducting future research in managerial capture is offered. While in practice stakeholder engagement fails to live up to the Habermasian ideal, it still holds some promise for delivering management accountability. Originality/value: The paper shows that ideas of power and subjectivity are key to an understanding of environmental accountability and open the social and environmental accountability literature to a new set of interesting problematics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accounting procedures; Corporate social responsibility; Management accounting; Social accounting",

Design/methodology/approach: The objective is achieved by considering compliance leadership as a strategy within a modern company. If the highest layer of stewardship of the firm (directors) explicitly accepts a conventional definition of business ethics (the law, best practice, a set of values in a specific hierarchy), then the author can measure this agreement and benchmark it against the highest known standards of corporate governance. Findings: Rational shareholders and managers will behave morally and find acceptable categorical imperatives to govern their behaviour. The delivery and preservation of long-term value demand that firms build capabilities to self-regulate and co-shape their environment, particularly if highly regulated. The paper suggests a way to organise the compliance leadership within some well-known business structures and present the idea that the chief executive officer of a firm who operates in a complex regulatory environment must make compliance a significant part if not the core element of his or her overall strategy. Research limitations/implications: Some arguments highlighting weaknesses in the Kantian arguments have not been fully discussed. A global initiative that measures the relationship between ethical maturity and share price has not been undertaken in the writing of this paper. Practical implications: Twenty-first century management must ensure the health and resilience of their company's culture to successfully manage and overcome the daily ethical questions that arise across all levels and layers of the organisation as a first priority and that whole business models can be built around this mission. Regulators should be accountable for recognising cultural crisis within the firms they regulate in order to balance the reliance on quantitative measurements of success and to navigate the complexity of the largest players in the market. Originality/value: The paper builds on earlier research by the author that rational norms of behaviour are core business capabilities that will produce industry leaders that can change the risk landscape of the industries wherein these firms operate. This new leadership will be demanded by the rational shareholder and will transform firms into stakeholder firms capable of interacting with their environment and creating and sustaining value over the longest term. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate strategy; Ethics",

The crises of the recent past reveal huge, and in some cases criminal, failures of both ethics and leadership in finance, business and government. We posit that mainstream economic theory's construct of 'homo economicus' and its faith in the 'invisible hand' of the market constitute deeply flawed foundations upon which alone policy may be built and, farthermore, that these problematic foundations exert substantial shaping power over the institutional and discursive landscapes in which international business is transacted. Analogously, we argue that dominant approaches to business ethics and corporate social responsibility are, if not incorrect, at least in need of revisiting in terms of questioning their basic assumptions. Instead of the smugness of Western (especially Anglo-American) attitudes towards other ways of thinking, valuing and organising, it appears clear that openness, cooperation and co-creation between the developed and developing worlds is a basic prerequisite for dealing with the global challenges facing not just leaders, but humanity as a whole. This objective of stimulating discussion between dominant and marginal voices has guided our selection of papers for this Special Issue. We have thus included not only representatives of research from within the parameters of mainstream business ethics, IB or leadership scholarship, but also innovative contributions from fields such as military history, information technology, regulation, spirituality and sociology. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","challenges; ethics; leadership; moral compass",

The first part of the article determines that local officials in the Channel Islands disposed of operative margins, but that - in the interest of collaboration - these were not always used to the full. This article then details institutional factors that contributed to commonalities between the two bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey, as they faced up to occupation. The second part of this article follows up with the dissimilarities, one of which is that Guernsey travelled further down the road to collaboration than her sister island. Social capital depletion is credited as being responsible for this; and this situation was further compounded by lack of 'ethical leadership'. The final part explores the relationship between social capital and leadership ethics, suggesting that virtue serves as a catalyst for social capital stock in crisis situations. The core research outcome is that ethical leadership produces tangible efficiency and moral effects in situations of extreme duress (such as Nazi Occupation) where one could have expected very little or no scope for such a thing. This is an uplifting message that runs counter to scepticism as to the practical value of business ethics.

The argument is developed by means of a framework that integrates legal systems and financial structures. Hypotheses relating to environmental responsibility have been tested using Innovest data gathered between 2002 and 2007 from 645 companies in 16 countries; and hypotheses relating to social responsibility have been tested using Innovest data gathered between 2004 and 2007 from 600 companies. The findings demonstrate that legal systems influence corporate responsibility (CR) in both social and environmental spheres. They also support the claim that corporations are more likely to act in environmentally responsible ways when there are strong and well-enforced state regulations in place to ensure such behavior. Company size is shown to have a greater impact on CR than either excess cash or performance. Large companies tend to be more visible than small ones do, and society expects them to behave in a more socially and environmentally responsible manner regardless of their financial performance or available cash. Finally, these findings support the hypothesis that capital structure significantly influences CR: companies with a high number of publicly held shares and a low percentage of debt are more likely than others to commit themselves to social and environmental activities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate social responsibility; Europe; influence of financial structures; influence of legal systems",

It uses a cross section survey of 505 CEOs of Argentinean firms to gather information on environmental attitudes and a stakeholder theory framework to design and interpret the statistical analyses. It is underpinned by theoretical and empirical findings in the literature on stakeholder management, targeting in particular studies that deal with corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Latin America. Its general aim is to gain a deeper empirical understanding of the coherence between managers' perceptions of stakeholder pressures and the importance they are given in corporate CSR strategies through an empirical investigation of environmental management (EM) decisions. In doing so, it uncovers general differences in the way firms perceive and treat groups of stakeholders. It also detects variations across firms, observing that some are typically proactive in their response to stakeholder pressures whilst others are less responsive. Profiling the various stakeholder networks and the corporate response strategies in this way encourages the development of stakeholder-focussed policies and corporate strategies that emphasise communications, awareness and a clear sense of direction. It concludes that CSR appears to be more effective in the protection of the environment than previously reported.

At the time, many believed this to represent the final historic victory of the capitalist socioeconomic system, having proven its superiority and irreplaceability for civilization. However, just one decade later, the immanent structural weakness and contradictions of the capitalist system have risen to the surface in dramatic fashion, intensi-fied by its radical, neoliberal variant, which has removed all restrictions on the unabashed impetus toward profit maximization and the accumulation of wealth. The rate of property and income polarization has increased, both on the national as well as international level, the global concentration and power of financial capital, as well as its speculative nature, have been strengthened, and the devastation of the natural environment has continued with possibly catastrophic consequences. On the other hand, we are beginning to see the end of American economic and political global hegemony. The spectacular unbroken thirty-year-long economic rise of China (followed by that of India) and the soon-anticipated transfer of global economic power to Asia herald the end of a global superpower's dominance, the birth of a new multilateral international order, and thus also the end of neo-liberal capitalism's reign. Those new tendencies gave impetus to various initiatives for transforming the existing neo-liberal model into one of ""moral"", ""socially responsible"" capitalism - ""capitalism with a human face"". At the same time, discussions were revived regarding the relevance of socialist ideas under the new circumstances of the 21st century. The goal of this paper is to re-examine that two-centuries-old idea that has so far not had much luck in being achieved. To that end, the evolution and characteristics of various socialist doctrines are analyzed, an attempt is made to define the essence of an authentic socialist vision, after which the failed application of socialist projects in several of the most important countries and the reasons behind those failures are examined, ending with an inquiry into the prospects for achieving that intended more humane, just, and functional society in a contemporary, post-industrial, information-based, globalized world in which the dominant factor is still financial and corporate capital. Discussion of the mentioned topics has led the author to the following conclusions: a) the capitalist system has exhausted its historical dynamic and progressive functions, and, due to the innate weaknesses and contradictions that its fundamentalist, neo-liberal variant has brought to a critical level, has become a hindrance to the further advancement of civilization; b) for that reason, next to come will be either the transformation of the capitalist system into a social, functional, and ecologically sustainable model, or its replacement with a new, socialist system ruled by equality, justice, tolerance, and community, as well as the dominance of the power and interest of work over the interests of capital; c) contemporary technological advancement, along with corresponding institutional solutions, allow not only the basic but also higher cultural requirements of all people to be met, and enable work to be transformed from an existential essentiality to a natural need; d) however, achieving this new society of freedom, equality, and harmony depends not only on radical institutional conversion, i.e., changing the relationship between economic and political power as well as social relationships, but primarily on changing people's individual and collective consciousness, and elevating that consciousness to a higher cognitive, humane, and ethical plane by overcoming egocentrism in favor of empathy, tolerance, and community; e) despite efforts to reform the capitalist system through acknowledging ethical, social, and ecological requirements, that system will sooner or later be replaced by a new socio-economic model that will be based on a humanist philosophy instead of the utilitarian philosophy that is the hallmark of capitalism.","""Moral capitalism""; Breakdown of ""statist socialism""; Democratic socialism; Global hegemony of the USA; Multilateral international order; Triumph of neoliberalism; Worldwide crisis of the capitalist system",

Legal and extra-legal demands are dynamically changing; almost no organizational function is unaffected. Owing to the outsourcing wave of the last decade, in particular purchasing and supply management (PSM) plays an ever more important role in assuring sustainable production of the firm's products offered in the marketplace. The supply base of many Western firms has become increasingly global and spend volumes have shifted towards emerging countries. In order to avoid the risk of reputational damage to the buying company, the PSM department must ensure that their international suppliers comply with their corporate codes of conduct and that environmental and social misconduct at supplier premises does not occur.

Thousands of paratransit operators would have to formalise their businesses, or merge into new or existing operator entities in order to participate in the new systems. There is, however, an absence of accessible business plans and regulatory regime proposals around which paratransit can be engaged to convince it to alter its current modus operandi. A large number of national, regional and local paratransit groupings have furthermore indicated their resistance to the planned networks on the grounds of insufficient consultation, an unclear future role in the system and employee redundancies. Should this deadlock not be resolved, it seems unlikely that the planned networks will be realised in the proposed timeframes, if indeed at all. This paper investigates the South African passenger transport policy framework that has contributed to the current deadlock, and explores appropriate approaches to engaging paratransit operators on a system of contracting, competition and ownership that recognises the sector's aspirations and fragmented nature, yet contributes towards improved passenger transport services. It is the authors' view that paratransit reform is a highly context-specific process, even at the sub-city level, and that this could prevent transferring paratransit regulatory and integration approaches across countries, and even cities in the same country, without adaptation to local conditions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Paratransit; Public transport reform; Regulatory reform; Stakeholder engagement; Transport policy",

From the perspective of virtue ethics, we take a step forward for the literature and propose the ethical obligations and active influence of accounting firms on clients' immoral behaviors. We then empirically investigate the influence of accounting firms on the immoral informational disclosure of China's listed companies. Our research goes beyond some of the traditional perceptions on accounting firms such as irrelevant excuse, capability discrimination, forced auditor rotation, and maximum audit tenure.

Assessing CSP has become in France an issue around which an organizational field has emerged in the mid 90s. The quest for legitimacy appears as a powerful driver for all the organizations in this field, but the strategies that social analysis and rating organizations deploy to achieve this aim differ significantly. Using a Weberian methodology, we have identified two ideal types of strategy: conservative (perpetuating the societal status quo) and activist (trying to impel change). We argue that these differences in strategies reflect ideological oppositions. Here also we have typified two opposite ideologies: utilitarian and non-utilitarian. Conservative strategies appear to be embedded in a utilitarian ideology; in the short term, they may seem more successful than activist strategies, but in the long term, their future appears more uncertain. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Activism; Conservatism; CSP; CSR; Ideal type; Ideology; Legitimacy; Organizational field; Social analysis; Social rating; SRI; Utilitarianism",

Typically, business ethics cases are used to teach moral reasoning by exposing students to real-life situations which puts them in the position of a decision-maker faced with a moral dilemma. Drawing on a critical management studies' (CMS) critique of mainstream business ethics, this article argues that this 'ideal-type' decision-focused case underplays the social, political and economic factors which shape managerial decisions. An alternative 'dark side' case approach is presented, which highlights the structural features of capitalism and the role of government in regulating the market. The 'dark side' approach is illustrated with the case of a New Zealand woman, dependent on an oxygen machine, who died when her power was disconnected by her State-owned electricity supplier because of an unpaid bill. The case considers the actions of both the company and the industry regulator within the context of a 'light-handed' approach to government regulation. The article concludes with a discussion of how this approach to the case method, which moves beyond managers and their moral dilemmas, can provide students with a deeper understanding of the complexity of business ethics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; case teaching; critical management studies; management education; professionalisation",

This narrowness helped the field establish itself during the 1980s, when American management, under pressure from finance and heightened competition, was unreceptive to any limitations on its autonomy. Relying, however, on top-down approaches inspired by Aristotle, Locke, and Kant, while ignoring the consequentialism of Mill and Rawls, made the field totally reliant upon the good will of these same corporate executives for generating any impact. Trends in employee compensation, finance, regulation, government procurement, and taxpayer subsidies suggest that Business Ethics has failed to significantly influence corporate behavior, a result that would have not surprised the realists of the post-war generation of Business and Society scholars. If Business Ethics is to prove relevant in the contemporary world, the field needs to acknowledge past failures and develop new approaches.

These classifications are developed and reinforced over time and are reflective of the regional commodity history, infrastructure and policy. In essence, the 'region' simultaneously provides a space of opportunity and constrains the possibilities for adaptation.

I contribute to the literature on corporate responsibility standards in general and SA 8000 in particular by showing (a) that attempts to standardise corporate responsibility can only be successful insofar as we recognise that compliance with SA 8000's rules requires a 'fresh judgement' every time they are applied, (b) that SA 8000 should not be pushed down the supply chain as such coercion does not require a truly responsible decision by suppliers and eventually leads to moral mediocrity and (c) that the necessarily time-consuming reflections about the singular contexts within which SA 8000 is applied challenge the urgent need for implementing this standard.

We focus on the web of living stories as a Derridian deconstructive move, which allows us to say something important about their relation to narrative and to develop a storytelling ethics. Our thesis is that resituating the relationship between narrative and living story invites exploration of the plurality of narratives that treat living stories as supplementary. We claim that this deconstructive move allows us to rethink politics and ethics anew. Storytelling ethics opens new spaces for marginalized other(s) voices and creates an awareness of our complicity and responsibility for others.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used in this paper was exploratory and qualitative, including the analysis of secondary data and semi-structured interviews. Findings: Using the New Zealand Auditor-General's best practice guidelines for a public sector audit committee as a benchmark, the paper finds that the DHB rates moderately well in terms of ""effectiveness potential"". However, factors are identified concerning the audit committee members' independence, competence, tenure, and remuneration, which impinge upon the overall effectiveness of the audit committee. Despite apparent shortcomings in these areas, the informal networks between audit committee members and management serve to maximise the ""realisation"" of what potential effectiveness exists. As a result, the audit committee is perceived by its stakeholders (management, auditors, and committee members) as being a valuable tool to assist the DHB board in achieving proper governance. Practical implications: There are no specific regulatory or legislative requirements for establishing audit committees in the New Zealand public sector. The findings from this paper may be useful to public sector entities that are considering establishing an audit committee and to entities, including the one in this paper, that wish to improve the effectiveness of their existing audit committees.

This article approaches the issue from the perspective of team production, and will propose a new form of corporate governance: enlightened corporate governance, which takes into consideration the specific investments of employees. The article argues that, in addition to shareholders, employees also bear a residual risk which arises due to their specific investments. This residual risk presents a valid and legitimate basis for residual claims. In this way, employees can be seen as residual claimants due to the fact that their income depends upon a hazardous quasi rent. Therefore, this article will call on the fiduciary duty of board members to protect those employees who are exposed to such residual risks and may thus be vulnerable as a result. This leads to a fundamental change of perspective on the ""theory of the firm"" - a change which will adopt the theories of new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory in order to promote business ethics research. Against this background, enlightened corporate governance aims to follow the criterion of specific investments as a legitimate basis for residual claims. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the consequences for board members, and to promote the sharing of control and ownership.

This theoretical model has eight premises. It begins with the fundamental premise that environmental change puts the planet at risk. Given that industry has a great impact on the environment and that society legitimates industry it is argued that industry has a duty to act. As the present situation appears to put the planet in jeopardy, there is a need for a new relationship between industry and the environment. It is argued that, although there should be a long-term radical reorientation, in the immediate short-term sustainable development should be the target. There is a need for a measurement system to assess industry's impact, but current accounting is inadequate for a variety of reasons (e.g., monetary dependence, capitalist orientation, business focus, reliance on neoclassical economics, numerical quantification, and technical accounting practices). There is thus a need for a new holistic accounting which captures corporate environmental impacts. Finally, it is argued that companies because of their stewardship function should report their environmental accounting to their stakeholders. There are several implications from the acceptance of this theoretical model for organisations and accountants. First, at the general level, given the severity of the environmental problems which face us, it would seem prudent for managers and accountants to take immediate action to address these threats. Second, the traditional accounting paradigm with its narrow focus on accounting numbers does not capture the environmental consequences of organisational activity. Third, as part of innovation and experimentation there is a continued need to explore potential alternative monetary and non-monetary valuation systems. Finally, the theoretical framework implies that as part of their discharge of their stewardship function organisations should disclose their environmental performance to stakeholders. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting for natural resources; Environmental accounting; Environmental accounting and reporting; Natural inventories; Theoretical model",

Multiple explanations are offered for this unexpected finding. Instead, existing social relationships moderate the importance of fairness for trust formation. When conducting partnerships with Korean firms, managers should focus more on a quality communication and fair behavior when trust formation is the objective, than on social connections. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Alliances; Korea; Product development; Social ties; Trust formation",

In other words, GDP growth does not predict the long run growth of subjective well-being. In this paper, we argue that there exists a different predictor of subjective well-being that works pretty well: sociability, i. e. the quality and quantity of social relationships (also referred to as relational goods). More precisely, we illustrate the role of sociability as a predictor of well-being, presenting the available evidence at both the within-country and the worldwide level. In particular, we discuss recent evidence from US cross-sectional data (General Social Survey, 1975-2004), cross-country time series (World Value Survey 1980-2005), and German panel data (German Socio-Economic Panel, 1996-2007).

However, this position is being shaken due to the increasingly rising costs in China in pace with China's rapid economic development. China's New Labour Contract Law which took effect from 1 January 2008 has further pushed the labour costs in China in general. The purpose of this article is to arrive at an in-depth understanding of why foreign firms conduct sourcing in China where sourcing is becoming increasingly expensive. The experiences of four Swedish companies in the textile and clothing industry (TCI) conducting sourcing in China are presented. Our findings show that sourcing in China is becoming both cost- and strategy-driven. Companies purely chasing the cheapest production would most probably consider leaving China, whereas companies with a long-term strategic intent and a high level of business ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices will retain all or most of their sourcing activities on the Chinese soil despite the rising costs. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","China; CSR; manufacturing; price; sourcing; Swedish companies; textile and clothing industry (TCI)",

This intentions-behaviour gap is important to researchers and industry, yet poorly understood (Belk et al.: 2005, Consumption, Markets and Culture 8(3), 275-289). In order to push the understanding of ethical consumption forward, we draw on what is known about the intention-behaviour gap from the social psychology and consumer behaviour literatures and apply these insights to ethical consumerism. We bring together three separate insights - implementation intentions (Gollwitzer: 1999, American Psychologist 54(7), 493-503), actual behavioural control (ABC) (Ajzen and Madden: 1986, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 22, 453-474; Sheeran et al.: 2003, Journal of Social Psychology, 42, 393-410) and situational context (SC) (Belk: 1975, Journal of Consumer Research2, 157-164) - to construct an integrated, holistic conceptual model of the intention-behaviour gap of ethically minded consumers. This holistic conceptual model addresses significant limitations within the ethical consumerism literature, and moves the understanding of ethical consumer behaviour forward. Further, the operationalisation of this model offers insight and strategic direction for marketing managers attempting to bridge the intention-behaviour gap of the ethically minded consumer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","actual behavioural control; consumer ethics; ethical consumerism; implementation intentions; intention-behaviour gap; perceived behavioural control; situational context; theory of planned behaviour; word-deed gap",

Particular attention is given to the postructuralist 'aesthetic return': the resurgence of interest in aesthetics as an ontological foundation for human being-in-the-world. The disordered individual-as-emergent-artist-and-artifact, who is at the centre of this 'aesthetic return', is then translated into the 'dis'-organization that is the firm. The firm is thus defined in terms of its primal sensory impact on the world. It invokes a myriad of aesthetic relations between its disorganized self and others: its essence resides within these relations; its power of being is determined by its ability to project a unified aesthetic ideal - a 'mirror fantasy'. The firm thus emerges as a style: where style is defined as an organizing - a sculpting - of aesthetic chaos. In order to achieve a grand style, the firm projects itself through time as a unified aesthetic ideal; as an ongoing work of art. The article concludes with a discussion of how this aesthetic theory of the firm relates to other accepted theories of the nature and purpose of business organizations. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Aesthetics; Postructural ethics; Style; Theory of the firm",

The objective is to determine which moral theories form the basis for CSR policies. Are they based on ethical egoism, libertarianism, utilitarianism or some kind of common-sense morality? In order to address this issue, I conducted an empirical investigation examining the relation between moral theories and CSR policies, in companies engaged in CSR. Based on the empirical data I collected, I start by suggesting some normative arguments used by the respondents. Secondly, I suggest that these moral arguments implicitly rely on some specific moral principles, which I characterise. Thirdly, on the basis of these moral principles, I suggest the moral theories upon which the CSR policies are built. Previous empirical studies examining the relation between philosophical moral theories and the ethical content of business activities have mainly concentrated on the ethical decision-making of managers. Some of the most prominent investigations in that regard propose that managers mainly act in accordance with utilitarian moral theory (Fritzsche, D. J. and H. Becker: 1984, Academy of Management Journal 27(1), 166-175; Premeaux, S. and W. Mony: 1993, Journal of Business Ethics 12, 349-357; Premeaux, S.: 2004, Journal of Business Ethics 52, 269-278).

Applying a methodology grounded in Socratic skepticism, Cicero synthesizes the Stoics and Aristotle to create his own moral theory. From this theory, we derive a Ciceronian set of recommended traits that make up a model business leader. Central to this model is the recognition that there are two lodestars in life, the beneficial and the honorable. The first directs each of us to attend to our personal happiness, and the second to our moral worth. In Cicero's view, the life of leading sizable associations is what best satisfies this dual imperative. The honor of a business leader is secured by the practice of four virtues: wisdom, justice, greatness of spirit, and seemliness. A leader properly seeks his/her own benefit by recognizing that success comes from the relationships he/she establishes and that he/she are more apt to cultivate these by being virtuous. Cicero is not so naïve as to fail to see that the beneficial and the honorable may come into tension, noting various examples from business to illustrate the dilemma. But he insists a businessperson can be ethical and prosper at the same time once he/she comprehends the social fellowship of humanity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","ancients; Aristotle; business ethics; Cicero; happiness; leadership; Stoics; virtue ethics",

The conclusion made is that not only do the demoralizing processes systematically produce moral distance between humans, which weakens individual spontaneous outbursts of sympathy to take increased moral responsibility, they also promise to release individuals from their moral ambivalence by declaring organised action morally indifferent.

Some support is provided to show that codes of ethics are developing in some of Sweden's largest private and public sector organizations - although this is happening to a lesser extent in the public sector. It is noted that an effect of a code of ethics on the bottom line of the business was acknowledged by respondents in both private and public sector organizations.

Firstly, we argue that narrowing down the complexity of ecosystems to a single service has serious technical difficulties and ethical implications on the way we relate to and perceive nature. Secondly, the commodification of ecosystem services denies the multiplicity of values which can be attributed to these services, since it requires that a single exchange-value is adopted for trading.

The reasons underlying the decision by management teams to engage in ethical communication are scarcely focussed on. Thus, grounded on legitimacy and stakeholder theory, this study analyses the views management teams in large listed companies have on communication of CSR. The focus is on aspects on interest, motives/reasons, users and problems related to corporate communication of CSR information. A questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews confirm that there is a distinct trend shift towards more focus on CSR in corporate communication. Whilst this trend shift started as a reactive approach initiated by the many corporate scandals, the trend shift is now argued to be of a proactive nature focussed at preventing legitimacy concerns to arise. These findings are significant and interesting, implying that we are witnessing a transit period between two legitimacy strategies. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the way respondents argue when it comes to CSR activities coincides with consequentialism or utilitarianism, i. e. companies engage in CSR activities to avoid negative impacts instead of being driven by a will to make a social betterment or acting in accordance with what is fundamentally believed to be right to do. This provides new input to the ongoing debate about business ethics. The findings should alert national and international policy makers to the need both to increase the vigilance and capacity of the regulatory and judicial systems in the CSR context and to increase institutional pressure to enhance CSR adoption and CSR communication. Furthermore, stakeholders need to be careful in assuming that CSR communication is an evidence of a CSR commitment influencing corporate behaviour and increasing business ethics. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate social responsibility; CSR communication; legitimacy; stakeholders; utilitarianism",

Content analysis yielded categories that correspond with categories of moral reasoning described in Kohlberg's (1969, Handbook of Socialization Theory and Research, Rand McNally, Chicago, pp. 347-480) model. As hypothesised, it was found that harsher ethical evaluations of guanxi-related behaviours were positively correlated with the stage of moral reasoning.

Little prior research examines this issue and the results are mixed. This paper is motivated by the lack of research on the impact of certified public accountings (CPAs) employment with former audit clients on auditor independence, particularly in the Asia Pacific region in the post-Enron climate. Design/methodology/approach: This research is the first study of its type in the literature using both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The framework of the study is formed by the identification of gaps in the literature and semi-structured interviews. Two within-subjects independent variables - ""auditors of different ranks"" (rank factor) and ""former auditor's direct prior professional relationship with the client"" - and one between-subject independent variable - ""Big 4"" CPAs vs non-Big 4 CPAs - are examined. Mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) are employed to analyze survey responses from 205 ""Big 4"" and 196 ""non-Big 4"" auditors. Findings: The rank factor has a significant influence on the perceptions of auditor independence. Perceived independence is impaired when a senior level professional such as partner or manager joins a former audit client, and revokes an US study conducted in the pre-Enron. Perceived independence is also impaired when the former auditor has a direct prior professional relationship with the former audit client. Results further indicate that when the former manager who has direct prior professional relationship with the client and then joins the audit client, independence is severely impaired. Originality/value: The results of this paper could help to establish an effective standard that deals with the employment/independence situations in the local auditing environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Auditing; Auditors; Business ethics; Employment; Hong Kong",

We have therefore investigated the relationship between the valuation of Euro corporate bonds and the standards of CSR of mainly European companies for the first time in this article. Generally, the debt market exhibits a considerable weight for corporate finance, for which reason creditors should basically play a significant role in the transmission of CSR into the valuation of financial instruments. Given that socially responsible firms are often regarded as economically more successful and less risky, they should have lower risk premia. The results of the empirical analysis, however, reveal that based on an extensive data panel the risk premium for socially responsible firms - according to the classification by SAM Group - was ceterius paribus higher than for non-socially responsible companies. However, only one case of the models investigated was weakly significant. Thus, largely the relationship has to be classified as marginal; so CSR has apparently not yet been incorporated into the pricing of corporate bonds. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate bond evaluation; corporate citizenship; corporate social responsibility; credit spreads; social performance; sustainability; triple bottom line",

This article explores the conceptual differences between silent complicity in particular and other, more ""conventional"" forms of complicity. Despite their far-reaching normative implications, these differences are often overlooked. Rather than being connected to specific actions as is the case for other forms of complicity, the concept of silent complicity is tied to the identity, or the moral stature of the accomplice. More specifically, it helps us expose multinational corporations in positions of political authority. Political authority breeds political responsibility. Thus, corporate responsibility in regard to human rights may go beyond ""doing no harm"" and include a positive obligation to protect. Making sense of this duty leads to a discussion of the scope and limits of legitimate human rights advocacy by corporations. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business and Human Rights; complicity; corporate social responsibility; duty to protect; human rights; human rights advocacy; silent complicity",

Such CEOs project themselves as the corporation they lead, construct a narrative about the corporation and themselves using financial accounting measures, and then reflect on how their accounting-constructed performance is perceived by stakeholders. We do not present empirical evidence about whether the use of accounting language and measures leads to unethical behaviour by extreme narcissistic CEOs - although the conclusions of Duchon and Drake (2009) suggest empirical support is probable.

The empirical investigation sought to determine if personal-related factors significantly influenced travel policy compliance and from the study it could be concluded that there is a correlation, with certain factors exhibiting a stronger correlation than others.

Stakeholders trust the organization to return benefit or protections from harm commensurate with their contributions or stakes. However, in many situations, the firm holds greater power than the stakeholder and therefore cannot necessarily be trusted to return the aforementioned duty to the stakeholder. Stakeholders must therefore rely on the trustworthiness of the organization to fulfill obligations in accordance to Phillips' principle of fairness (Business Ethics Quarterly 7(1), 1997, 51-66), particularly where low-power stakeholders may not be fully consenting (Van Buren III, Business Ethics Quarterly 11(3), 2001, 481-499).

This theme is particularly relevant given the large number of firms that are family-owned. Also the implicit potential of innovation to reconcile corporate sustainability aspects with profitability justifies an extended analysis of this link. Governments often support socially beneficial innovation with various policy instruments, with the intention of increasing international competitiveness and simultaneously supporting sustainable development. In parallel, firms pursue corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental management activities partly in the hope that this will foster such innovation in their organisation (alongside their main aim of improving CSP). Hence, the main research question of this article is about the association of CSP with innovation with high social benefits and the determinants of the potential moderation of this association. Based on panel data, the article analyses the link between CSP and innovation, and the effect of being a family firm using panel estimation techniques. The results point to a moderating role of family firms on the link between innovation with high social benefits and CSP.

First, the purpose of business in society is value creation. Companies have a social mandate to organize mutually advantageous cooperation. Second, business ethics should teach the management competencies necessary to fulfill business's societal mandate. These competencies are optimization competence in the basic game of value creation, governance competence in the meta game of (political) rule setting, and the three discourse-related skills of orientation competence, reception competence, and communication competence necessary for engaging in the meta-meta game. Third, companies can help solve global problems through global corporate citizenship if they participate as political and moral actors in rule-setting processes and rule-finding discourse aimed at laying the foundation for value creation on a global scale. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Management education; New governance; Ordonomics; Social dilemmas; Social entrepreneurship; Stakeholder theory",

Hahn's work is among the growing field of research in comparative business ethics including the global business ethics index (Michalos, 2008, Journal of Business Ethics 79(1), 9-19; Scholtens and Dam, 2008, Journal of Business Ethics 75(3), 273-284; Tsalikis and Seaton, 2008, Journal of Business Ethics 75(3), 229-238). This article is complementary to Hahn's work and it advocates an urgent need for business ethics researchers to globally integrate the bottom-of-the-pyramid countries through a fundamental re-definition of the global economic triad, including the United States, Western Europe, and Japan [Ohmae, 1985, Triad Power: The Coming Shape of Global Competition (New York: Free Press)]. The definition that we propose is based on business systems and institutional perspectives that include the bottom-of-the-pyramid countries. We also propose to broaden the research in business ethics to enable comparisons across business systems indifferent income levels. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bottom of pyramid; Business systems; Developing economies; Ethics; Global triad; Institutions",

Agreeing with Hsieh's recent contribution, this article argues that they do. However, contrary to Hsieh, it holds that such a claim cannot be advanced convincingly only by reference to the negative duty to do no harm. Instead, such a duty necessarily must be grounded in positive obligation. In the search of a foundation for a positive duty for corporations to further just institutions, Stephen Kobrin's notion of ""private political authority"" offers a promising connecting point. Political authority implies political responsibility; Political obligation, however, includes more than merely not doing any harm it is essentially positive obligation. The implications of the new political responsibilities of multinational corporations may even go far beyond the particular duty to promote just institutions; they may be symptomatic for a much more profound shift from an individual to a collective age. © 2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

This article examines the recent history of UN initiatives regarding business and human rights and places the tripartite framework in historical context. Three approaches to human rights are distinguished: moral, political, and legal. It is argued that the tripartite framework's grounding of the responsibility of TNCs to respect human rights is properly understood as moral and not merely as a political or legal duty. A moral account of the duty of TNCs to respect basic human rights is defended and contrasted with a merely strategic approach. The main conclusion of the article is that only a moral account of the basic human rights duties of TNCs provides a sufficiently deep justification of ""the corporate responsibility to respect human rights"" feature of the tripartite framework. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

It is perhaps not surprising that a theory as popular as stakeholder theory should be used in different ways, but when the disparity between different uses becomes too great, it is questionable whether all the 'stakeholder research' refers to the same underlying theory. This paper starts to clarify this definitional confusion by distinguishing between three different ways in which different lines of stakeholder research are connected with descriptive and instrumental stakeholder theory. First, a distinction is made between research connected with descriptive and with instrumental stakeholder theory as defined by Donaldson &Preston in the narrow or broad sense. Second, a distinction is made between research that interprets descriptive and instrumental stakeholder theories as either hypotheses or research areas. Third, a distinction is made between research that interprets Donaldson &Preston's central concept of 'stakeholder management' as either behaviour or rationale. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these differences for empirical research into stakeholder theory. © 2009 The Authors.",,

In this essay we make a modest attempt at establishing further connectivity by surveying the terrain covered by the two disciplines jointly, as if the boundaries between them did not matter. We commence by providing a concise overview of the organization theory discipline for interested non-specialists from the field of business ethics. Next, we proceed to point out four research themes commonly investigated by members of both communities, and also a variety of organization-theoretical perspectives on each. In the final part of this essay we explore what organization theory has to offer business ethics, and what the boundaries of that potential contribution are. We warn skeptical readers in advance that the spirit and tone of our essay is most definitely upbeat, as we are convinced that the potential for symbiosis between the two fields is vast and inspiring, even though it has only been unleashed partially and incidentally thus far. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Questions about the moral justifiability of the capitalist system, the basis of property rights, and the problem of inequality in the distribution of income have been of central importance in both fields. However, political philosophers have developed, especially over the past four decades, a set of tools and concepts for addressing these questions that are in many ways quite distinctive. Most business ethicists, on the other hand, consider their field to be primarily a domain of applied ethics, and so adopt methods and conceptual frameworks developed by moral philosophers. In this paper, we discuss some of the salient differences between these two approaches, and suggest some ways in which business ethicists could benefit from taking a more ""political philosophy"" approach to these questions.

As much as the question appears culturally neutral, many who ask it do so with a culturally-specific lens shaped by prevailing conditions of Western economic strength. However, the dominant economic powers of the future are not likely to be the same North American and Western European markets that have reigned supreme in the recent past.

There has been active research in the well-being of nations across the globe in the last two decades, resulting in substantial theoretical progress and a wealth of empirical data on the well-beings of different nations across the globe. Dissatisfied with the conventional measures such as the GDP, well-being researchers have been developing alternative measures that can better capture the true nature of the well-being of a country. The paper begins by examining why the GDP is inadequate as a good measure of the well-being of a country. Major alternative proposals on well-being or similar measures are summarized. Objective well-being of a nation refers to the conditions of well-being of a country. Subjective well-being of a nation is the perceptions of its citizens with regard to their satisfaction with the major conditions of living in that nation. The paper presents two central arguments leading to the conclusion that business ethics is an integral part of the well-being of a country. The first argument utilizes the concept of workplace well-being to establish the linkage. The second argument uses evidence from a recent survey of the perceptions of Taiwanese people on business ethics in relation to the well-being of a nation.

The traditional ethics of medicine was a teleological ethics predicated on the assumption that the goal of medicine was to prolong life and promote better health. But, as bioethicists have made plain, these are not the only or even the overriding goals of most patients. Most of us have goals and values that limit our desire for medical treatments. Similarly, the view of the stockholder in business ethics is that the stockholder has only one interest - profit. If stockholders have no other values or interests that would limit their desire for additional profit, their sole interest is in profit maximization. But investors are real people with interests and values that balance and limit their desire for profit. It would be an extremely odd individual who cared for nothing except more profit. And institutional investors are supposed to serve the interests of individual investors. Stockholders hold many stakes in the firms in which they invest. The conclusion that most stockholders have interests that would limit the pursuit of maximum profit has significant implications both for business ethics and for the management of for-profit corporations. Something like ""informed consent for investors"" is needed. Corporate managers, to the extent that they are to be agents of their stockholders, must not simply pursue profit maximization. They must ascertain the interests and values of their investors that limit the single-minded pursuit of profit. © Springer 2009.","Bioethics; Corporate management; Informed consent; Stakeholder theory; Stockholder; Stockholder theory; Stockholder values",

Moreover, in testing for moderating relationships, the results indicated that the extent to which taking a business ethics course influenced attitudes varied substantially across individuals.

The article includes the empirical example of US internet technology companies who, in their Chinese operations, face conflicts of norm systems in regard to freedom of expression on the internet.

Design/methodology/approach – The study employs semi-structured interviews with key informants accompanied by site observations. Key informants include chief operating officers, environmental managers and accounting directors of three pulp and paper companies in Thailand. Findings – The study identifies the root causes of the barriers: lack of building organizational learning, a narrow focus on economic performance and absence of guidance on environmental management accounting. Research limitations/implications – As an exploratory case study, findings cannot necessarily be extrapolated to broader populations. To improve the generalization of the findings, future research should broaden the sample. It would also be beneficial to pursue comparative research between industries, countries and regions. Practical implications – Developing environmental management accounting requires increasing “green” knowledge and generating a wider conception of corporate responsibility throughout an organization. In addition, government agencies have to play a significant role in promoting environmental management accounting. Originality/value – This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the influence of organizational learning mechanisms and the role of governments in developing environmental management accounting. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic performance; Environmental management; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Thailand; Workplace training",

I contrast one author's Post-Westphalian political approach to the human rights responsibilities of transnational corporations (TNCs) with my own ""Fair Share"" theory of moral responsibility for human rights. I suggest how the debate about the meaning of corporate human rights ""complicity"" might be informed by the fair share theory. While I point out that Post-Westphalians and moral philosophers may have fundamental disagreements about basic concepts such as legitimacy, justice, and democratic deliberation, I conclude that the Post-Westphalians have made a major contribution to the expansion of the field by presenting business ethicists with an opportunity to inform and guide debates about the potential future course of transnational governance. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Four types of high-leverage finance capitalism are considered: hedge funds; private equityleveraged buyouts; high-leverage, subprime mortgage banking; and high-leverage banking. The structurally related problems with the four types of high-leverage finance capitalism converged in something of a perfect economic storm. Explanations for the crisis are offered in the context of the type of the high-leverage finance capitalism system that permitted and facilitated the economic crisis. Ethics issues and potential reforms are considered that may be able to mitigate the destructive effects of what Schumpeter referred to as the """"creative destructive"" effects of evolutionary forms of capitalism while realizing the Aristotelian economic ideal of creating wealth in such a way as to make us better people and the world a better place. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

While the papers in the 2009 special issue of Business Ethics Quarterly explore the political role of corporations I argue that they lack a sophisticated analysis of power across institutional and actor networks. The argument that corporate engagement with deliberative democracy can enhance the legitimacy of corporations does not take into account the effects of institutional, material and discursive forms of power that determine legitimacy criteria. As a result corporate versions of citizenship mediate versions of social responsibility and morality, which are reflected in the institutional and political economic norms that are produced by this power/knowledge. In order to overcome the limits of corporate social responsibility there is a need to develop more democratic forms of global governance of corporations. A radical revisioning of democratic governance would also need to overcome the limits posed by sovereignty and would require new forms of multi-actor and multi-level translocal governance arrangements in an attempt to create forms of power that are more compatible with the principles of economic democracy. © 2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

However, leaders who displayed increased ethical leadership were no more likely to be viewed as promotable in the near-term compared to those who displayed less ethical leadership.

Marketers have responded mainly by using corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication to counter the critique of CSR practice, but these claims of ethical corporate behavior often lack credibility and can result in a backlash against brands.

We use the method of critical genealogy to demonstrate that the norms that discourage lateral hiring are constructions used by powerful employers to control the turnover of their employees, making them subjects of their employer's power rather than free and autonomous people in their own right. We suggest instead that ethical responsibility for entertaining or rejecting lateral hiring offers rests with the focal employee(s). We conclude that the form and symmetry of loyalty between employees and their current employers are the determinants of the appropriateness of an employee's decision to entertain and accept outside offers.

We found that, compared to benefits, allocating burdens intergenerationally increased concern with one's legacy, heightened ethical concerns, intensified moral emotions (e.g., guilt, shame), and led to feelings of greater responsibility for and affinity with future generations. We argue that, because of greater concern with legacies and the associated moral implications of one's decisions, allocating burdens leads to greater intergenerational generosity as compared to benefits. Our data provide support for this effect across a range of contexts. Our results also indicate that the differential effect of benefits versus burdens in intergenerational contexts depends on the presence of two important structural characteristics that help enact concerns about legacies, including (1) future impact of decisions, and (2) a self-other tradeoff. Overall, our findings highlight how considering resource valence brings to the fore a number of key psychological characteristics of intergenerational decisions-especially as they relate to legacies and ethics. © 2010 Business Ethics Quarterly 20:1 (January 2010); ISSN 1052-150X.",,

The result has been a confusing mix of standards and their defenses. Thus, there is widespread recognition that business requires a common framework to provide ethical guidance. One of the most prominent conceptual frameworks recently offered, which addresses issues of international business ethics, is that of integrative social contracts theory (ISCT) developed by Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee. By integrating normative and empirical matters, and drawing on the concepts of social contracts and hypernorms, ISCT seeks to provide a workable, comprehensive theory of business ethics. In this article I argue that, in fact, ISCT offers two different views of hypernorms and the theoretical structure surrounding them. A Principlist View that understands hypernorms as the most general, universal moral principles that hold moral sway over all microsocial contracts. A Contextualist View is that hypernorms are not special, additional norms, but refer to a certain status that the most general norms or principles of each community achieve that are part of a convergence with the norms of other societies. I maintain that the Contextualist View offers a plausible view of ISCT while avoiding many of the criticisms that have been made against the Principlist interpretation of ISCT. Further, the Contextualist View suggests other areas in which ISCT needs further development, such as in the area of human rights which I also briefly explore. © Springer 2009.","Donaldson; Dunfee; Human rights; Hypernorms; Integrative social contracts theory; Moral free space; Social contract; Stakeholder theory",

Philosophically, anglo-american culture may be described as individualistic, legalistic, pragmatist and with an understanding of rights as freedom from state intervention. Continental European culture, on the other hand, is more community-oriented, more dependent on unwritten laws or customs, less resultsdriven or more appreciative of the intrinsic value of activities and with an understanding of rights as freedom to participate in social goods and decisions.

Adam Smith has been brought into the discipline to show that his authority cannot be summoned to fully support the free market sceptics of business ethics. Little has been done, however, to illustrate that Smith's moral writings actually contain the fundamentals of a business ethics teaching for managers who necessarily work within a variety of networks. This article analyses his moral thought to infer a Smithean framework of business ethics for managers. Smith believes that self-interest should be subordinated to moral imperatives, even in the business world. However, Smith rejects the principles of corporate social responsibility on the argument that benevolent impulses cannot be expected to prevail in the commercial arena. Instead of consciously trying to advance the social good, Smith's ideal manager will endeavour to personally live up to the standards enforced by an impartial spectator of his conduct, a theoretical entity reflecting the ethical requirements posed by the manager's social networks and stakeholder relationships. While this internalized onlooker expects a limited degree of benevolence, the overriding demand is for the manager to abide by the dictums of justice and prudence. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adam Smith; business ethics; corporate social responsibility; network ethics; self-interest; social networks; virtue",

Ethical behavior offers good reputation, credibility and tradition to the corporation. It leads to corporate social, environmental and economic responsibilities, cooperating to the desired sustainability. This paper analyzes the inversion of values that corporate governance systems have suffered. The meaning and implication of the corporate social responsibility is investigated and discussed. A pyramid of values is built upon individual ethical values at the basis. Over them, the organizational ethical values should indicate the limits of operations, so that the corporate social responsibility can be sustained, in the top. The authors comment that ethical values no longer lead the organization. Its communication with the stakeholders, specifically through reports, has been gradually replacing the code of ethics and corporate values. These reports have taken the basis of the pyramid leading the organizations to socially irresponsible and unethical behavior. They do not guarantee transparency or communicate the needs of the society. It appears that transnational companies do not behave the same way in their home country as they do in host countries, particularly in less developed regions like Latin America and Africa. Lack of communication and transparency may induce employees to unethical decisions and transform the reporting system into a marketing instrument. In order to guarantee compliance with the codes, transparency and ethical responsibility, communication within the organization is essential. © Springer 2010.","Business ethics; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability; Transnational corporations; Transparency",

We argue that one way to reach that goal is for business to provide what we denote as complementary alternative benefits (CABs), to its workforce. In this article, we advocate for businesses to offer CABs which focus on sustaining the health, reducing the stress, and improving the camaraderie of its workforce. We argue that business can use these benefits to promote a healthy, less-stressed, and collegial workforce that is less prone to resolve conflicts by violence. Further, we examine the role business plays in promoting more peaceful societies and how employer-initiated stress reduction programs are consistent with both business ethics and peace-building principles. Finally, using case studies we demonstrate how CABs may also reduce costs related to absenteeism and turnover, and thus improve the bottom line. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Business and society; Business ethics; Community; Complementary alternative benefits; Employee benefits; Peace building; Peace Through Commerce; Workplace stress",

With learning objectives designed precisely to measure the student delta based on content, process and engagement in a particular class, those programs that have opted for stand-alone ethics courses may be (though not necessarily are) more prepared to respond to assessment-related inquiries regarding their programs or satisfaction of the standards. The relevance of the AACSB standards modification to the current efforts at ethics integration in business programs is instead a re-examination of how to create a program of integration that is designed to ensure the most effective learning results possible, while responding to the challenges presented by the integrated approach. The purpose of this article is to explore some of those challenges that may be somewhat universal to business school programs implementing the integrated approach, and to share one large university's response to those challenges, along with lessons learned. © Springer 2010.","Aacsb; Assessment; Business schools; Ethical decision-making; Ethics curricula; Ethics integration; Ethics modules; Leadership",

This essay argues that such an ahistorical approach to ethics should be supplemented by a due regard for history. Invoking precedents by authors such as Jonsen and Toulmin, McIntyre, Niebuhr, Weber, De Tocqueville, Machiavelli and others, this essay explores several important ways in which a due regard for history can and should shape the practice of business ethics. Thus a due regard for history helps us both to cultivate fitting appreciation of cultural mores and to understand how current problems and issues have developed as they have; it helps us to gauge current responsibilities with respect legacies of problems inherited from the past; it helps us to develop a lively sense of what is possible in the present, given current contingencies and past experiences; and it moves us to rethink the practice of ethical auditing: not just as a backward-looking effort to gauge compliance but as a forward-looking way of learning from actual experiences and developing fitting responses. © Springer 2010.","Contingencies; Conventions; Ethics; Historical possibilities; History; Legacies",

However, reports of the corrupt practices of both governments and businesses have plagued international peace building efforts, deepening the distrust of stricken communities. Businesses are perceived as being selfish and indifferent to the impact their operations may have on the social and political development of local communities. Additionally, the corruption of local governments has been cited as interfering with the creation of stability in conflict areas. Within this framework, multinational Public-Private Partnerships can exert two forms of influence: they can either exacerbate these problems, or they can become part of the solution. Without a relationship of trust among local businesses, government, and the private sector, peace building efforts will at best be mixed, and could possibly perpetuate violence in fragile states. Public and private interests are better served when Public-Private Partnerships are based upon collaboration and assist in establishing principles of good governance in conflict areas. This in turn can help build trust and regain the credibility of both sectors among local communities, which are essential in making Public-Private Partnerships more effective. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Building peace; Capacity building; Corporate responsibility; Corruption; Ethics; Good governance; Public-private partnership; Rule of law",

The main focus is the social marketing development process undertaken by the Alberta Health Services to plan and implement cancer prevention and cancer screening campaigns. Unique to this process is an internationally recognized panel of social marketing experts to review and provide consultation. Improvements in planning and implementing campaigns are outlined, including stakeholder engagement, use of audiencecentred strategies, and endorsement of campaigns by management. The primary outcome of bringing together a clear and organized social marketing tool for cancer prevention and cancer screening in Alberta is the development, implementation, and evaluation of campaigns that follow a systematic best-practice process.

Broadly interpreted, ""closure"" requires leaving viable ecosystems on mining lands that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities, that have low hazard, and that encompass measures to prevent ongoing pollution from the site in the long-term. Financial assurance encompasses environmental surety instruments that protect the government and public in the event a mining company cannot meet its reclamation or rehabilitation obligations. As such, financial assurance is in essence the money available for closure of the mine in the case when the mine owner is not available to perform the work. A general trend towards greater environmental concern among social stakeholders in mining further serves to focus attention on policies and practices that can actually ""assure"" financial assurance. Financial assurance is also perceived as a means to address closure-related challenges that are increasing in number as well as diversity. Notably, current trends involve a shift towards a greater focus to the societal aspects of mine closure rather than just the ecological. The use of financial assurance, however, also raises some fundamental questions about how assurance mechanisms influence mining operations and the relationship between mining operations and their surroundings. This paper examines both the internal effect of a variety of financial assurance approaches on mining operations-in particular the manner in which environmental and social concerns are addressed by mining firms, and the almost inevitable tension between some form of financial provision for closure on the one hand, and governmental expectations of tax revenue on the other. As a major argument for supporting the conduct of mining is that state revenues from the extractive industries supply monies for the building of human and infrastructural capital, this second area of tension also has strong social and developmental overtones. © 2009.","Financial assurance; Mine closure; Stakeholder management","Current trends; Environmental concerns; Extractive industry; Financial assurance; General trends; Human activities; Internal effects; Mine closure; Mine closures; Mining companies; Mining operations; Social concerns; Stakeholder management; Tax revenue; Mines; Mining; Plant shutdowns; Finance; closure; financial policy; financial system; mining; mining industry; stakeholder"

While SIEs form a major part of the informal workforce in developing countries and contribute significantly to economic growth, their potential is being undermined when they engage in irresponsible and deceptive business practices such as overpricing, sale of underweight or substandard products, or attempts to hoard goods, to name a few. Despite the growing interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives of small businesses in developing countries, the SIEs have received almost no attention. To address this void in the literature, we explore the reasons for the less than optimal level of social responsibility demonstrated by some SIEs in developing countries.We do so by drawing upon the existing literature to develop a comprehensive framework of social responsibility of SIEs highlighting their unique characteristics and the different contextual factors that they encounter in developing countries. Based on this framework, we then present a set of propositions specifying the influence of these contextual factors such as business environment, cultural traditions, socio-economic conditions, and both international and domestic pressures on the business practices of SIEs. The framework offers an explanation for the lack of responsible entrepreneurship of SIEs and has important implications for promoting sustainable business practices in developing countries where businesses are striving hard to survive and compete. © Springer 2009.","Developing countries; Responsible entrepreneurship; Small-scale individual entrepreneurs; Social responsibility",

Broadly, management will not be organised within the framework of a well-established profession unless formal knowledge, licensing, professional autonomy and professional codes of conduct are developed sufficiently. In developing business management as a profession, law may play a key role. Where the idea is that business management should be more professsionalised, managers must show that they are willing to adopt ethical values, while arriving at business decisions. The paper argues that ethics cannot survive without legal regulation, which, in turn, will not be supported by law unless lawyers can find alternative solutions to the large mechanisms of the official society, secured by the monopolised coercion of the nation state. From a micro perspective of law and business ethics, communities can be developed with their own conventions, rules and standards that are generated and sanctioned within the boundaries of the communities themselves. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Business management as a profession; Contents and nature of management activities; Formal knowledge; Licensing; Professional autonomy; Professional codes of conduct; Viable morality and its legal component",

Potential SME benefits and firm and sector-specific strategies drive the adoption and use of ICT. Furthermore, sectors are increasingly global and dominated by large firms and the structure of their values chains and operations shape opportunities for SMEs. Principal reasons for non-adoption are lack of applicability and little incentive to change business models when returns are unclear. SMEs also face generic barriers to adoption including trust and transaction security and IPR concerns, and challenges in areas of management skills, technological capabilities, productivity and competitiveness. The issues for governments throughout the European Union (EU) are to foster appropriate business environments for eBusiness and ICT uptake, and target programs to overcome market failures to the extent that they are needed in particular areas (e.g. skill formation, specialized information). Governments have a range of SME eBusiness and internet use programs. However, commercial considerations and potential returns are the principal drivers of SME adoption and profitable use. The key drivers for enabling eBusiness development are commitment and support of industry associations, in particular in sectoral initiatives, synergies by having access to resources from other initiatives or organizations, competitive pressure and ease of participation. The key barriers slowing ICT adoption are competition among companies in the target group, Lack of awareness, often combined with mistrust regarding ICT and ICT service providers, costs, lack of internal ICT and management knowledge, Network infrastructure issues: access and interoperability, Legal uncertainties. The European Commission has identified 3 factors that make it difficult for SMEs, in particular, to engage more fully with ICT and develop sustainable business practices: 1) the relatively high costs associated with investments in ICT; 2) the lack of technical and managerial skills and; 3) reluctance on the part of SMEs to network with other enterprises. The proposed framework summarizes the main policy directions derived from the analysis and the key areas of eBusiness support - Business environment, Skills upgrading, Network infrastructure, Trust infrastructure, Digital products and information services, Intangible investments and assets, Information, Government on-line. Finally the paper maps proposed key eBusiness support areas around key dimensions of eBusiness (functional, sectoral, and regional/spatial) on three distinct levels (micro: the level of the firm, meso: the level of the region, and macro: national/international).","Ebusiness; Ict impact; Smes; Support policy framework",

On the other hand, Thai and American businesspeople perceived ethics to be more important for business success than Turkish businesspeople. The understanding of the differences and similarities in ethical perceptions of the businesspeople from various countries is valuable for a successful and harmonious working together when engaging in global marketing activities. This study is thus believed to be useful for people who plan to invest or manage businesses in these countries, and many of the implications are thought to be valuable in international business arena. © Springer 2010.","Businesspeople; Crosscultural comparison; Ethics; Marketing",

The issues that have received most attention are whether executives' pay is fair and justified by performance. Since more recent studies show that stock options grants constitute the single largest component in executive compensation, we examine the relations of these grants to economic determinants and corporate governance for firms in the stagnant stage of their lifecycle. We find that, on average, stock options grants comprise a significant portion of annual CEO compensation (26.4%) for stagnant firms. We also find that economic (corporate governance) factors explain less (or more) of the cross-sectional variation in stock options grants for stagnant firms than for growth firms. Furthermore, we document lower pay-performance sensitivity (i.e., weaker incentive alignment) and no improvement in future firm performance from past stock options grants to CEOs of stagnant firms. In particular, our study provides empirical evidence on some inefficiencies associated with stock options grants to CEOs of low potential (stagnant) firms, a long-standing concern of business ethics researchers (Moriarty, 2005; Nichols and Subramaniam, 2001; Perel, 2003). Our results also provide support for the corporate governance reforms discussed in Matsumura and Shin (2005), especially those proposed provisions that curtail the power of CEOs in the governance of firms. © Springer 2009.","Business ethics; Economic determinants; Executive compensation; Life cycle; Payperformance sensitivity; Stock options",

In this way, negative externalities are revealed upon the regional economic performance.

This study develops a theoretical framework that predicts (1) the impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on firm-idiosyncratic risk and (2) the role of two strategic marketing levers, advertising and research and development (R&D), in explaining the variability of this impact among different firms. The results show that higher CSP lowers undesirable firm-idiosyncratic risk. Notably, although the salutary impact of CSP is greater in firms with higher (versus lower) advertising, a simultaneous pursuit for CSP, advertising, and R&D is harmful with increased firm-idiosyncratic risk. For theory, the authors advance the literature on the marketing-finance interface by drawing attention to the risk-reduction potential of CSP and by shedding new light on some critical but neglected roles of strategic marketing levers. They also extend CSP research by moving away from the long-fought battle for a universal CSP impact and toward a finer-grained understanding of when some firms derive more risk-reduction benefits from CSP. For practice, the results indicate that the ""goodwill refund"" of CSP is not unconditional. They also empower marketers to communicate more effectively with investors (i.e., doing good to better manage the risk surrounding firm stock prices). © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Advertising; Corporate social responsibility; Marketing-finance interface; Research and development; Stock risk",

These metrics do not provide the necessary level of detail for managers who want to establish an optimal level of CSP investment for their company. Further, academic research has tended to overlook the mediation process between CSP and financial performance.

Two data sources are used to consider whether alcohol is enjoyed responsibly in Australia by informed adults. First, 582 surveys were analysed to consider whether respondents were adequately informed about alcohol. Second, covert observations were used to record what people actually drink to understand whether alcohol is always enjoyed responsibly. Taken together, the results suggest many adults are not adequately informed and many Australian adults do not enjoy alcohol responsibly. A more rigorous social responsibility approach may be warranted. To achieve sustained behavioural change companies need to move towards corporate social performance (CSP). CSP requires CSR interventions to be evaluated to determine their contribution towards real social gains. CSR is not enough to reach the social goals required by society. The concept of CSP takes away the lip service around CSR by requiring companies to document sustained behavioural change. © 2009 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.","Alcohol; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Observations; Social change",

We think that distributive justice, that is the way in which firms involve their stakeholders in their wealth creation and dissemination processes, provides a comprehensive understanding of corporate responsibilities. Concerning procedural justice, we will discuss how firms involve stakeholders in their strategic processes according to their contribution to wealth creation.

In theory, outside directors are in a better position than insiders to protect and further the interests of all stakeholders because of their experience and their sense of moral and legal obligations. Female directors also tend to be more sensitive to ethics according to several past studies which explain this affirmation by early gender socialization, the fact that women are thought to place a greater emphasis on harmonious relations and the fact that men and women use different ethical frameworks in their judgments. The goal of this paper is to determine the influence of these characteristics of the Board in terms of promoting and hindering the creation of a code of ethics. Our findings show that a greater number of female directors does not necessarily lead to more ethical companies. Moreover, within Europe as a continent, board ownership leads to an entrenchment of upper-level management, generating a divergence between the ethical interests of owners and managers. In light of this situation, the presence of independent directors is necessary to reduce such conflicts. © Springer 2009.","Board of Directors; Business ethics; Codes of ethics; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility",

This research examines the effects of communication strategies a firm can use to mitigate the impact of these inconsistencies on consumer perceptions of corporate hypocrisy and subsequent beliefs about the firm's social responsibility and attitudes toward the firm. Study 1 indicates that a proactive communication strategy (when the firm's CSR statements precede conflicting observed behavior) leads to higher levels of perceived hypocrisy than a reactive strategy (when the firm's CSR statements follow observed behavior). The inconsistent information in both scenarios increases perceptions of hypocrisy, such that CSR statements can actually be counterproductive. Study 1 also reveals how perceived hypocrisy damages consumers' attitudes toward firms by negatively affecting CSR beliefs and provides evidence for the mediating role of hypocrisy during information processing. Study 2 finds that varying CSR policy statement abstractness acts to reduce the hidden risk of proactive communication strategies and can improve the effectiveness of a reactive strategy.

As a consequence of this critique, the concept of a practice-based 'ethics of responsiveness' in which ethics is never final but rather always 'to come', is investigated. In such an approach the ethical self is understood as being continuously constituted within power/knowledge relations.

Stakeholder approach in the organization integrates stakeholder relationships within a company's resource base, industry setting, and sociopolitical arena into a single analytical framework. The key relationships for a business go far beyond the relationships with its customers and include the relationships with its employees, as well as those with suppliers and partners, investors and market analysts, and even government regulators, trade associations and other entities that influence the general business climate in which a given business operates. In all cases stakeholders are inseparable part of management strategy. This concept helps people and organizations to agree upon joint goals, participation, boundaries and benefit, i.e. flexibly to plan the activity. Organizations generate intellectual, environmental, and social capital in addition to financial capital. In successful organizations, the three core elements of strategy, structure, and culture are aligned and respond to external forces and changing expectations. The relationships among core elements are dynamic and adaptive, both in relation to each other and in relation to the overall fit between the organization and its environment. A comprehensive orientation toward stakeholder management penetrates the core of the organization; in the redefined organization, all the three elements and their alignment reflects the underlying humanistic commitment to the organization's stakeholders. A clear demonstration that management possesses and intends to implement a compelling vision of the enterprise - who we are, and what we stand for - provides the essential foundation for effective stakeholder management. Organization-stakeholder relations lead to new ideas about the responsibilities of organizations, the role of managers, and the most appropriate management style. Seeing organizations and their relationship with stakeholders from a systems perspective helps us understand that organizations, as organic systems, undergo self- regulation and renewal through interactions with diverse parts of their environment. The more dynamic view of organization-stakeholder relations acknowledges the interdependence that exists between companies and their stakeholders and asserts that stakeholder relationships can be a source of opportunity and competitive advantage rather than simply threat or drain on organizational resources. However, for most companies, the attention of management has been focused on one stakeholder group at a time. Collaborative approaches are often confined to specific parts of an organization. Rare is the company that adopts a comprehensive and strategic approach to relationship building that is governed both by deep social values and by recognition of the bottom line.","Balanced scorecard; Intangible assets; Organization competitiveness; Organization's wealth; Stakeholder relationships",

Some Brazilian stockholders have become aware of the risks involved in unethical procedures and are adopting the Best Practices of Corporate Governance initiative. International agencies have intensively supported organizations and governments in an effort to define policies that inhibit illegal or corrupt cultural habits throughout the world, but Brazilian practitioners show insufficient response. Skepticism may indicate a lack of understanding about how an ethical leadership can guide employees, setting high standards for the organizational culture and climate, clearly defining limits of correct behavior, and creating appropriate codes of ethics.

Design/methodology/approach: CSP is a function of qualitative measures of a firm's Board of Directors, as well as firm risk and financial performance. A longitudinal sample of 104 Canadian firms is used. Findings: Board independence is positively related to social performance but shareholder orientation is not. In addition, a positive relationship between social performance with both financial performance and debt is found. Research limitations/implications: Although the sample is small and restricted to Canadian firms, the results are quite robust. Future studies should consider using qualitative measures on a larger international sample of firms. Originality/value: This paper uses qualitative measures - the degree of independence of the Board and the Board's level of shareholder orientation - to examine the interrelationship between a firm's Board of Directors and its CSP. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Boards of Directors; Canada Paper type Research paper; Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance",

Naturally companies are concerned to protect their investments, and to ensure their viability. They will therefore invest in necessary infrastructure and facilities of all types, where those are lacking. Such investment often provides benefits to the wider community, but with a few exceptions these are normally incidental byproducts rather than inherent objectives. The motivation for companies to provide resources of all types in order to enhance the capabilities of the public sector to provide public services is usually an expectation is that the tangible benefits will exceed the costs, rather than altruism. One driving force is to secure and maintain a company's social licence to operate. More recently competition from Chinese firms is prompting private sector companies to offer comparable investments in infrastructure. It is unclear whether investment in public sector capabilities is cyclical and liable to cutbacks when market conditions deteriorate. Changing market conditions affect not just corporate willingness to spend but also host countries' bargaining strengths. In boom periods host countries will be more able to secure straightforward financial benefits through higher tax receipts than when markets are weak. Beyond the specific needs of individual projects corporate policies are strongly influenced by the beliefs of senior managers. External pressures both from international institutions and from NGOs also drive corporate behaviour. The success of investment in public sector capabilities relies in the end on the responses of host countries, and on how closely the objectives and interests of the government are aligned with maximising the nation's long term wealth and welfare. Where they are not corporate resources may be frittered away. There are also questions over the legitimacy of corporate investments, especially by foreign-owned companies. They have a right to offer advice and protect their legitimate interests, but these may not always coincide with those of their host countries. There is a range of questions about the appropriate role of companies, which lead on to feasible and effective ways of improving weak governance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

And yet it also seems true that moralistic campaigns to achieve the impossible, e.g., pursuing justice for its own sake or eradicating egoism, often ""detract from attaining really important things.""

Using the insights developed by Hirschman, I would like to show how one must first expose the rhetoric of those critics of change (referred to below as conservatives or reactionaries) in order then to implement that which is new (representatives of this approach are referred to below as progressives). Such an 'unmasking' works particularly well when one can defuse the arguments of the reactionaries - which is precisely what one achieves by strategically integrating ethics into economics. In his work The Rhetoric of Reaction Hirschman examines three basic forms of reactionary thought: the perversity thesis, the futility thesis, and the jeopardy thesis. According to the perversity thesis, intended goals are transformed into their opposites. The futility thesis argues that the setting of goals is useless since history runs its own course independent of those goals. The jeopardy thesis claims to preserve what already exists since change might substantially endanger that which has already been achieved. The importance of Hirschman's ideas for the strategic interplay between the academic disciplines can be seen quite clearly in the example of German business ethics. This will be displayed below with reference to Hirschman's three theses. Finally, implications will be drawn for business ethics in general and for management theory in particular. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Albert O.

This focus on virtue establishes a long-range ethics that is based on a principle of justice, demands rational intellectual activity, and carries implications for everyone's self-interest.

A study from the province of Lower Austria in Austria, where organically certified cereals and bread are produced, processed and marketed locally serves to illuminate these issues. The interviewees themselves, their motives and visions, their products and their social relationships with their business partners and customers are the biggest strengths of the local food supply chains studied. These strengths are contrasted by weaknesses in the realm of business management, planning, marketing, product development, logistics and a shortage of skilled staff. The internal strengths and weaknesses found in this study seem to be typical for small, artisan and regionally operating enterprises, whereas the external opportunities and threats appear to be of a less general nature. Opportunities (being held in increasing esteem by urban consumers, exploitation of new distribution channels) as well as threats (a lack of willingness to innovate, a lack of appreciation by rural consumers, a conventionalised organic market, a lack of support by legislation and politics) are strongly related to the local organic market.

Over the year following the announcement, companies in the Top 100 yield negative abnormal returns of around 3%. However, such companies tend to be large and with stocks exhibiting a growth style, which existing studies suggest will tend to perform poorly. Once we allow for these firm characteristics, the poor performance of the highly rated firms declines.

Using the core elements of Confucianism, the article constructs a notion of a Confucian Firm with its concepts of the moral person (Junzi), core human morality (ren, yi, li) and relationships (guanxi), as well as benign social structure (harmony), articulated in corporate and organizational terms. The basic character of the Confucian Firm is described, and its philosophical and cultural foundation is critically assessed with respect to its moral legitimacy and relevant to today's China. China's recent Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) development is a high profile response to global business ethics concerns. Efforts have been made to emulate and develop good business practice fashioned in CSR norms and visions. The so-called ""human-based"" and ""virtue-based"" business practices rooted in local cultural heritage have been touted as a Chinese response to this problem. This investigation is particularly relevant in the context of the increasingly prominence of the Chinese corporations (China Inc.) in the wake of the rise of China as a global power. How relevant is Confucianism to the building of a modern Chinese corporation that is willing and able to practice reasonable norms of business ethics?

They are crucial to expanded development of ethical markets and hence to the addition of moral dimensions to the normally amoral behaviour linking consumers and retail and production businesses. The study reported here attempts to assess the contribution of UK ethical, social and environmental certification and labelling initiatives to 'sustainable' consumption and production. The research sought to assess the overall potential of initiatives to inject human values into the supply-distribution chains, through a qualitative survey of 15 of the 26 main UK initiatives: in social justice, animal welfare and environmental sustainability from the agriculture, food processing, timber, aquaculture, textiles and personal care sectors. By analysing the basic characteristics and concepts of these labels and investigating the emergence of labelling initiatives, we assess whether labels help add an ethical dimension, or whether, in some respects, they also reduce such missions to the technical management of adding only another 'utility' to a product. The analysis assesses whether the gradual 'mainstreaming' of ethical initiatives such as 'Fairtrade' risks subsuming ethical goals within business participants' competitive and profit-oriented logics. However, the contrasting perspectives revealed between rival labelling initiatives show that the scope and functions of labelling projects go beyond the manifest ones of information communication between consumers and producer and actually introduce elements of socio-political regulation.

After a brief presentation of the main parameters of the framework proposed by the 3rd Report and of its precarious advantage over other similar initiatives, this article takes a close look at the main link that needs to be operationalised: i. e. the link between corporate responsibility for human rights and the concept of legal and criminal responsibility. The article then addresses the constitutive elements of the concept of responsibility to shed light upon the responsibility of business organisations in a human rights law context. It looks at the innovative ways in which the concept of corporate criminal responsibility has been dealt with in various domestic jurisdictions and at the new paradigms of corporate agency resulting in the process. Building on this inquiry, the analysis focusses on the way in which the legal discourse acquires new dimensions of corporate responsibility by moving away from an individualistic perspective.

Adopting a scholarship of integration approach and evaluating the six studies of communities of organizations, we contribute an inter-organizational network model based on the assumptions about human motives and choice offered by Aristotle. We argue that the sustainability of inter-organizational communities depends on how rich is the set of assumptions about human nature upon which they are based. In order to develop and sustain collaborative capabilities in inter-organizational communities, a set of assumptions that takes both self-regarding and others'-regarding preferences as ends is required to avoid any kind of instrumentalization of collaboration, which is an end in itself.

The paper discusses the idea of business leaders acting as agents of world benefit, taking an active co-responsibility in generating solutions to problems. It argues that we need responsible global leaders who are aware of the pressing problems in the world, care for the needs of others, aspire to make this world a better place, and act in word and deed as global and responsible citizens. The argument is structured as follows: first, in highlighting some leadership challenges we discuss why it takes a responsible, global, and ultimately cosmopolitan mindset to enhance human values on a global scale.

The paper proposes an integrated explanation of these two stylised facts by extending the analysis of the relative income explanation of the Easterlin paradox to social relationships as enjoyable ends of choice. Drawing on the evidence-based results of psychology, the paper constructs a model whose premises are (i) that individuals produce social relationships by means of relational ability, (ii) that this ability is primarily shaped during infancy, and (iii) that commercial pressure on children to consume in competition with others may displace the enjoyment of social relationships. The model is thus also able to explain the case of rich countries, like Sweden, that devote relatively more human and material resources than the US to children and adolescents, and that experience both increasing subjective well-being and improving social capital. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: Among all ICCR 2007-2008 shareholder resolutions, the paper analyze unethical practices that could lead to corporate illegalities for business corporations that are included in the portfolios of Christian mutual funds. It will determines to what extent such companies have codes of ethics that clearly explained the expected behaviour from their employees, managers, or directors about given ethical issues: sexual orientation discrimination, conflicts of interest on the board and slave labour in the supply chain. Findings: About the issue of slave labour in the supply chain, managers of Christian mutual funds could not invoke ignorance since in the code of ethics of one company, there is no provision dealing with slave labour. Concerning conflicts of interest on the board, managers of Christian mutual funds could not identify potential risks related to those companies, since the problem is the applicability of their codes of ethics. Finally, companies have very different ways to address or not the issue of sexual orientation discrimination in their codes of ethics. Originality/value: The originality of the paper is twofold: first to compare companies Christian mutual funds are investing in (on the basis of Christian selection criteria) and companies for which there are ICCR resolutions (the aim of such resolutions is to change some questionable or unethical aspect of a given business corporation), and second to see to what extent corporate codes of ethics are written in a way to reduce or increase the potentiality of ethical conflicts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Christianity; Corporate governance; Ethics; Investment funds",

E. Freeman has engrossed much of the business ethics literature. Subsequently, some advocates have moved a bit too quickly and without proper definition or argument. They have exceeded Freeman's intentions which are more libertarian and free-market than is often thought. This essay focuses on the versions of stakeholder theory directly authored or coauthored by Freeman in an effort to recover (1) Freeman's intentions and (2) the argumentative justification of stakeholder theory. It then argues that Freeman's appeal to legal, economic, and ethical constraints ultimately produce arguments that are invalid. One can thoroughly support legislation constraining corporations or seeking to prevent age discrimination, market monopolies, and externalities and regret the extent that capitalism is heir to such shortcomings without it following that (1) business beneficiaries should be changed from stockholders to stakeholders and (2) the latter should be given serious decision-making power. Further, stakeholder theory neither defines nor battles any obvious opposition. Hence, it is difficult to see what it changes about business management. In short, stakeholder theory either changes too much about business, or nothing important at all (depending on one's interpretation).

Many researchers have sought to link high levels of Corporate Responsibility with good Corporate Reputations. Yet, the link between these two concepts is not clear and managers do not have much guidance on how they could embrace Corporate Responsibility to enhance Corporate Reputation. One potential reason for the current confusion is that stakeholders have, for the most part, been considered as being homogenous in terms of their expectations of Corporate Responsibility, which means reputational impact is difficult to define. This paper challenges the notion that Corporate Responsibility is an homogenous construct. A latent class model is used to provide evidence that customers and employees of a financial service organisation can be segmented into three groups. This suggests that these groups have different expectations of Corporate Responsibility and as such positive reputation is likely to be driven by meeting these different sets of expectations. The understanding of how Corporate Responsibility impacts on Corporate Reputation is heightened and further implications for the management of reputation and directions for future research are discussed. © 2009 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.","Corporate Responsibility; Latent class analysis; Reputation Management; Stakeholder segmentation",

Throughout his article, Friedman emphasizes the values of freedom, respect for law, and duty. The principle that a business professional should not infringe upon the liberty of other members of society can be used by business ethicists to ground a vigorous line of ethical analysis. Any practice, which has a negative externality that requires another party to take a significant loss without consent or compensation, can be seen as unethical. With Friedman's framework, we can see how ethics can be seen as arising from the nature of business practice itself.

The most common insurance fraud activity and one that contributes a significant portion of dollar losses is the practice of padding claim amounts in the event of a loss. One of the largest issues insurance companies face is that policyholders often do not perceive insurance claim padding as an unethical behavior. However, very little research has examined the factors that contribute to such perceptions. Considering how consumers often attempt to justify fraudulent behavior from a fairness perspective, the present work examines how the amount of the deductible in an insurance claim situation can influence feelings of fairness and ethicality. The results of an experimental study show that higher deductible amounts result in stronger perceptions that insurance claim padding is fair to the insurance company, weaker perceptions that the behavior is unethical, and higher proposed claim award amounts. The study also shows, however, that the deductible amount effects are attenuated for consumers who display higher ethical standards as reflected by their scores on the consumer ethics scale. Implications are discussed with respect to the insurance industry, deviant consumer behavior, and general business ethics theory. © Springer 2008.","Consumer ethics scale; Deviant consumer behavior; Insurance claim padding; Insurance fraud; Perceived risk",

However, few have actually tried to understand and explain it, and even fewer have discussed whether the opposite - standardisation - is possible and desirable. In this article, we take a broader perspective on the issue of the heterogeneity of SRI. We distinguish between four levels on which heterogeneity can be found: the terminological, definitional, strategic and practical. Whilst there is much talk about the definitional ambiguities of SRI, we suggest that there is actually some agreement on the definitional level. There are at least three explanations which we suggest can account for the heterogeneity on the other levels: cultural and ideological differences between different regions, differences in values, norms and ideology between various SRI stakeholders, and the market setting of SRI. Discussing the implications of the three explanations for the SRI market, we suggest that there is reason to be sceptical about the possibilities of standardisation if not standardisation is imposed top-down. Whether this kind of standardisation is desirable or not, we argue, depends on what the motives for it would be. To the extent that standardisation may facilitate the mainstreaming of SRI, it could be a good thing - but we entertain doubts about whether mainstreaming really requires standardisation. © Springer 2008.","Ambiguity; Business ethics; Definitions; Ethical investment; Heterogeneity; Mainstreaming; Responsible investment; Socially responsible investment; Standardisation; Sustainable investment",

These latter are pragmatically binding for all partners involved and help to ensure that the ground rules of cooperative communication are observed within a group or an organization. Beyond promoting ethical communication, the communication contract clarifies how individual discursive behaviour can be constructively and ethically monitored by group leaders in business meetings.

The results of this research indicate a significant shift in business ethics as it relates to the employers relationship to the employee within a work environment. It further shows the state of the employment relationship prior to World War II. Written contracts were unheard of, but rather, the employment agreement was steeped in a tradition that carried the promise sealed with nothing but a handshake. Now employees have little or no rights; and the ones they are given are provided not by the employer, but by government regulation and court precedent. Issues such as time off for illness, sexual harassment, and workers' compensation are all handled through legal or regulatory means rather than ethical considerations. The research further shows that the distinct lack of leadership within organizations play a significant role in the disintegration of employer-employee relationships. Specifically, how the lack of leadership relates to the emotional intelligence of the leader. Areas such as empathy and social skills are under trained and under developed by organizations. This research shows that the employer who is willing to give employees what they want and need are far more likely to have success, but more importantly, the organizations will be doing the right thing. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accountability; Corporate social responsibility; Empathy; Enthusiastic employee; Ethics; Living wage; Public education; Responsibility; Rewards; Social skill; Togetherness",

However, the world has been reeling from daily accounts of defective ""Made in China"" products. China has been at the forefront of growing concern, not only about its products and enterprises, but also about its business ethics. This article analyzes recent events connected with the Made in China label from the perspective of evolving Chinese business ethics. Part 1 analyzes three of these events. Part 2 details and analyzes the state of business ethics in China today. Part 3 concludes by exploring the future of business ethics in China. The main conclusion is that business ethics in China faces two kinds of ethical challenges: how to restrict the lawless in as short a period of time as possible and how to protect and advance the interests of employees, investors, and the public through corporate management and public administration. © 2008 Springer science Business Media B.V.","China; Ethics; Scandals",

Numerous contributions argued theoretical frameworks and taxonomies of CSR practices. The authors want to ground in this knowledge and provide further evidence about how companies adopt CSR practices to address stakeholders' claims and consolidate their trust. Evidence was provided by a longitudinal case study about an Italian food company that is one of the largest producers of baby food. This company reshaped its corporate strategy along three decades through the adoption of CSR practices in order to win stakeholders' trust about food safety and supply chain behaviour. The empirical exercise was informed by a literature review of the relevant contributions in terms of CSR business practices and levels of efforts to adopt them. In light of this review, the authors adopted for the research framework the taxonomy of business practices proposed by Spiller (2000, ""Ethical Business and Investment: A Model for Business and Society"", Journal of Business Ethics 27, 149-160) and the levels of commitment towards CSR proposed by Stahl and Grigsby (1997, Strategic Management; Total Quality & Global Competition (Blackwell, Oxford)).

In addition, the study also examines if there are systematic differences across countries (Italy and the US) in the decision to address the concerns of various stakeholder groups. Data was collected from 244 managers and 72 companies simultaneously in two different national business contexts, Italy and the US. The results of the study provide some evidence that managerial perception of three stakeholder group characteristics - power, legitimacy, and urgency - form a parsimonious group of variables that explain the process of stakeholder prioritization. However, only limited support was found for the relationship between salience accorded to a stakeholder group and engagement efforts directed toward the group. The results of the study also show that the managerial decision as to which of the stakeholder groups' demands to address will be influenced by society-specific expectations. The significance of this study lies in investigating the stakeholder prioritization and engagement process, as it is being practiced, which, one could argue, would help in developing guidelines for effective stakeholder management that stands a realistic chance of being adapted and followed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

I then draw out the implications of the Clash's punk ideology for critical accounting educators today, and especially the implications for ethics education. The Clash's message and moral compass are especially relevant today as (like the Clash's England) both Bush's America and an immediately post-Howard Australia have been vastly altered by a harsh neo-liberalism under which alternative (and especially collectivist) voices have been frequently mocked and suppressed. The Clash was able to simultaneously be both realist and idealist and, whilst this contradiction captured the hearts of many, the classic line-up of the band was to disintegrate under the weight of its own contradictions. The critical accounting community is reminded to continue to aspire to both aspects of the realist/idealist dialectic that is so vividly apparent in the Clash's powerful and poignant early work and especially from the self-titled debut album up to Sandinista! © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As evocative linguistic devices, such metaphors are morally neutral; however, if they are indicative of a deep structure of understanding that filters experience, then they have the potential to be ethically problematic. This article argues that there exists a danger for those who forget or confuse metaphor with definition: the metaphoric fallacy. Accordingly, business is like a game, but it is not the equivalent of a game. If business is equated to a game, then the potentially negative implications for ethical content and the application of ethical theories are numerous.

The study examines the use of these structures and processes amongst the top companies in the three countries of Australia, Canada, and Sweden over two time periods (2001-2002 and 2005-2006). Subsequently, a combined comparative and longitudinal approach is applied in the study, which we contend is a unique approach in the area of business ethics. The findings of the study indicate that corporations operating in Sweden have utilized ethical structures and processes differently than their Canadian and/or Australian counterparts, and that in each culture the way that companies fashion their approach to business ethics appears congruent with their national cultural values.

Despite the significance of this ongoing change, existing research has only started to explore the implications of this change for how workers' rights are governed around the globe. This paper addresses this gap by outlining an agenda for future research into the transnational governance of workers' rights.

We have been able to find no substantive literature - academic or otherwise - that addresses either of these two broad topics and audiences. Our modest aim, therefore, is to suggest an agenda of issues, and to begin to explore and analyse some of the possible arguments for and against various philosophical or practical solutions. Part I explores the challenges facing a prize-organizing committee, including problems derived from what Rawls calls the ""fact of pluralism"" in democratic societies (reasonable people will always disagree over some basic values, including those relevant to evaluating business practices), and epistemic issues about how we can justify qualitative judgments on the basis of incomplete quantitative data. We also try to identify risks and opportunity costs for ethics-prize granters.

Respondents were asked to respond to the Ethics Position Questionnaire developed by Forsyth (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 39(1), 175-184, 1980), in order to determine their idealism and relativism levels. Subsequently, they answered questions about five scenarios related to accounting practices, with the objective of measuring their ethical judgments. Based on the idealism and relativism levels of our respondents, they were classified into one of four groups, representing different ethical ideologies (absolutism, exceptionism, subjectivism, and situationism). The results indicated that age was the major determinant of relativism. Contrary to previous research, older respondents revealed themselves significantly more relativistic than younger ones. Gender seems to be the most important determinant of ethical judgments; against expectations, men evidenced significantly stricter judgments than women in two of the five scenarios. Findings also indicated that respondents' ethical judgments did not differ significantly based on their ethical ideology, supporting the idea that ethical ideology is not an important determinant of ethical judgments. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accounting; Business ethics; Ethical decision-making; Ethical ideology; Ethical judgment; Ethics",

It identifies the crux of MacIntyre's critique as centering on the fundamental Aristotelian concepts of internal goods and practices. MacIntyre essentially follows Aristotle in arguing that by privileging external goods over internal goods, business activity - and certainly modern capitalistic business activity - corrupts practices. Thus, from the perspective of virtue ethics, business is morally indefensible. The paper continues with an evaluation of MacIntyre's arguments. The conclusion is drawn that MacIntyre's critique, although partially valid, does not vitiate modern business as he claims.

However, it is unclear whether these new approaches to risk management have been accepted and implemented by the industry. Based on interviews with 20 experienced chief risk officers working in Swedish industry, this explorative study aims at investigating and analyzing current opinions and considerations on the implementation of operational risk management (ORM). The development toward more integrated risk management approaches as proposed in the enterprise risk management (ERM) is also in focus. The results of the interviews indicate that the Swedish industry approach to ORM is today rarely a strictly formalized, straightforward activity. Instead informal, decentralized, pragmatic, bottom-up approaches to ORM are preferred over an ERM approach to overall risk exposures. The respondents stressed that their companies' activities with ORM had been guided by the Swedish regulatory (precautionary) approach, notably regarding environmental and occupational risks. Stakeholders such as the financial markets and insurers, as well as various guidelines and policy documents relating to corporate responsibility and corporate governance had further directed the development. However, as a result of stricter international regulation relating to ORM and ERM, it is likely that incentives for more formalized risk management approaches will emerge also in Sweden. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.","ERM; Operational risk management; Stakeholder analysis; Swedish industry",

Applying Forsyth's (1980, 1992) personal moral philosophy model which consists of two independent ethical ideology dimensions, idealism and relativism, we hypothesized and found support for a positive relationship between creativity and relativism. It appears that creative people are less likely than non-creative people to follow universal rules in their moral decision making. However, contrary to our hypothesis and the general stereotype that creative people are less caring about others, we found a positive relationship between creativity and idealism. These findings indicate that highly creative people are likely to be what Forsyth called ""situationists,"" individuals with both an ethic of caring and a pragmatic moral decision-making style. The finding that creative individuals tend to be situationists, and particularly that they tend to be high in idealism, appears to refute the line of reasoning that argues for a ""creative personality"" characterized in part by social insensitivity.

It is tempting to think that these conflicts can be morally resolved if we gained full knowledge of the situations, were rational enough, and were sufficiently objective. This paper explores the view that there are situations in which people in business must confront the possibility that they must compromise some of their important principles or values in order to protect other ones. One particularly interesting case that captures this kind of situation is that of Google and its operations in China. In this paper, I examine the situation Google faces as part of the larger issue of moral compromise and integrity in business. Though I look at Google, this paper is just as much about the underlying or background views Google faces that are at work in business ethics. In the process, I argue the following: First, the framework Google has used to respond to criticisms of its actions does not successfully or obviously address the important ethical issues it faces. Second, an alternative ethical account can be presented that better addresses these ethical and human rights questions. However, this different framework brings the issue of moral compromise to the fore. This is an approach filled with dangers, particularly since it is widely held that one ought never to compromise one's moral principles. Nevertheless, I wish to propose that there may be a place for moral compromise in business under certain conditions, which I attempt to specify. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Censorship; China; Google; Human rights; Moral compromise",

A morally managed and a self-interested firm compete in a market in which their corporate social performance (CSP) provides product differentiation. Some citizens have altruistic or warm glow preferences for products with associated CSP, personal giving to social causes, holding shares in firms providing CSP, and contributing to social pressure to increase CSP. Social pressure is delivered by an activist NGO funded by voluntary contributions by citizens. The model characterizes an equilibrium in the product market, the capital market, and the market for social pressure. The equilibrium establishes a price for CSP and for activist-induced social pressure. The theory provides predictions of the market values of firms, the prices of products, firm profits, target selection, contributions to the activist, and the amount of CSP supplied. For example, if citizens do not distinguish between morally motivated CSP and CSP induced by social pressure, the activist is more likely to target the softer, morally motivated firm. Higher quality activists are better funded, target self-interested firms, and obtain greater corporate social performance. Lower quality activists target morally managed firms. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,

When managers use this situation for their own benefit, they can undermine the purported goals of the SM approach.

Traditionally, business ethics research emphasized the effects of overt or explicit attitudes on ethical decision-making and neglected intuitive or implicit attitudes. Therefore, based on an implicit social cognition approach it is important to know whether implicit moral attitudes may have a substantial impact on managerial ethical decision-making processes. To test this thesis, a study with 50 participants was conducted. In this study the participants were asked to work on a deliberative managerial ethical decision-making task, in which they had to decide on one of two options. Implicit moral attitudes towards the two options were measured using the implicit association test (IAT). A semantic differential scale was used to diagnose explicit moral attitudes towards the two options. Each step taken within the deliberative decision-making process, as well the decision itself, was assessed using a scoring model-based decision analysis and a decision-making questionnaire. The results of this study show that implicit moral attitude has a great influence on the deliberative ethical decision-making process. The derived conclusion is that complex and deliberative decision-making processes in the context of business ethics can be affected by implicit social cognitions such as implicit moral attitudes. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Ethical decision-making; Implicit association test (IAT); Implicit attitudes; Implicit social cognition; Mental processes; Moral judgements",

This article aims to explore collaborative approaches where enterprises seek to build long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with all stakeholders and want to produce sustainable values for their whole business ecosystem. Cases here analyzed demonstrate that alternative ways of doing business are possible. These enterprises share more democratic ownership structures, more balanced and broader governance systems, and a more comprehensive view of organizational goals and performance - which goes beyond the narrow concept of financial bottom line and into a stronger and systematic care of the needs and requirements of the different stakeholder groups. Thanks to this evidence and different theoretical and empirical contributions, we suggest that the strength and sustainability of enterprises come from their ability to fit into the environmental, social, and cultural context in which they operate. By creating values for all stakeholders, enterprises can involve them and gain deep support based on their commitment.

How important are these results to our understanding of morality and ethics? In addition, more specifically, how important are theses results to our understanding of business ethics? I believe that the jury is still out on these questions. This article: (1) summarizes some of the strengths of evolutionary psychology (of which there are several); (2) identifies specific findings and suggests that many of these findings are overstated and exaggerated; and (3) points out several methodological limitations and weaknesses. The article does not, in the end, recommend jettisoning evolutionary psychology. To the contrary, its point is that evolutionary psychology is a potentially useful method among many others to help us to better understand our ""moral universe."" However, evolutionary psychology will never allow us to pierce through ""the illusions that evolution and culture have saddled us with"" as the psychologist Steven Pinker over-promises. This is true for the simple reason that science itself is both a product of evolution and a cultural practice. The aspiration of some evolutionary psychologists to transcend evolution (nature) and culture (nurture) through science is itself a dangerous illusion. Nevertheless, evolutionary psychology's modest findings to date are a welcome contribution to anyone interested in making better and wiser ethical decisions, business or otherwise. The more knowledge we gain about our own brains and how they functions the better. These findings, however, should be subject to the same systematic scrutiny and healthy skepticism one would apply to any moral or ethical claim regardless of its origins.

But, as in all abstractions, this truth comes at the expense of falsehood - namely, that persons are assets to deploy on behalf of owners. This last is ""wrong"" in both senses of the word - it is factually wrong in that persons are far more than business assets, they are supernatural beings, children of God; and it is morally wrong in that it is an injustice to treat them as the former when they are the latter.

Design/methodology/approach - A normative approach has been adopted and the research is based, primarily, on an examination of relevant literature. Findings - Society facilities the growth of economic entities by providing them with resources. As their command over resources increases, these entities gain significant economic, social and political power and accountability is demanded of their managers as a check on possible abuse of this power. Historically, as companies have increased their power in society, those to whom and that for which their managers are held accountable have been extended. Today, the managers of large public companies are considered to be accountable to society as a whole for a wide range of corporate activities. The discharge of corporate accountability traditionally relied on the preparation and audit of accountability reports (financial statements). However, from the 1990s, responding to the increasing severity of the impact on society of unexpected corporate failures - and continued failures - responsible corporate governance was added as an accountability requirement. Further, as the activities for which companies are accountable have been extended (paralleling the growth of their ""power"" in society), so corporate responsibility information has featured as an element in their accountability reports. As these changes have occurred, the importance of the tripartite audit function in securing corporate accountability has come to be recognised and its members - the company's external and internal auditors and its audit committee - have become increasingly multi-disciplinary in nature. Originality/value - The paper explores the questions of why corporate accountability arises and how it is discharged. It explains the relationship between corporate governance and accountability and the role of the audit function in securing corporate accountability.

First, although there is abundant research that addresses the link between corporate responsibility (CR) and financial performance, hardly any studies scrutinize whether the type of corporate responsibility makes a difference to this link. Second, while the majority of CR research conducted within business studies concentrates on the financial outcomes for the firm, the societal outcomes of CR are left largely unexplored. To tackle these two deficiencies, this article extends the different conceptualizations of corporate responsibility and elaborates both the financial and the societal outcomes of different types of CR. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate responsibility; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance",

After discussing the emergence of business ethics as an academic discipline, it explores and attempts to answer two Marxist objections that might be brought against the enterprise of business ethics. The first is that business ethics is impossible because capitalism itself tends to produce greedy, overreaching, and unethical business behavior. The second is that business ethics is irrelevant because focusing on the moral or immoral conduct of individual firms or businesspeople distracts one's attention from the systemic vices of capitalism. I argue, to the contrary, that, far from being impossible, business requires and indeed presupposes ethics and that for those who share Marx's hope for a better society, nothing could be more relevant than engaging the debate over corporate social responsibility. In line with this, the article concludes by sketching some considerations favoring corporations' adopting a broader view of their social and moral responsibilities, one that encompasses more than the pursuit of profit. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics (as academic subject); Corporate social responsibility; Fiduciary responsibility; Friedman; Marxism; Milton; Prisoner's dilemma; Profit maximization",

In actuality, this fleeing exacerbates them into a sickness of self-idolatry and self-loathing. I bring in Nietzsche's approach to the value of truth and his ascetic priest figure to get to the origin of this problem.

It is now widely accepted that the private sector is a crucial partner in achieving this ambitious target. Building on this insight, the 'Bottom of the Pyramid' concept provides a framework that highlights the untapped opportunities with the 'poorest of the poor', while at the same time acknowledging the abilities and resources of private enterprises for poverty alleviation. This article connects the idea of business with the poor to sustainable development and especially to the notions of inter- and intragenerational justice. These principles of justice can be linked with the 'Bottom of the Pyramid' approach directly through the Rawlsian principles to foster holistic thinking. On this basis, the article offers a normative-ethical reasoning of corporations' possible responsibilities for the poorest of the poor. Today's state of worldwide inequalities is likely to generate future tensions between the privileged western world and the uncounted mass of poor (let alone the ethical dubiousness of this status). However, it is at the same time problematic if not even impossible to improve the situation of the poor by simply copying the resource intensive western way of living to the 'Bottom of the Pyramid' due to the limited carrying capacity of the earth. After highlighting possible moral dilemmas which may occur through such a potential trade off, this article concludes with an outlook on how the concepts 'Bottom of the Pyramid' and sustainable development could be combined. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bottom of the Pyramid; Categorical imperative; Corporate citizenship; Human rights; Intra- and intergenerational equity; Moral dilemma; Poverty alleviation; Rawlsian principles; Sustainable development",

We also find little evidence of causality between financial performance and narrower measures of social performance that focus on stakeholder management.

The findings demonstrate that significant differences do exist between the two countries in idealism and relativism. Moroccan managers tend to be more idealistic than the U.S. managers. There is a strong positive relationship between religiosity and idealism. There were mixed findings in examining the correlates of religiosity and various components of ethical intentions. Moroccan managers were more homogenous in their corporate ethical values than were the U.S. managers. The results demonstrate that (in general) idealism is a good predictor of ethical intentions and behaviors. Additionally, managers from the two countries differed in the degree of relationship between perceptions and intentions in three of the four scenarios.

There is the view that the dominance of the liberal economic philosophy among the American decision makers and business elite resulted in marginalization of the role of the economic government. As a result, the US economy is facing problems in many sectors and might be poorly prepared to face the challenge of globalization in the knowledge-based industries. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides review and critique of the contemporary literature of ""declininists"" proclaiming the end of the American Empire. Findings - In order to restore the strength of the US economy and utilize its potential, Americans must consider a new generation of politicians and legislators capable of reforming the tax system, stepping up the supervision of the financial sector, eliminating inequality in education and reforming the electoral system. Research limitations/implications - America is at a turning point. The problems of the American economy are home-made, but their implications are international. In the last two decades the USA pursued a dysfunctional dual dependence on imports of manufactured goods and capital. Allowing the dollar devaluation has been a short-sighted policy which will have dire consequences on import-dependent economy and the USA's position in the world economy. Liberal prescriptions of self-regulating markets cannot replace long-term government economic strategy which America badly needs today. Practical implications - Since the liberal wishful-thinking failed, economists, politicians and legislators should stop evoking conservative liberal mantras and start working on responsible economic policy solutions before the US economy plunges into a deep recession and years of damaging pessimism. Originality/value - Rather than repeating arguments of the authors proclaiming the end of American Empire, the paper looks for chances and opportunities for the US economy's rejuvenation in the future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate responsibility; Economic policy; Globalization; National economy; United States of America",

It aims to deepen our understanding of such social practices in their cultural, social, economic and political contexts by examining portrayals of business and accounting transactions and of reflections of social and economic concerns in two German novels set during a time of economic and political crisis, namely the Weimar Republic's hyperinflation period. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses, against the historical, social and economic backgrounds of the inflation period, the novels' authors' social and political perspectives as reflected in the novels; the literary devices employed; the way in which the description of business and accounting matters aids our understanding of everyday inflation period transactions and underlying economic and social concerns; and the links made between accounting/business, money and inflation on the one hand, and morality and rationality on the other hand. Findings: The paper finds that in this exceptional economic situation, the relationship between accounting and morality as explored by Maltby is reversed. The portrayal of (often unusual and creative) economic transactions is used to illustrate the lack of economic, legal and moral certainty experienced by individuals and to evoke and critique the damage caused by the hyperinflation on German society and on human relationships, including the commoditisation of all aspects of life and the resulting moral decline. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature exploring the role of representations of business/accounting and finance in narrative fiction. The novels examined here provide an alternative means for observing, interpreting and critiquing social phenomena, specifically in a setting where financial considerations dominate human interaction and social relationships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fiction; Germany; History; Hyperinflation; Literature",

Corporate Social Responsibility is increasingly discussed in economics and management studies today. This idea is fairly recent and stems from a philosophical school of thought attributed to Hans Jonas, which says that nature must be preserved for anthropocentric as well as biocentric reasons. In this respect, the consequences that these two visions imply for men and companies will be developed. Corporate leaders often make use of this concept, which finds its origins in philosophy, in order to analyse the normative behaviour of their companies. In this respect we shall favour a jonasian interpretation. Hans Jonas will help us question the fundamental meaning of responsibility. We will attempt to investigate this meaning using CSR. More specifically, this article tries to answer the question: what exactly is corporate responsibility? Is it a mere concept currently in fashion, or is it a new structural approach which could indeed take responsibility into account in so far as long-term environmental preservation is concerned? In order to answer this question, we shall first propose a reading of ""stakeholders"". This approach poses several problems when dealing with corporate responsibility regarding the preservation of nature. Secondly, we shall present a more detailed analysis of such corporate social responsibility and the problems it poses. The debate regarding action with the interest of its outcome and action in the interest of the action itself shall be the focal point of our discussion. This article will adopt a narrative and critical methodology. So as to achieve this goal, we propose to critically analyse theoretical paradigms and test them through case studies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We found that one population of firms was aligned with increasing pressures from its stakeholders for improved environmental performance, and the other was influenced by local cultural, political, and economic ideals less demanding of environmental actions.

Both sides of this argument - that good ethics is good business and that bad ethics is bad business - are explored. The possibility of a moral floor above which ethical behavior is not rewarded is considered, and an economic experiment testing such a proposition is discussed. Johnson & Johnson suffers a potentially devastating blow when some cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules cause several deaths. Johnson & Johnson voluntarily pulls Tylenol off the shelf, to universal acclaim. When Tylenol is returned to the marketplace, its share of the over-the-counter painkiller market becomes greater than it was before the tragedy. Arthur Andersen, the venerable accounting firm, is caught in the web surrounding the downfall of Enron, Inc. As Enron's various sins are discovered, it is found that Arthur Andersen auditors had signed off on flawed audits and had shredded documents to cover themselves. Andersen is prosecuted for, and convicted of, obstructing justice (although the conviction is later overturned). Today the firm barely exists and has no resemblance to the Big Five accounting giant of 1999. These stories seem to indicate that ethical (or unethical) behavior leads to positive (or negative) financial results. But the philosophical arguments underpinning such statements are seldom subjected to proper analysis. They are perhaps wishful thinking, or perhaps based on examples such as the above without considering other examples that may reinforce a contrary position. This paper will explore the philosophical arguments and empirical evidence regarding these statements and state some research questions for exploration in this area. In particular we will propose the possibility that a moral floor exists above which firms that engage in ethical activities will not reap rewards, but below which firms that engage in unethical activities will be punished by actors in the economic marketplace. We will discuss an economic experiment to determine if such actors indeed form a moral floor. © Springer 2009.","Corporate financial performance; Corporate social performance; Ethical behavior",

This article argues that reputations for CSP are often unrepresentative of true CSP and investigates how differences in 'perceived' and 'actual' - as measured by the Fortune and KLD databases, respectively - can partly be explained by firm characteristics. Amongst other things, it finds that overrated firms are more likely to be relatively big, profitable, operating in non-polluting but competitive industries and with no history of wrong doings to their primary stakeholders.

This shift from implicit to explicit corporate social responsibility is an indication of a major institutional change epitomized by the deconstruction of 'old' and the reconstruction of 'new' institutions.

Stakeholder management has become an important tool to transfer ethics to management practice and strategy. Nevertheless, legitimate criticism continues to insist on clarification and emphasises on the perfectible nature of the model. Here, rather than building on the discussion from a philosophical or theoretical point of view, a different and innovative approach has been chosen: the analysis will return to the origin of stakeholder theory and will keep the graphical framework firmly in perspective. It will confront the stakeholder model's graphical representation to the discussion on stakeholder definition, stakeholder identification and categorisation, to re-centre the debate to the strategic origin of the stakeholder model. The ambiguity and the vagueness of the stakeholder concept are discussed from managerial and legal approaches. The impacts of two major shortcomings of the popular stakeholder framework are examined: the boundaries and the level of the firm's environment, and the ambivalent position of pressure groups and regulators. Working pragmatically, with a focus on the managerial and organisational perspective, an attempt is made to clarify the categorisations and classifications by introducing new terminology with a distinction between stakeholders, stakewatchers and stakekeepers.

As an open end of the article a few wider questions are asked about the use of literature in addition to or instead of ethics when it comes to triggering moral reflection and imagination. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics teaching; Heinz' dilemma; Ibsen; Moral conflict scenarios",

After summarizing evolutionary theory and natural selection, we specifically address the use of evolutionary concepts in psychology in order to offer alternative explanations of behavior relevant to business ethics, such as social exchange, cooperation, altruism, and reciprocity. Our position is that individuals, groups, and organizations all are affected by similar natural, evolutionary processes, such that evolutionary psychology is applicable at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., individual and group). We introduce a variety of experiments and instruments employed by evolutionary psychologists to illustrate how ethics-relevant cultural norms and practices evolve and are regulated, and to raise the prospect that these experiments and instruments can be useful in future business ethics research. © 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly 19:4 (October 2009).",,

The approach holds that human beings are fundamentally free and have a sense of human dignity. Therefore, institutions need to help people enhance this dignity by providing them with the opportunity to develop their capabilities freely. I argue that this approach may help support business ethics based on virtue. Since teleology has become problematic, virtue ethics has had difficulty giving itself an ultimate justification. By combining virtue ethics with the capabilities approach, it becomes possible to ground virtue ethics on the basis of the existence of human dignity. This frees virtue ethics of the need for a strict teleology, replacing it with the notion that people must work to develop the capabilities of others although those capabilities are not pointed toward a definite goal. I further suggest that by grounding virtue ethics in capabilities, the actions of a virtuous manager become clearer. Rather than simply charging a manager with serving the public, the manager is charged with serving the stakeholders in a way that develops their capabilities. For example, a manager should not just give their employees what is just but must give them the environment and the encouragement to grow and to find fulfillment in their job. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Capabilities approach; Nussbaum; Sen; Solomon; Virtue ethics",

The purpose of this investigation was to identify any correlations between sector characteristics and the contents of the codes of ethics, which would enable us to map out the main principles followed in writing the companies' codes of ethics. The analysis was conducted in order to ascertain whether there were common factors deriving from the shared ethical questions faced by the companies operating in the same sector of activity. As the first step, the 40 companies were subdivided into three main economic categories - Industrial, Financial and Service. Then the contents of each code of ethics were evaluated and classified in accordance with different criteria. The main categories of classification were based on - general principles, social values, rules of conduct, relationships with third parties, implementation and sanctions. The next objective was to investigate whether these characteristics were due to the regulation of the sector of reference, the existence of sector benchmarks for best practice, or simply companies' voluntary stance on ethical issues. The main conclusions were that the codes of ethics of the Italian companies that we analysed do not seem to show relevant differences traceable to sector of activity, and their adoption is affected by several reasons other than intentionally ethical considerations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Code of ethics; Content analysis; Corporate social responsibility; Italian quoted companies",

Many others consider whether the process by which CEOs are paid is compromised by weak or self-serving boards of directors. This paper examines the issue from a new perspective. I focus on the duties executives themselves have with respect to their own compensation. I argue that CEOs' fiduciary duties place a moral limit on how much compensation they can accept, and hence seek in negotiation, from their firms.

We qualify this process by proposing conditions more ripe for anomie and under which this deinstitutionalization is more likely to occur, propounding moderating relationships that influence organizational reconfiguration.

Second, organizational justice researchers have investigated one set of individual differences, behavioral researchers have examined another. Third, justice scholars focus on social identities while behavioral ethics scholars also investigate moral identities.

However, recent insights have shown that the empirical branch of business ethics lacks thorough theoretical grounding. This article discusses the use of the Rawlsian methods of wide reflective equilibrium and overlapping consensus in the field of applied ethics. Instead of focussing on one single comprehensive ethical doctrine to provide adequate guidance for resolving moral dilemmas, these Rawlsian methods seek to find a balance between considered judgments and intuitions concerning particular cases on the one hand and general principles and theories on the other. In business ethics this approach is promising because it enables decision-making in a pluralist context with different stakeholders who often endorse different or even conflicting cultural and moral frameworks without giving priority to any of them. Moreover, the method is well founded in political theory. A taxonomy of different kinds of applications is developed, and classified according to the purpose, the content, and the type of justification. On the basis of this taxonomy an inventory of 12 recent applications is made. In terms of the purpose and content of the method the applications are rather diverse. Two conceptual obstacles for applying Rawlsian methods are identified, viz. inclusiveness and the communitarian objection that people have to become detached from their personal life. It is found that methodological questions, such as the question how to retrieve the relevant empirical data, are scarcely addressed in the literature. To advance the use of empirical approaches in general, and that of Rawlsian approaches in particular, it is important not only to use empirical data but to use methodological insights from social sciences in order to further advance the field of empirical ethics. It is recommended that stakeholders be given a more active role in the assessment and justification of these methods. © Springer 2009.","Applied ethics; Conflicting values; Ethical methodology; Justification; Overlapping consensus; Rawls; Wide reflective equilibrium",

Key in this literature is the concept of rationalization. This is where individuals attempt to justify past and future corrupt deeds to themselves and others. In this article, we argue that rationalization often entails a process of overcompensation whereby the justification forwarded is excessive in relation to the actual act. Such over-rationalization provides an impetus for further and more serious acts of illegality. Using a number of high profile cases, it is argued that this dynamic gap between the act and excessive rationalization can explain why corruption often escalates in severity and scope in the organization. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corruption; Dynamic; Escalation; Overcompensation; Rationalization",

This increased interest is due largely to managers' desire to reduce the incidence of unwanted behaviors in the workplace. This article examines one major moderator of the ethical decision-making process - moral intensity. In particular, we explore the potential influence of a particular cognitive heuristic - the availability heuristic - on perceptions of moral intensity. It is our contention that moral intensity is a perceptual construct, and that individuals' use of the availability heuristic will influence perceptions of moral intensity which, in turn, will affect how moral issues are viewed and ultimately resolved. In this article, we present propositions concerning possible relationships between the availabilities of various phenomena and the components that moral intensity comprises, and report on two studies examining the effects of availabilities on two of these components: magnitude of consequences and social consensus. Our findings indicated that the availability of consequences associated with an act was positively related to perceptions of the magnitude of consequences of that act. We also found that the availability of others who believe that a particular act is morally acceptable is positively related to perceptions of social consensus that that act is morally acceptable. We posit that our results suggest the possibility that perceptions of moral intensity can be actively influenced to reduce unethical behavior in organizations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Availability heuristic; Cognitive bias; Ethical decision-making; Issue recognition; Moral intensity",

This transformation occurred in response to changes in the competitive environment of U.S. corporations and also to the agency theory argument that high levels of compensation by means of stock options helped to overcome the agency problem inherent in the separation of ownership and control. Some critics charge that this new CEO role is objectionable for a variety of reasons, which may also be applicable to the current financial crisis in which CEO misconduct may have played a part. These objections are based largely on a team production model of corporate governance, which is held by these critics to be superior to the standard agent-principal model. This article examines the objections offered by critics of the changed role of the CEO and argues that their negative assessment of this development and their use of the team production model to support their conclusions are not warranted. CEOs have changed from hired hands to co-owners, and this change may have contributed in some measure to the current financial crisis. However, in determining the morally preferable role of the CEO, care must be taken not to discard what is sound in the changed role. © 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly 19:4 (October 2009).",,

A preliminary question which should be dealt with first is whether corporations can actually dispose of any 'social' or 'moral' responsibility. Many scholars used to ferociously oppose the idea of organizations carrying any responsibilities, unlike the formerly powerful nobles or industrialists who assumed greater responsibilities for society, corporations do not constitute 'natural' persons. The question of whether a positive correlation between good corporate social performance and financial performance can be proved is of particular interest in this context.

By adopting the operational strictures of economy, efficiency and performance, many universities are behaving like and being run as though they were a business. The term 'corporate university' now carries much meaning and has been the subject of significant discourse over the last decade. Resource limitations, political influences and competitive pressures are commonplace with implications for the way in which a university can fulfil a role in society, however that is defined. In this paper we consider the notion of corporate citizenship and ask whether this concept is relevant to the role of a university in Australia and New Zealand. In these countries universities are substantially (although progressively less so) funded by the government and are public service entities. The application of corporate citizenship to universities serves to highlight the duality of these institutions, which operate like corporations, and yet have more obvious historically based obligations to society. The comparison also suggests that as corporations are becoming more aware of the long-term benefits of a societal role for business entities that universities appear to be moving in the opposite direction. With a few exceptions academics have been reluctant to engage in public debates. They have progressively lost control of their working environment. The risk is that the public interest will have no place in the corporatised university of the 21st century unless academics increase their critic and conscience activities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, paradoxically, the cornerstone of this phenomenon, economic performance, varies widely across the world whatever indicator (for example, GDP/habitant, competitiveness) we choose to use to compare countries. Increasingly, studies tend to explain this apparently paradoxical situation with reference to the issue of corruption and ethics. In essence, corruption is perceived to be an important impediment to the economic development of a country (or area). Many studies of corruption are focused at the national level. The aim of this conceptual paper is to explore the role of the firm (as opposed to national states or international institutions) as an influence on national corruption. We call for firms to reconsider their behavior regarding corruption, particularly in relation to their relationships with their stakeholders. We argue that by focusing on issues such as cooperation and stakeholder theory, a firm will change the way it does businesses by reducing private-to-public as well as private-to-private corruption and incorporating business ethics into its management strategies.","Cooperation; Corruption; Ethics; Globalization; Stakeholder theory; Strategic management",

Using an in-depth case study approach, this model is then applied to one firm - Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). Developing an understanding of the figurative black box of SAS's motivations contributes to unlocking the reasons why corporations are choosing (or not) to commit to CSER. If these reasons are known, they can be used to develop appropriate mechanisms to ensure that CSER is an important aspect of a company's decision-making regime.

The law was passed in response to the horrendous corporate disasters that had occurred, including Enron, Worldcom, Adelphia, and Tyco. The implementation of effective business ethics became essential and the new law required the publication of corporate codes of ethics. It did not mandate their content. This paper suggests specific sections for inclusion in the general guidelines to encompass the ethical dimensions of the Act. It analyzes the compliance by the corporations in their public filings since Sarbanes-Oxley became law. The revelation of the size of the audit and accounting fees paid to Arthur Andersen by Enron and similar fees paid in other current financial debacles lead to another key requirement of Sarbanes-Oxley: mandatory auditor rotation. Here, however, Sarbanes-Oxley did not go far enough. The law required rotation only of the lead auditor within a firm. This paper submits that it should have required rotation of audit firms instead. The positions of the public companies, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Government Accountability Office, and accounting journals are explored as to the rotation of auditor firms regarding audit-partner rotation within a firm. The paper concludes that Sarbanes-Oxley should be expanded to require audit-firm rotation. This expansion is necessary to reinforce the independence of the public accountant, both in fact and appearance, and to restore competition within the accounting profession, which will benefit the investing public. It is up to the Security and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, ultimately, Congress to make this expansion a reality.","Accounting; Arthur andersen; Audit-firm rotation; Auditing; Auditor rotation; Codes of ethics; Corporate governance; Enron; Ethics education; Sarbanes-Oxley",

Gardner, best known for his seminal work on multiple intelligences, grounds his major conclusions primarily on the results of his impressive, decade-long, and massive Good Works Project. Despite my several agreements and significant overlap with Howard Gardner, I believe that there is insufficient evidence to accept fully his policy prescriptions. Gardner's selection of the five minds of the future - the disciplined, synthesizing, creating, respectful, and ethical minds - is based on a set of limiting assumptions concerning globalization, good work, individuality, power and control, disciplines as value-free enterprises, ethics as the point of view of the universe, and the completeness of his list. This paper suggests that our conception of education might be dramatically expanded to include a more critical and distanced stance towards: globalization, the current goals of business, individualism, the traditional disciplines, and even ethics than Gardner currently imagines. Its aims can and should be broadened to include not only good work, but also love and play. Students must learn how to control their environments, but also how to appreciate and accept life's inevitable difficulties and limits. Ethics should certainly play a more central role in education as Gardner correctly emphasizes, but our understanding of ethics must include not only respect but also care; not only principles but also dialog. To accomplish all of this, however, requires us to think beyond Gardner's five minds to include additional ""mental dispositions"" like the caring, critical, intersubjective, spiritual, and joyful minds. Each of these ""minds"" is explored in this paper. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Howard Gardner; Spirituality; Teaching business ethics",

It is noticed; that the decisions made in the various situations differ, as far as ethics is concerned. Having analyzed these situations, it is possible to distinguish recurrent regularity, which is summarized by the authors and submitted as determinant factors of decision making process. Analysis of factors influencing ethics of marketing decisions can help to find out how to encourage ethical decisions in researched business sector. The authors rather widely give different approaches how different factors influence ethicalness of a decision taking process. They give different schemes, models. But authors do not compare factors influencing ethicalness of marketing and conditions when these factors operate. This does not give a full view and determines slower integration of marketing ethical rules to every day life of any business sector, in which following of ethical rules would become matter-of-course.","Individual factors; Marketing ethics; Media; Organisational factors",

The absence of universally accepted indicators of university effectiveness creates assumptions to differently interpret results, which distorts objective view of university effectiveness in the market.

The bank's strategy centres on providing local friendly service delivered by civic-minded small-business people through a franchised community bank model. The article aims to contribute to our understanding of emotions in organizations by highlighting the ways in which nostalgia can be used positively to create connections between customer service and human resource strategies. These connections are made possible through a discourse of community that appeals to a desire for genuine social relationships, personal authenticity, moral certainty and a sense of belonging.

The interactions investigated were not restricted to stakeholder relationships but included other communications between different stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a case study approach framed within a contested political arena. Data were gathered using multiple methods including interviews with salmon farming organisations, stakeholders, rule-enforcers, issue amplifiers and political institutions. Findings - All arena participants used social reports in their interactions to communicate the social, environmental and economic consequences of salmon farming. Different social reporting practices appeared to be reflexively related to the competing motivations of different stakeholders. However, social reporting in Scottish salmon farming was fragmented, driven by many different factors and did not necessarily lead to a resolution of the conflicts within this arena. Research limitations/implications - Researching social reporting should consider the co-existence and co-evolution of different social reports, competing motivations and engagement tactics of stakeholders. This paper identifies the construction of holistic reports from multiple reports and issue amplification as two research methods to engage in social and environmental policy debates. Originality/value - This paper presents empirical evidence from an under-researched industry, which has the potential to develop the theoretical understanding of social reporting. It also introduces the arena concept as a useful tool in further social reporting research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fish farming; Reporting; Scotland; Social accounting; Stakeholder analysis",

The purpose of this paper is to assess the strategies used by listed property trusts (LPTs) in Australia in delivering excellence and international best practice in environmental sustainability for commercial property. Design/methodology/approach - Using content analysis, the annual reports, corporate responsibility and sustainability reports, and carbon disclosure reports for all LPTs in Australia are assessed. These public domain documents are used to identify the corporate strategies used by LPTs for implementing international best practice in environmental sustainability for the LPT commercial property portfolios. Findings - The paper finds that Australian LPTs are seen to be strategically implementing a wide range of procedures regarding environmental sustainability. These contributions represent international best practice in environmental sustainability procedures, and include strategies at the corporate, portfolio and individual commercial property levels. These results confirm the strong leadership role of Australian LPTs in implementing international best practice in environmental sustainability in commercial property. Originality/value - Previous research into sustainable commercial property has largely focused on the valuation implications with sustainability and the various sustainability rating tools. This paper rigorously assesses the strategic issues concerning implementing international best practice in environmentally sustainable commercial property; particularly highlighting the strong leadership role of LPTs in Australia in implementing these international best practices. Given the increasing significance of environmental sustainability and commercial property, this research enables more informed and practical investment decision making by property companies regarding the implementation of environmental sustainability procedures for their commercial property portfolios which are seen to be international best practice.","Benchmarking; Best practice; Corporate social responsibility; Property; Sustainable design; Trusts",

CSR is used as an umbrella term to describe much of what is done in terms of ethics-related activities in firms around the globe to such an extent that some consider it a ""tortured concept"" (Godfrey and Hatch 2007, Journal of Business Ethics 70, 87-98). Addressing this skepticism, I argue in this article that the focus on CSR is indeed problematic for three main reasons: (1) the term carries a lot of historical baggage - baggage that is not necessarily conducive to the clarity of the concept; (2) it is the object of increasing ethical instrumentalism; and (3) given the multiple ethical challenges that corporations face, and given the fact that the ""social"" responsibilities of business are but one set of corporate responsibilities, a suitable term would have to be more inclusive and integrative. I therefore suggests moving instead toward a sound definition of corporate integrity and aim in this article to develop a working definition by fleshing out ""7 Cs"" of integrity: commitment, conduct, content, context, consistency, coherence, and continuity. I then discuss how these 7 Cs impact our understanding of CSR or, more broadly, corporate responsibility in general. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate integrity; Corporate social responsibility; Integrity",

Using institutional organisation theory as a background this paper analyses corporate responsibility reporting in the world's ten largest pulp and paper companies, representing 25% of global production capacity. The studied companies have their headquarters in Japan, the Nordic countries or North America, and have very different geographical and cultural bases and variable company product portfolios ranging from wood-based products and printing papers to packaging boards and consumer goods. Both quantitative and qualitative economic, environmental and social metrics from the annual and social responsibility reports of the companies were analysed regarding institutionalised, culture-specific and company-specific characteristics. The results showed that regulated financial and environmental reporting leaves little flexibility for company-specific diversification in reporting. Only a few regional characteristics were identified, mainly in social responsibility reporting, while the reporting largely reflected a general North American-Nordic type of corporate responsibility and the globalisation trend of the studied companies.

This apparent ambivalence in CSR consequences invites a literature study that can clarify the debate and allow for the drawing of conclusions. The results of the literature study performed here reveal that there is indeed clear empirical evidence for a positive correlation between corporate social and financial performance.

These challenges can be tackled by an institutional transformation in business ethics that links up to the long-standing European tradition of institutional analysis of the market.

Firstly, the paper reviews literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and especially on the creation of social capital for SMEs. An exploration of Strategic Management Theory follows, focusing on the Positioning and Competence Based Schools, with the objective to find an answer to the question: how do social and environmental issues fit in the logic of creation of competitive advantage and what role do they play during strategic planning? The contributions of Hart (natural resourced based view) and Porter and Kramer (development of strategic intent in social responsible actions) are then related to the framework of possible growth paths of SMEs (Hong and Jeong, 2006, Journal of Enterprise Information Management 19(3), 292-302) in order to answer this question. Strategies that could trigger or lever these growth paths are then discussed. Following the recommendation Thompson and Smith (1991, Journal of Small Business Management 29(1), 30-44) gave to focus on the ""study of CSR behaviors instead of perceptions,"" a medium-sized Austrian company in the food producing industry has been identified for an exploratory case study analysis to test the applicability of this theoretical framework for the description of the actual responsible business behavior (RBB) of an SME.

Results of the PLS structural equation modeling showed that both an attitude and subjective norm favoring corruption led to a desire to act corruptly.

Interviews included questions about health and positive and negative relationship qualities with spouse, children, and friends/relatives. A total of 39% (N = 827) of participants were deceased by 2005. In support of the main effect model, Cox proportional hazard regressions revealed that consistently low levels of positive support and an increase in negativity from spouse or child from 1986 to 1989 were associated with increased mortality.

These two approaches supplement each other. It is demonstrated that issue-focussed stakeholder management dominates in multi-stakeholder networks, because it enables corporations to address complex problems and challenges in cooperation with stakeholders.

In order to remedy this lack of empirical substantiation in the field, we review the related literature on researcher interaction biases, present an empirical example of how such biases can influence research results in an experiment assessing reactions to insurance fraud, and discuss the implications for business ethics research. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Insurance fraud; Interviewer bias; Methods bias; Research methods",

My account of Levinas's philosophy will show that it challenges - breaking down - deeply entrenched distinctions in the dominant strands of moral philosophy, within which the theory of individual responsibility is embedded, such as between:(1) duty to others on the one hand and supererogation on the other; (2) perfect duty to others on the one hand and imperfect duties to others on the other; (3) insiders and outsiders; kith and kin on the one hand and strangers on the other; Levinas's moral vision is an inclusive one which embraces all of humanity (at least of those present today) irrespective of historical, linguistic, cultural differences and diversities. In other words, each has responsibilities for and duties towards all others. Of course, one might say that there is nothing new about a universalising ethics - after all Kantianism, liberalism as well as utilitarianism are well known instances. However, more crucially, all these traditional moral philosophies uphold the theory of individual responsibility, which is rooted in the philosophy of individualism. Such a philosophy can make sense only of the concept of individual moral/legal agency but not corporate agency. Therefore, in this article I will attempt to show that the Levinasian vision is able to help us change our view with respect to corporate responsibility. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate responsibility; Face; Justice; Levinas; Saying; Sociality",

Common recommendations to strengthen consent in low income settings include seeking permission from community members through existing structures before approaching individuals, considering informed consent as a process rather than a single event, and assessing participant understanding using questionnaires. In this paper, we report on a qualitative study exploring community understanding and perceptions of a malaria vaccine trial (MVT) conducted in a rural setting on the Kenyan Coast. The MVT incorporated all of the above recommendations into its information-giving processes. The findings support the importance of community level information-giving and of giving information on several different occasions before seeking final individual consent. However, an emerging issue was that inter-personal interactions and relationships between researchers and community members, and within the community, play a critical role in participants' perceptions of a study, their decisions to consent or withdraw, and their advice to researchers on study practicalities and information to feedback at the end of the trial. These relationships are based on and continually tested by information-giving processes, and by context specific concerns and interests that can be difficult to predict and are well beyond the timescale and reach of single research activities. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the current move towards increasingly ambitious and stringent formal standards for information-giving to individuals be counter-balanced with greater attention to the diverse social relationships that are essential to the successful application of these procedures. This may be assisted by emphasising respecting communities as well as persons, and by recognising that current guidelines and regulations may be an inadequate response to the complex, often unpredictable and ever shifting ethical dilemmas facing research teams working 'in the field'. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Results suggested that business students who received business ethics intervention significantly changed their conceptions of unethical behavior and reduced their propensity to engage in theft; while psychology students without intervention had no such changes. Therefore, ethics training had some impacts on business students' learning and education (intelligence). For our theoretical model, results of the whole sample (N = 298) revealed that Machiavellianism (measured at Time 1) was a mediator of the relationship between the love of money (measured at Time 1) and unethical behavior (measured at Time 2) (the Love of Money → Machiavellianism → Unethical Behavior). Further, this mediating effect existed for business students (n = 198) but not for psychology students (n = 100), for male students (n = 165) but not for female students (n = 133), and for male business students (n = 128) but not for female business students (n = 70). Moreover, when examined alone, the direct effect (the Love of Money → Unethical Behavior) existed for business students but not for psychology students.

What are their attitudes on the responsibilities of business in society? Do the attitudes of women students differ from those of men? What is the influence of business education on these attitudes? Our sample comprised 217 students pursuing a master's degree in business studies at two Finnish universities. The results show that, as a whole, students valued the stakeholder model of the company more than the shareholder model. However, attitudes differed according to gender: women students were more in favor of the stakeholder model and placed more weight on corporate ethical, environmental, and societal responsibilities than their men counterparts - both at the beginning and at the end of their studies. Thus, no gender socialization effect of business school education could be observed in this sense. Business school education was found to shape women and men students' attitudes in two ways. Firstly, valuation of the shareholder model increased and, secondly, the importance of equal-opportunity employment decreased in the course of education. This raises the question whether the educational context is creating an undesirable tendency among future business professionals. The results further suggest that the sociocultural context can make a difference in how corporate social responsibility is perceived. The article also discusses possible ways to influence the attitudes of business students. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Attitude; Business; Business education; Corporate social responsibility; Finland; Gender; Responsibility; Socialization",

Morality rejects the idea of choice and the interests of the professional as immoral. Yet the dreadful retaliations against the messengers of the truth make it necessary for morality to leave a way out of whistle-blowing. This is why it forges rights (sometimes called duties) to trump the duty to the public prescribed by professional codes. This serves to hide the obvious fact that whether to blow the whistle is indeed a choice, not a matter of objective duty. One should also notice that if it fails to achieve anything then blowing the whistle was the wrong decision (or maybe the right decision that nobody would want to make). There is nevertheless a tendency to judge it based on the motivation of the whistle blower. In a way, whistle blowers should strive to act like saints. Yet, it is logically impossible to hold both whistle-blowing as mandatory and whistle-blowers as heroes or saints. Moreover, this tends to value the great deeds of a few over the lives of the many, which is incompatible with the basic assumptions of morality.

However, at one crucial point in his theory, Sacconi introduces the concept of stakeholders' conformist preferences - their disposition to punish the firm if it defects from the agreement, refusing to abide by its own explicit CSR policies and norms. We take issue with him over this concept: we show that the assumption of conformist preferences is a moral premise, and it arguably weakens the normativity of the theory as a whole. As an alternative, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic approach. We draw upon recent applications of evolutionary game theory to moral philosophy (Skyrms, Danielson), and we use a computer simulation of the trust game. According to this approach, the failure of the logic of reputation, which is the problem conformist preferences were introduced to solve, is overcome through the dynamics of interaction. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","CSR; Evolutionary game theory; Lorenzo Sacconi; Social contract theory; Trust game",

Based on an ethnographic study in three poor urban neighborhoods and their civil courthouse, I examine the mode of conduct in the latter and the ways in which this mode is perceived. This study shows that routinized divergences from formalistic premises in the courthouse are not perceived as flaws, but placed within informal relations. This enmeshing of formal and informal practices is considered normal by both the legal professionals and lay low-income litigants. These constituencies, however, perceive this conduct rather differently in relation to their own and others' attributes. Lay low-income litigants locate it within a broader idiom of ""doing administration,"" a series of tactics to engage within a horizon of perpetual injustice. For legal professionals, on the other hand, the daily mixing of formal and informal practices has to do with their mission of ""educating"" and transforming those in need to participate in the culture of the state. I discuss the particular relation of these two perceptions in normalizing the view of the law as a site, not of formal egalitarianism, but of hierarchical social engagements.","Informal conduct; Law and inequality; Legal professionals; Socio-legal studies; Urban poor",

This debate ranged over history, lineage, reputation, social relationships, modes of livelihood and customary practices. It was conducted along the intellectual and social networks that linked the shrine towns and sacred centres of the Maratha country with the Maratha pandit communities of Banaras, then engaged in their own allied discussions about the nature of early modern India's social order. More locally, puranic and allied genres of narrative history engaged with the same question, offering com-peting versions of the origins and moral qualities of the region's Brahman communities. The appropriateness of the different kinds of agricultural work and petty trade common amongst them lay at the heart of these debates. As the region's Brahman communities began to define themselves as a new kind of scribal and administrative elite in the early modern period, and to compete for the advantages and resources that such service livelihoods offered, associations with menial work became a key discursive marker of Brahman unfitness.

The love of money construct is captured through the Love of Money Scale as used in Luna-Arocas and Tang [Journal of Business Ethics 50 (2004) 329]. Response to 25 business vignettes taken from Conroy and Emerson [Journal of Business Ethics 50 (2004) 383] would surface ethical attitudes.

The study finds some differences in the ethical attitudes of Malaysian Christians in business with different levels of religiousness. The study also finds that those longer in the faith are less accepting of unethical behavior. As such it can be concluded that there are ethical attitude differences between Christians in business with different levels of religiousness. This lends support to the claim of a positive relationship between religion and business ethics. The more significant finding is that even within a somewhat homogenous religious group there are different love of money profiles resulting in significant differences in ethical attitudes.

Focusing on the case of mental illness but drawing from theories and studies of stigma across the social sciences, we propose a framework that brings together theoretical insights from micro, meso and macro level research: Framework Integrating Normative Influences on Stigma (FINIS) starts with Goffman's notion that understanding stigma requires a language of social relationships, but acknowledges that individuals do not come to social interaction devoid of affect and motivation. Further, all social interactions take place in a context in which organizations, media and larger cultures structure normative expectations which create the possibility of marking ""difference"". Labelling theory, social network theory, the limited capacity model of media influence, the social psychology of prejudice and discrimination, and theories of the welfare state all contribute to an understanding of the complex web of expectations shaping stigma.

Yet the desire for more income remains a powerful motive among many people at all income levels. Is this simply because many people are misinformed and believe that higher incomes will make them happier, or are they motivated by something other than the pursuit of happiness? This paper argues for the latter. The paper begins by exploring this question, reviewing the literature on income and subjective well-being, and discussing of the role of utility in decision making. This paper then argues that three main factors lead us to value increased income even if it does not make us happier. First, happiness is just one value among many, and not the only conscious goal people set for themselves. Second, even when people are striving to maximize happiness, our tendency to overweight short-term payoffs leads us to overvalue the short-term rewards that income provides. Finally, I argue that our values-based decision making competes with other motivational systems and evolutionary drives. Three evolutionary desires are discussed: (1) to store resources, (2) to be sexually attractive, and (3) to manage our social relationships and our personal identity within those relationships. While all three motivations play a role in our desire for increased income, this paper argues that it is the third - the use of money and consumption as a social tool - that has the most important overall influence on our desire for increased income past the point where it ceases to increase personal happiness. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a survey of tax professionals in Hong Kong. Findings - The paper finds that Machiavellianism affects tax advisors' expressed viewpoints toward the importance of corporate ethics and social responsibility, which affect professional judgements toward aggressive tax minimisation. As anticipated, high Machiavellians are more likely to endorse the traditional ""stockholder view"" of corporate responsibility (which holds that corporations have little responsibility beyond maximising their profits), and less likely to support the ""stakeholder view"" (which recognises corporate responsibilities to a broader range of potential stakeholders). The stockholder view (but not the stakeholder view) of corporate responsibility mediates the relationship between Machiavellianism and ethical/social responsibility judgements. Machiavellianism also had significant direct effects on ethical and social responsibility judgements. Originality/value - The paper provides insights into the decision processes used to justify aggressive tax minimisation strategies. The findings indicate that commonly articulated views toward corporate ethics and social responsibility may be used to support unethical strategies. In particular, the finding that the stockholder view mediates the relationship between Machiavellianism and ethical/social responsibility judgements suggests that the stockholder view may be adopted to rationalise overly aggressive tax avoidance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Hong Kong; Political theory; Tax planning",

Results supported our contention that multinational enterprises (MNEs) need to be substantially committed to social performance objectives if they are to recoup the cost of their CSP investments, and improve their capacity to compete in foreign markets. MNEs engaged in intermediate levels of CSP achieve lower levels of multinationality than firms operating at either anchor of the social performance continuum.

This paper shows that employers have established informal relational contracts that, in combination with formal contracts, reduce the threat of opportunism while simultaneously allowing a certain amount of control over the worker. We highlight the fact that a hierarchal structure returns to the relationship between worker and employer through the mechanisms of control and dependency.

On this model, achieving a high level of capability largely depends on managerial ability to effectively bargain with stakeholders and establish solidarity vis-à-vis the successful negotiation, implementation, and execution of ""win-win"" transactional exchanges. Against this account, it is rightly pointed out that a transactional explanation of stakeholder relationships, regarded by many as the bottom line for stakeholder management, fails to provide managerial direction regarding how to resolve a variety of normative stakeholder claims that resist commoditization. In response to this issue, this paper has two overlapping goals. It seeks to elaborate a discourse theoretical approach to the problem by first drawing out Jurgen Habermas' theory of communicative action and delineating the various types of rational discourse. Second, the paper attempts to present concrete implications for SMC relative to reshaping the contours of rational, process, and transactional analysis in light of central discourse theoretical conclusions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Communicative action; Critical theory; Discourse ethics; Stakeholder management capability; Stakeholder management theory",

Resource-based models of competitive strategy do not explicitly embrace a particular economic paradigm, but to the extent their conceptualization rests on neoclassical assumptions such as imperfect factor markets and profits as rents, these models also imply a trade-off between competitive advantage and corporate social responsibility. Differences in Austrian/evolutionary economic model's assumptions about equilibrium, profits, and other economic concepts allow this paradigm to embrace alternative views of strategy such as the activities or dynamic capabilities views. These alternative views of strategy focus on learning and adaptation; they align more easily with corporate social responsibility. In practice this alignment comes about because social engagement facilitates the learning and adaptation that are a source of competitive advantage.

However, results comparing the ethical decision-making of balanced thinking managers and nonlinear thinking managers were generally inconsistent across the ethics vignettes.

This paper aims to take the CSR from the viewpoints of a believing system, Christianity in an attempt to bridge a gap in the existing literature. Design/methodology/approach - Through related literature reviews, research questions asked and grounding in the Christians' sacred text, the author seek to explore the Christians' social responsibilities and their relatedness to the CSR. Findings - This paper highlights the interlocking principles - honoring God, one's neighbor, God's creation, great commissions and eternality concept - that shape the Christians' fundamental approaches toward their social responsibilities. These collective faith driven principles would redefine the existing CSR conceptions in a refined form that the author call a faith-based CSR. Practical implications - The paper discusses the applications of the faith-based CSR in the areas of corporate philanthropy, environmental preservation and social reporting. The faith-based CSR is inherently beneficial to the firms and their stakeholders. It refines the organizational paradigms on the business competition, and uncovers a corporate sustainability paradigm otherwise hidden to managers and scholars. Originality/value - The Christians have significant presence in both developed and emerging nations. Their worldviews on the social responsibility, consequently, would have influenced the CSR practices of firms. Given the scant attentions paid to explore the intersection between a believing system and the business ethics, this paper can make a unique contribution to the area of CSR literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Christianity; Competitive advantage; Corporate social responsibility",

We start by explaining how some of these companies have violated the human rights of Chinese citizens to freely trade information. We then analyze whether the justifications and excuses offered by these companies are sufficient to absolve them of moral responsibility. We argue that both justifications and excuses offered are insufficient.

Drawing upon the concept of governmentality, the case study data are analysed in order to understand how and why the self-management programme hampered the exercise of employee voice in the social accounting cycle. The paper suggests that neo-liberal forms of government, such as self-management, can align employer and employee interests in a way that marginalizes the impact of social accounting from an employee perspective. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

One view holds that elements of Chinese culture tend to encourage unethical business decisions. Another perspective says that China has business ethics issues because its economy is in transition. The unclear rules of the game create opportunity for business ethics problems. The large amount of new wealth creates incentive to cut corners to get rich. Thus China, perhaps more than more developed economies, is seen as having business ethics problems. However, good business ethics help a society as a whole, and some say that good ethics can be a source of competitive advantage for an organization. Steps can be taken to improve Chinese business ethics at the societal level, at the individual level, and, importantly for this paper, at the organizational level. In addition to ethical leadership, we believe that one key to improving ethics at the organizational level is human resource management.

In this article, we examine one common form of internet fraud, the practice of shill bidding (when a seller in an auction enters a bid on his or her own item). The significant incidence of shill bidding on eBay (in spite of the fact that it is illegal just as it is in live auctions) exemplifies the current ineffectiveness of regulatory means as well as the lack of effective societal mechanisms to prevent online fraud. Further, the proliferation of shill bidding along with other types of internet fraud may have broader implications. If unethical behavior such as shill bidding becomes too widespread on the internet, regulators and other societal forces may deem it necessary to institute controls that will impact the entire online marketplace as well as the future development and regulation of business activities on the internet. Our results indicate that shill bidding is perpetrated on eBay significantly more often than 0.1% rate of fraud estimated by the firm. This suggests that regulators, users, and others stakeholders may become concerned enough to act. The impact of those responses on the internet of the future may affect a broad array of users beyond the unethical sellers on eBay. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Internet fraud; Online auctions; Shill bidding",

To test this hypothesis, we use data from a survey of 3,000 Missouri farmers with farm sales in excess of $10,000 in 2005 in which farmers were asked how acceptable they considered various unethical or questionable farming practices. The survey also contained questions designed to measure perceived economic pressures. We find evidence that economic pressures result in a greater willingness of farmers to tolerate unethical conduct, particularly in the case of actions that have the potential of causing harm or that are influenced by law or contract.

Voluntary reporting has been characterised by a dearth of neutral and objective information such that the advocates of SEER recommend that it be made compulsory. Their underlying rationale is that legally specified disclosure requirements and enforcement mechanisms will enhance the quality of such reporting. This paper sets out to explore how realistic this scenario actually is, in view of the conflicting interpretations in the literature on this subject. To that end, a survey of the reporting patterns of 78 of the largest Spanish companies between 2001 and 2003 examines the extent of their compliance with the ICAC-2002 standard, which obliged them to make environmental disclosures in their financial statements. The results suggest that progressive and improved regulation could increase the volume and quality of SEER disclosures. They also suggest, however, that persistent non-compliance means that the problems associated with voluntary disclosure still exist. Finally, through an impression management perspective, the study reveals, the diverse strategies, ranging from dismissal to concealment, that are employed by companies to avoid transparency. As regulation improves and enforcement expectations rise, it becomes more difficult to dismiss compulsory reporting norms. As a result, some firms engage in more complex concealment strategies to attain corporate legitimacy, depriving stakeholders of regulatory information. The latter point serves to reconcile apparently contradictory explanations in the literature as to whether legitimacy theory might explain partial compliance with SEER regulation. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accountability; Business ethics; Ethical and environmental reporting; Mandatory environmental disclosure; Social; Spain",

In the presented article it has been made a review of the classical parameters repeatedly used in past literature and that is used in the selection of suppliers and its classical forms of evaluation. Then the article examines some of the characteristics of global supplier markets. When these global markets are examined, companies have to deal with these non-standard parameters in order to select the suitable possible suppliers before start the negotiation process.

For many, results have been disappointing. There are charges that supposedly new organisational approaches remain embedded in managerialist, functionalist and anti-dialogic frameworks that are a significant part of the problem. Similarly the technocratic scientization of public policy is viewed as ill-equipped to deal with the social, economic and ecological issues currently facing neo-liberal societies. In this paper we seek to interpret these frustrations and identify pathways that move beyond this. Specifically, we argue that the gap between sustainability rhetoric and sustainability practices can be reconceptualised through the practice of science as post-normal and through developing the notion of post-normal sustainability technologies (PNSTs). The exponents of post-normal science show why stakeholder engagement in sustainability (and other scientific) issues is critical for the legitimacy and quality of decisions and the admission of complexity in decision-making and accountability processes. Building on this now well-established foundation we seek to characterise, and give examples of, PNSTs as tools for achieving this participation; wherein stakeholders assume expertise and interact with those possessing more traditional forms of expertise in order to co-produce knowledge about sustainability. Recognition of ideological and value diversity is also central to the post-normal sustainability agenda and with PNSTs, the values-based nature of the issues involved is articulated in a way that seeks to bring politics openly into the picture. To this end we identify processes that are emerging in the literature and in practice that will enable PNSTs. These include extended peer communities and multi-actor heuristics, agonistic processes and new characterisations of citizenship that support moves to sustainability. In so doing, we believe that PNSTs offer ""clumsy solutions"" for ""wicked problems"" that can be engaged with in both the research and practice arenas as significant contributions to addressing urgent needs. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Kohlberg's (1971, in Cognitive Development and Epistemology (Academic Press, New York), 1976, in Moral Development and Behavior: Theory and Research and Social Issues (Holt, Rienhart and Winston, New York)) cognitive moral development (CMD) theory is one explanation of moral reasoning. One unresolved debate on the topic of CMD is the charge that Kohlbergian-type CMD theory is gender biased. This research puts forth the proposal that the issue may be elucidated by exposing an ambiguity in ""gender"" (Borna and White: 2003, Journal of Business Ethics 47, 89-99; Gentile: 1993, Psychological Science 4(2), 120-122; Unger: 1979, American Psychologist 34(11), 1085-1094). We use the Sociomoral Reflective Objective Measure (SROM) to measure CMD and the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) to measure gender as a psychosocial concept, rather than as a biological classification. The results of our study indicate that high femininity, measured as a psychosocial attribute, is associated with significantly lower Kohlbergian-type CMD scores among business practitioners. Sex moderates the effect of gender on CMD, but only indirectly. Our research also reveals that education plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between gender and moral reasoning.

In particular, we explicate three ideas that parallel key concepts in BTF: (1) accumulating stakeholder commitments under goal ambiguity (in line with a political conception of goals), (2) achieving control (as opposed to managing expectations) through non-predictive strategies, and (3) predominately exaptive (rather than adaptive) orientation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This survey asked students to respond to four scenarios with potentially unethical business behavior and a string of questions related to the importance of ethics in business strategy and in personal behaviors. Based on arguments related to differences in recent historical experiences, the authors suggest that student responses may be as different within the East Asian (Confucian) environment as they are between this environment as a whole and the USA. Survey results indicate a greater perception of ethical problems and more importance placed on ethics per se in business practices, as well as less of an emphasis on social harmony (a key distinguishing characteristic of Confucian values identified in prior research) on the part of USA students. At the same time, substantial national differences in response are also witnessed within the set of East Asian students. A priori expectations as to the manner in which these East Asian responses should vary based on differences in recent historical experiences are partially, but not fully, supported. The authors argue that the key value of the reported research rests on a demonstration that national differences within a common cultural (e.g., East Asian or Confucian) area can be as great as differences across cultural (East vs. West) areas and that practitioners of global business must fine-tune their expectations as to acceptable business and personal actions to accommodate specific national historical experiences to be effective. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Confucianism",

The excess equity investment is gauged with respect to industry average. The abnormal equity investment is specifically referred to the number of nominal investment companies that are fully controlled by the controlling owners while subject to little governance. Our empirical evidences of 345 Taiwanese non-financial listed firms show that firm's excess and abnormal equity investments are negatively correlated with controlling shareholder's cash flow rights while are positively correlated with the control-cash flow deviation, and board affiliation. The results are supportive of the positive incentive hypothesis and the negative entrenchment hypothesis put forth by La Porta et al. (2002, Journal of Finance 57, 1147-1171) and Claessen et al. (2002, Journal of Finance 57, 2741-2742). The negative relation between equity investment and firm's value further supports the agency postulation that corporate excess and abnormal equity investments represent a leeway for controlling shareholder to exploit wealth of minority shareholders. This study potentially contributes to the literature of business ethics by portraying an empirically testable linkage from controlling owner's ethical choices to his actions and therefore firm's value. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate equity investment; Corporate governance; Ethical choices; Negative entrenchment ypothesis; Positive incentive hypothesis",

Such perspectives developed in contrast to the neoclassical economic paradigm of a rational actor isolated from his/her social and cultural context, as well as to sociological functionalism, which sees economic action as heavily determined by values and social-structural factors. The general idea behind these perspectives is that economic action is always shaped by institutions rooted in history, and by the structures of social relationships in which economic actors are embedded; with the consequence that the former cannot be explained without including the latter in the explanation. This article shows how this perspective is shared by the 'comparative political economy' approach, which developed starting in the 1970s especially in Western Europe, and the 'new economic sociology' approach, which developed a decade later in the United States. After reviewing the main features of both approaches, the article shows how Italian economic sociology has built a relevant research tradition. More specifically, it reviews the main contributions that this 'school' has given to our understanding of how modern capitalist societies work, especially regarding labour markets, welfare systems, local economies and industrial relations. The lack of a strong dominant and unifying paradigm has often been seen as a weakness of Italian economic sociology, as well as of economic sociology tout court. Yet this weakness has to some extent been turned into an advantage, since Italian economic sociologists have been more willing to cooperate with scholars in other disciplines and sub-disciplines and have also been more interested in entering new territories, from both a theoretical and a substantive point of view. © The Author 2008.

This paper examines those responses that indicated that their company possessed a code of ethics. The paper finds that business ethics has continued to evolve and that, in most cases, such evolution has been positive.

This can lead to a misdiagnosis of the causes of contemporary business problems. Teaching business ethics can, however, be ineffectual and counter-productive. Education in ethical philosophy can lead managers to be indecisive, sceptical or to rationalize poor conduct. The ethics of academics become salient and lapses in them undercut their claims to authority. The philosophical viewpoint that stresses free choice runs contrary to the social science mission to reveal the causes that determine human behaviour and provide solutions to problems.

No one appears to have tried to explain the phenomenon known as 'business ethics' and the ways that we as a society interact with the concept, therefore, the authors have addressed this gap in the literature by proposing a model of business ethics that the authors hope will stimulate debate. The business ethics model consists of three principal components (i.e. expectations, perceptions and evaluations) that are interconnected by five sub-components (i.e. society expects; organizational values, norms and beliefs; outcomes; society evaluates; and reconnection). The introduced model makes a contribution to the creation of a conceptual framework for business ethics. A few tentative conclusions may be drawn from the introduced model of business ethics. The model aspires to be highly dynamic. The ultimate outcome is dependent upon the evolution of time and contexts. It is also dependent upon and provides reference to the behaviours and perceptions of people. The model proposes business ethics to be a continuous and an iterative process. There is no actual end of the process, but a constant reconnection to the initiation of successive process iterations of the business ethics model. The principals and sub-components of the model construct the dynamics of this continuous process. They provide guidance on what and how to explore our common efforts to understand the phenomenon known as business ethics.

Most of these models do not include a role for law in ethical decision-making, or if law is mentioned, it is set as a boundary constraint, exogenous to the decision process. However, many decision models in business ethics are based on cognitive moral development theory, in which the law is thought to be the external referent of individuals at the level of cognitive development that most people have achieved. Other theoretical bases of ethical decision models, social learning, and experientialism, also imply a role for law that is rarely made explicit.

Now they are known as leaders. In the past there were habits, commercial customs. Today these are called business ethics. Leadership and business ethics have existed in their present, modern sense, for only four decades, period during which they succeeded in accumulating a vast scientific and casuistic set of instruments. However, constant changes require an active attitude. Ethics is a domain which can be improved. So is leadership. The connection between these two domains creates a certain type of leader, the ethic leader. Somewhere in the future, although it's hard to predict the exact moment, this association must become pleonastic. A business leader must implicitly be an honest person, with strong principles, which manages the organization's resources in a responsible manner, taking into account all the stakeholders. In order to become an ethic leader, it is necessary to adopt some of the practices stated in this paper. The enumeration isn't exhaustive, but they can provide an opportunity for the leader to promote ethics within the firm. The effects of adopting an ethic behavior can be observed in time. This is why some of the leaders prefer to invest in other areas, which produce faster results. The bet on ethics can be won only through patience, perseverance and support from the leaders.","Business ethics; Excellence; Leadership; Management; Stakeholders",

The analysis tries to evaluate the true utility of real estate agents' services and to assess the potential negative effects of an unethical behavior for the clients. In Romanian real estate market, there are at least three issues that endanger the business ethics of intermediaries. First, as the prices increase very fast, the transactions involve larger and larger amounts of money that attract entrepreneurs with weak intrinsic ethical standards. Very often, they fail to understand the instrumental value of business ethics too. Thus, instead of building a reputation in the market they prefer an immediate gain. Secondly, the real estate brokerage is poorly regulated in Romania. According to the motto "" if not forbidden, it's permitted"" , the real estate agents adopted very lax ethical standards. The third factor is the deficit of public information regarding the real estate market and the activity of real estate agents. The press usually reproduces the views of leading real estate agents, instead of providing authentic investigations of their services. The main conclusion is that there is evidence that the Romanian real estate agents try to maximize their profits by manipulating the economic environment rather than providing valuable services for their clients.","Business ethics; Moral hazard; Real estate agent; Rent-seeking; Reservation price",

The western society has evolved towards a well-stabilized theory of ethics in the last centuries, but in the meantime, the same socitey has developed a pregnant material tendency and has adopted consumerism as a new religion. The social development in the two mentioned spheres has led to a series of important dilemmas and contradictions, that not only persist, but seem to be accentuated in the globalization era. The most concerning problems appeared in the Asian contries, where the utilitarian views put in practice have caused the individial's rights and interests to be totally neglected. Asia may have appeared as a huge opportunity for the western companies in the '70, especially for the cheap labour force and the economico-political environment, but nowadays the oriental countries are transformed into a debateful ethical area, where 10-year old children are forced to work in unhuman conditions.

It is argued that recent corporate scandals have set a new low for the accounting profession. It is, after all, the accountants who have assisted in financial management, prepared financial statements and audited these statements. As a corollary to this, it can be argued that accountants play a significant role in good corporate governance and ethical sustainable business practices. Increasingly there are calls for greater transparency and corporate governance as well as increased adoption of professional and ethical practices by businesses. Is this possible given our inherently materialistic nature of accumulating wealth? The question must therefore be asked, if new or additional legislation would not work, what will? It has also been argued that poor quality professional education is one of the problems contributing to these scandals. This paper identifies and explores five factors that seemingly influences and contributes to the perpetuation of accounting and corporate scandals because of their impact on ethical behaviour. Also discussed in this paper is the debate related to the inadequacy of university curricula particularly with regard to the influence of ethics education on accounting graduates. To investigate further these issues, we surveyed students to ascertain whether they believe education can influence ethical behaviour. The findings from the surveys could not conclusively indicate that students perceived ethics education to have a significant influence on their ethical behaviour but nonetheless they believed that it was still important to have ethics education in their programme of study. This finding, in itself, suggests that it is still possible to influence the 'thinking' of accounting graduates before they entered the complex world of business. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The best decision, say virtue ethicists in the Aristotelian tradition, is often one that is made by a person of good character who knows the salient facts of the case and can frame the situation appropriately. In this respect ethical decisions and strategic decisions are similar. Rationality plays a role in good ethical decision-making, but virtue ethicists emphasize the importance of intuitions and emotions as well. Virtue ethics suggests a reconciliation of the factual and the normative. Virtues may explain as well as justify actions. The same is true of other psychological states and events. That psychological terms have normative implications does not render them useless in explanation. As Aristotle does not distinguish cleanly between the normative and empirical, so many moral philosophers today reject the is-ought dichotomy. They are prepared to learn from economists, psychologists, and other empirical scientists who offer information about the nature of the good life and of values. Social psychologists who study community or corporate culture suggest a close relationship between organizational and ethical features, much as Aristotle saw a close relationship between politics and ethics. We should infer from all this that in business ethics there is good reason for philosophers and organization scholars to work closely together. © 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

This paper reviews some of the purported benefits and potential risks of at-home HIV testing, and looks at the way one Canadian company is attempting to address the potential risks. In doing so, this paper brings to the fore concerns regarding corporate involvement in the regulatory approval of biotech products. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biotechnology; Business ethics; Consumer autonomy; HIV testing; Home diagnostics; Marketing; Regulatory capture",

Edward Freeman's argument to the effect that what he calls ""the separation thesis,"" or the idea that business and morality can be separated in certain ways, should be rejected. In this paper, I discuss how this argument should be understood more exactly, and what position ""the separation thesis"" refers to. I suggest that there are actually many interpretations (or versions) of the separation thesis going around, ranging from semantic, empirical and reformative to some which are straightforwardly normative. While it is generally agreed that the separation thesis should be rejected, then, there is not as much agreement on what this thesis actually says. I suggest that whether or not we should reject the separation thesis, however, ultimately must depend on how we understand it more exactly - on certain interpretations, the thesis comes out as more or less trivially false, but we should demand more evidence or argument to reject it on certain other interpretations. This result presents a challenge for all those writers who are committed to the rejection of the separation thesis. © 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly,.",,

Corporations have a responsibility to respect the freedom and human rights of all people, and not to interfere with government programs that ensure people have the education and training they need to find and keep corporate employment and that provide a safety-net that prevents destitution.

We will address this question in part by looking at the possible relevance of a vast literature on individual citizenship that has been produced by political philosophers over the last fifteen years. Some of the central elements of citizenship do not seem to apply straightforwardly to corporations. E.g., ""citizenship"" typically implies membership in a state and an identity akin to national identity; but this connotation of citizenship is obviously problematic for multinational corporations. However, the language of citizenship does help to focus our attention on various legal and political virtues (or vices) for corporations - topics that have been largely neglected by discussions under other rubrics, such as CSR or sustain-ability.

By contrast, lower level employees are more likely to be cynical about the organization's ethics. In order to compare senior managers' and lower level employees' perceptions of ethics in the organization, we surveyed randomly selected senior managers and lower level employees in three firms.

By examining the role of social reporting under a New Governance approach, I set out three necessary requirements for social reporting to be effective: disclosure, dialogue with stakeholders, and the moral development of the corporation. I then assess current social reporting practices against these requirements and find significant problems. In response, I propose one option for solving those problems, and encourage future researchers to consider the demands of these three requirements and the possible trade-offs between them when attempting to find ways to improve social reporting practices. © 2008.

At a minimum, managers are required to protect shareholder's interests when other stakeholders are unaffected by their decision. This ethical imperative has been established in the literature. In cases of conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders, the board of directors of the firm has an ethical obligation to shareholders. The structure of the board can affect its ability to fulfill this obligation. Two specific cases where managerial actions have been argued to be unethical are the adoption of classified boards and poison pills. In this study, we empirically analyze the role of board structure in protecting shareholder rights in the specific case of antitakeover provisions. We test this question on a sample of firms whose shareholders have voted to remove antitakeover provisions and find that independent, focused boards are more likely to accede to shareholder resolutions than are less independent boards. Board size is also important and related to other board structures. We draw implications of this finding for future research on the ethics of board governance. © 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

There are two fundamental issues associated with this. Firstly, would the introduction of rules have any distributional effect? Secondly, what would be the efficiency cost? In this paper, we explore both questions with reference to a job-security corporate rule. We show that the job-security rule will always produce distributional consequences which are consistent with its objectives. However, whether or not it is a socially desirable policy depends on whether the economy is at an efficient allocation and what motivated the policy. It can be shown that under some conditions, even if the initial allocation is efficient, yet not the socially desirable one, a corporate rule - like the job security one - may produce socially desirable gains. The same can be said in the case where the initial allocation is inefficient even in the presence of competitive markets (due to incompleteness problems). However, these social gains would come at the expense of competitiveness. In an internationally open environment this may offset the initial social gains from this policy. Whether or not this happens would then depend on whether agents have a social dimension to their preferences or not. If they do, their response to the initiative may offset the initial loss of competitiveness. Alternatively, society may face the dilemma whether to remain open to uphold local conceptions of distributive justice © 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Sustainability Reporting should also give consumers the information they need to purchase the most sustainable products available (Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, 2004). This article analyses the driving factors influencing CSR and Sustainability Reporting at seven breweries in the Netherlands. It also gives a better understanding of organizational behaviour with reference to CSR and the reasons breweries have for Sustainability Reporting. The Dutch government has no intention of forcing organizations to publish a sustainability report, since it is trying to diminish the volume of legislation. Rather, the government prefers to rely on the willingness and initiatives of organizations to make CSR a success. In 2006, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs will evaluate the effect of its CSR policy. But is it a success already? During our research, breweries appeared to find CSR more important than Sustainability Reporting. Sustainability reporting is, for most breweries, not the way to reach stakeholders. Most stakeholders have their own means for receiving information e.g. annual reports, meetings, public statements and press releases. Although small breweries think CSR is very important, they feel no pressure from outside to publish a sustainability report. For them it is very complex and expensive to publish a sustainability report. Large breweries feel pressure from many stakeholders to be transparent, but not on a regular basis.

It presents a multi-dimensional view, from the perspectives of corporategovernance, project management, and the development sector, includingnonprofit governance, which substantiates this hypothesis. The hypothesisis further corroborated by ethical normative considerations whose particularintricacy and weight carry perhaps the most fruitful explorations inthese chapters.The book's case study, which follows the course of a major developmentproject carried out over a period of 20 months, has confirmed thehypothesis of the governance gap. The analysis of around 400 exampleshas led to a multi-perspectival understanding of the kinds of problems andopportunities that come into focus once one begins to address governanceissues. Based on this understanding, drawing on the governance rolesframed in organizational theories and on several models developed byscholars at the University of St. Gallen, a solution for bridging this governancegap has been developed, the so-called Project Governance Model.Its application to the experience and understanding gained from this particularproject has proven to be fundamental.The governance gap, which this book has examined, is specific to thefunctioning of development projects in nonprofit organizations or NGOs.That gap has special interest if only because NGOs are in the business,finally, of promoting self-governance among the people with whom theycarry out their projects.Project governance is defined herein as a process-oriented system bywhich projects are strategically directed, integratively managed, and holisticallycontrolled, in an entrepreneurial and ethically reflected way, appropriateto the singular, time-wise limited, interdisciplinary, and complexcontext of projects.Six key responsibilities have been identified. Together, they constituteintegrated modules of the Project Governance Model (and are italicized inthe following paragraphs):System management provides a systemic understanding of the environmentand of influences. This book adapts the St. Gallen ManagementModel to the context of development projects, an application that allowsone to set up a project in the first place. The same system understanding,and the lessons that come from it, allow all of the involved actors, from themanager to the donors and stakeholders, to steer the project in its environmentand to guide it toward specific objectives.The specific tasks of the governance board in directing and controllingthe project and its mission are the subject of mission management.Pursuing the development mission requires sensitivity to what developmentcooperation signifies. True development cooperation is made possibleonly through a discursive and recognition-based approach. The challengesinherent in development cooperation may pose threats to the integrityof the project - and indeed, the case study has identified 130 caseswhich have ethical relevance to that integrity. The study has yielded theneed to resort to a universally valid normative foundation. Such a foundationis proposed in integrity management through an approach which combinesdiscourse ethics and recognition ethics. Such a combined approachallows development actors to understand and explicate integrity challengesto the integrity of the project and its organizational elements, creatingso-called tension-zones between the challenges and the elements themselves.A practical process model illustrates how such integrity challengescan be resolved.Development cooperation ultimately relies on stakeholders. In order togo beyond lip-service to these parties, management tools and managementcommitment are needed. The proposed extended stakeholder managementmodule provides a model with specific focus on the broad identification ofstakeholders and a continuous monitoring of the expectations and claimswhich come to exist between the project and its stakeholders.Risk management allows one to detect risks in an all-inclusive way onceagain through reliance on system understanding. This book has emphasizedin particular the need for strategies capable of responding when risk down-sides occur with all of their troubling and messy consequences, aswell as the need for monitoring risks on the level of project governance.Finally, audit management expands on the audit roles of governance. Insightsderiving from the case study propose that internal audit capabilitiesbe strengthened in development projects and that audit needs are alignedon the governance level.In summary, the proposed model for project governance allows one toclose the governance gap in development projects, which was outlined indetail, and thereby contributes to bridging another gap as well, the famousone between theory and practice. The importance of such project governance,however, does not lie exclusively in its support for a proper implementationof development objectives; project governance as it is presentedhere also becomes an implicit part of the objective of true and systemicallyunderstood development cooperation.",,

This has led to the emergence of two different approaches to operationalising TNC responsibilities for workers' rights in developing countries: codes of conduct and global agreements. Despite the importance of this development, few studies have systematically compared the effects of these two different ways of dealing with workers' rights. This article addresses this gap by analysing how codes of conduct and global agreements both independently and interactively affect workers' rights. We do this based on a qualitative study of the Sri Lankan operations of a Swedish TNC in Sri Lanka, and on interviews with union and NGO representatives actively involved in codes of conduct and global agreements. Our results indicate that global agreements independently address all the aspects included in codes of conduct, while also addressing additional, more process-oriented aspects of workers' rights. Hence, on their own, global agreements seem to comprise the superior approach to promoting workers' rights. Furthermore, our results indicate that promoting codes of conduct has negative interactive effects on global agreements. Based on these results, we argue that the current focus on codes of conduct is counterproductive for the promotion of workers' rights. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Code of conduct; Corporate responsibility; Global agreement; International framework agreement; Labour practice; Non-governmental organisation; Transnational corporation; Union; Workplace democracy",

If consumers are influenced by habit then large corporations and global media can greatly influence consumer choice and create problems of self-control (Ainslie, 1992, Pico Economics: The Strategic Interaction of Successive Motivational States Within the Person, Cambridge University press, Cambridge). In this article, we provide a synthesis and integrated approach to this continuing debate. We provide a more institutional approach to consumer choice based on social conventions, rather than just on individual habits and lapses in self-control. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Global media; Habits; Rationality; Self-control; Self-restraint; Social conventions",

Analyses of a series of qualitative interviews conducted over a 6-month period post-release revealed three global reintegration coping patterns: moving toward successful reintegration, resuming behavioral patterns that preceded incarceration, and reintegrating through withdrawal or isolation. Four key contextual factors that differentiated these three coping patterns were the consistency and extensiveness of social relationships, the nature of social support, and the degree of structural stability (e.g., stable employment and housing). Participants were assigned a Likert scale score (1 for poor rating to 3 for better rating) for their pattern of global reintegration and for their rating on each of the four contextual factors across the longitudinal qualitative interviews. Collectively, these five factors differentiated the prevalence and frequency of substance use, patterns of sexual behavior, and incidence of reincarceration as assessed by a quantitative survey administered 6 months post-release. Poorer ratings on all five contextual indices were related to the use of substances other than marijuana and alcohol. Men with less consistent social relationships reported more sexual partners. However, vaginal or anal sex without a condom was associated with greater social consistency and greater structural stability, possibly due to the presence of a steady main partner. Reincarceration was significantly associated with poorer global reintegration ratings, more negative social support, and less structural stability. These findings highlight the need to consider the role of social and structural support systems in HIV and sexually transmitted infection risk reduction interventions for men after their release from prison. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In attending to issues and debates concerning everyday consumption practices within the domestic sphere, the following discussion suggests an approach that firmly places an understanding on how 'goods' and 'things' are used, lived with and appropriated into everyday life. Drawing on in-depth interviews carried out in the homes of 50 respondents in Greater Manchester, UK, the article develops and complements existing ideas and research in cultural anthropology, consumer studies and, more recently, sociology of consumption, which focus on understanding aspects of the complex relationships that exist between subjects and objects, and how these operate within the boundaries of ordinary, mundane and routine consumption practices. It will be shown that one aspect of this relationship relates to the ways in which 'things' act as the embodiment of meaningful social relations and significant connections between family members, friends and even wider social networks, and offers one way of understanding material culture consumption within the home. This is explored via three observed processes of display, acquisition and appropriation within the home: gift objects as familial obligation; objects as markers of memory; and the commemorative potential of objects.

It is, in effect, ironic in how it balances change with tradition. It makes the new regulation pliable and difficult to see as a step to a state-led approach.There is a resistant trend to unions generally even if recognition cases may vary in terms of employer orientations.This article focuses on such issues by addressing a broader understanding of regulation through an ethnographic case study analysis.

Definitions have traditionally emphasised respect for autonomy and the right to self-determination of the individual. However, the meaning of informed consent and the values on which it is based are grounded in society and the practicalities of social relationships. As society changes, so too do the meaning and practice of informed consent. In this paper, we trace the ways in which the meaning and practice of informed consent has changed over the last 35 years with reference to four qualitative studies of parenting and children in the UK which we have undertaken at different points in our research careers. We focus in particular on the shifting boundaries between the professional and personal, and changing expressions of agency and power in a context of heightened perceptions of risk in everyday life. We also discuss developments in information and communication technologies as a factor in changing both the formal requirements for and the situated practicalities of obtaining informed consent. We conclude by considering the implications for informed consent of both increasing bureaucratic regulation and increasingly sophisticated information and communication technologies and suggest strategies for rethinking and managing 'consent' in qualitative research practice. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For 60 years the hospital has been the preferred site of care. However, the UK caring division of labour is currently undergoing a process of (re)domestication and the provision of home care is increasingly regarded as a 'gold standard' for the organisation of care, in institutional and domestic contexts. In this paper we argue that while 'home care' policies serve a range of professional and political agendas, they contain unacknowledged contradictions and strains, creating challenges for both family and professional carers. The realities of home care are examined through reconceptualising qualitative data generated from three research projects concerned with dying in the community. We argue that, whilst previous work has highlighted the burdens the redomestication of care places upon carers, home care philosophies and policies have led to over-romanticised notions of care which privilege the value of caring relationships without acknowledging the dynamic interaction of such social relationships with the actual work of caring. Moreover, such policy trends have created a nexus of social expectations and obligations for which modern society is unprepared. With reference to both end of life care, and home care more widely, we argue that health care planners and professionals need to think more critically about the way care is delivered. Home is not merely about a physical space, but the social and emotional relationships therein. Good 'home care,' characterised by attention to patient-centred needs and flexible in design and scope, does not have to be located within the private sphere; relationships may actually be maintained and nurtured by enabling people to have a realistic choice of care in an institution. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Following the geographers I argue for re-thinking scale as comprising multiple, overlapping socio-political constructions. The second literature is the equally burgeoning one on business ethics. Combining insights from these sources an attempt is made to discern which scales are involved in the formation of business ethics and 'good practice' environmental behaviour, illustrated here with reference to the transnational cement group, Holcim. I propose an analytical framework which brings scale, ethics, and industrial ecology together and suggest that absence/presence of scalar alignment may explain why many evaluations of local industrial symbiosis projects find in practice that success is elusive, patchy and difficult to sustain, but that on the contrary in some cases positive outcomes give grounds for optimism.

The views and perceptions of the buying staff and the suppliers to a large South African MNC are obtained and discussed. The results indicate that this MNC has a good corporate reputation among both its suppliers (an important stakeholder) and its own buying department. The existence and implementation of formal codes of ethics was found to be a necessary, but not sufficient condition for good ethical practice. Candid relationships with suppliers emerged as a second and important factor. Ethical perceptions of buyers by suppliers are driven by the management of corporate identity, through the elements of ethical standards and candid relationships.

The study focuses particular attention on those diseases which have not yet been fully acknowledged and can, therefore, be considered a socially invisible disease: chronic headache is one of these. Thirty-one life stories were collected from patients attending a specialized headache centre in Northern Italy, and selected in order to include all common varieties of chronic headache. Following the principles of grounded theory, interviews began by adopting a minimal theoretical framework which consisted of asking people how they became aware of the objective (disease), subjective (illness) and social (sickness) aspects of their condition. The analysis highlighted particular points in the patients' life trajectories: first, the biographical disruption that takes place because of the disease; second, how people succeed or fail in identity negotiation, which is vital for developing an acceptable social representation of the disease. Results show that patient's choices follow a vicious circle, where a partial social representation of the disease is produced. People who suffer from chronic headache face a dilemma in social relationships: should they conceal their disease, or make it evident? If they conceal, any possible social representation of the disease is denied, which could lead to carrying the burden of the disease alone, with no social support. On the other hand, making chronic headache visible could result in stigma. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Stakeholder engagement is traditionally seen as corporate responsibility in action. Indeed, in some literatures there exists an assumption that the more an organisation engages with its stakeholders, the more it is responsible. This simple more is better' view of stakeholder engagement belies the true complexity of the relationship between engagement and corporate responsibility. Stakeholder engagement may be understood in a variety of different ways and from a variety of different theoretical perspectives. Stakeholder engagement may or may not involve a moral dimension and, hence, is primarily a morally neutral practice. It is therefore argued that stakeholder engagement must be seen as separate from, but related to, corporate responsibility. A model that reflects the multifaceted relationship between the two constructs is proposed. This model not only allows the coincidence of stakeholder engagement with corporate responsibility, but also allows for the development of the notion of corporate irresponsibility. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate irresponsibility; Corporate responsibility; Human resource management; Social reporting; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder theory",

I show, first, that responsible leadership in a global stakeholder society is a relational and inherently moral phenomenon that cannot be captured in traditional dyadic leader-follower relationships (e.g., to subordinates) or by simply focusing on questions of leadership effectiveness. Business leaders have to deal with moral complexity resulting from a multitude of stakeholder claims and have to build enduring and mutually beneficial relationships with all relevant stakeholders. I contend, second, that in doing so leaders bundle the energy of different constituencies and enable social capital building. Social capital can be understood as actual or potential resources inherent to more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual recognition (Bourdieu 1980). By drawing on network analysis I suggest, third, that responsible leaders weave durable relational structures and ultimately networks of relationships which are rich in ties to otherwise unconnected individuals or groups. Against this background I argue, fourth, that responsible leadership may result in the creation of value networks (Lord and Brown, 2001) of multiple stakeholders, which enhance social capital and thereby contribute to both a sustainable business and the common good. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Leadership ethics; Responsible leadership; Social capital; Stakeholder relationships",

However, those who apply Kant in this way often hold businesses themselves morally accountable, and this conception of collective responsibility contradicts the kind of moral agency that underlies Kant's ethics. A business has neither inclinations nor the capacity to reason, so it lacks the conditions necessary for constraint by the moral law. Instead, corporate policies ought to be understood as analogous to legal constraints. They may encourage or discourage certain actions, but they cannot determine a person's maxim - which for Kant is the focus of moral judgment. Because there is no collective intention apart from any intentions of the individual agents who act as members of the corporation, an organization itself has no moral obligations. This poses a dilemma: either apply the categorical imperative to the actions of particular businesspeople and surrender the notion of collective responsibility, or apply a different moral theory to the actions of businesses themselves. Given the diffusion of responsibility in a bureaucracy, the explanatory usefulness of collective responsibility may force business ethicists to abandon Kant's moral philosophy. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bowie; Categorical imperative; Collective responsibility; Corporate internal decision procedure (CID); Corporate responsibility; Decision procedures; Deontological ethics; Kant; Maxims; Moral agency; Norman; Responsibility",

(Academy of Management Review 22, 853-886; 1997). We use a multi-method, comparative case study of two large-scale sporting event organizing committees, with a particular focus on interviews with managers at three hierarchical levels. We support the positive relationship between number of stakeholder attributes and perceived stakeholder salience. Managers' hierarchical level and role have direct and moderating effects on stakeholder identification and perceived salience. We also found that most stakeholders were definitive, dominant, or dormant types - the other five types were rare. Power has the most important effect on salience, followed by urgency and legitimacy. Based on our case study, we offer several ways to advance the theory of stakeholder identification and salience. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Case study; Interview data; Relationship; Stakeholder; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder theory",

Existing research indicates that this type of governance codes has a limited direct effect on ethical or whistleblowing behaviour whereas whistleblowing policies at the corporate level seem to be more effective. Therefore, evidence on the impact of (inter)national corporate governance codes on the content of corporate whistleblowing policies is important to understand their indirect impact on whistleblowing behaviour. This study analyzes the contents of whistleblowing policies, and parts of corporate codes of conduct and codes of ethics, describing such policies of 56 leading European companies. By classifying the contents in seven categories, an exploratory framework was created. General contents often identified were: applicability to all employees, a group-wide scope and an authoritative tone. The most common general violations to report were breaches of internal policies and external regulations or laws. The more specific violations most frequently mentioned were criminal offences and dangers to health and safety or the environment. Contacts to report to were the direct or indirect supervisors, a compliance officer or a confidential ""hotline"" facility. A confidentiality guarantee was common and anonymous reporting was often possible, though sometimes discouraged. Protection against retaliation is stated by ensuring that retaliation will not happen, prohibiting it or making it punishable. The requirement of good faith was frequently given. Finally, investigation of the report was often guaranteed. Surprisingly little information is given on the treatment of whistleblowers reporting an unfounded complaint in good faith, or reporting a violation they were involved in. The study's findings are most relevant to companies without a whistleblowing policy or those that intend to benchmark their policies, and to pan-European standard setters. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Codes of conduct; Codes of ethics; Compliance; Content; Whistleblowing",

This has not affected the arms industry, however. For, this industry has not been discussed in CSR literature, perhaps because few CSR scholars have questioned this industry's privileged status as an instrument of national sovereignty. But major changes in the organization of political communities call traditional views of sovereignty into question. With these considerations in mind I assess the U.S. arms industry on the basis of CSR requirements regarding the environment, social equity, profitability, and use of political power. I find that this industry fails to meet any of these four CSR requirements. Countering a claim that these failings should not be held against arms manufacturers because their products are crucial to national defense, I contend that many of these companies function not as dutiful agents of a nation-state but as politically powerful entities in their own right. So, I conclude, they should be held responsible for the foreseeable consequences that flow from use of their products. This responsibility should include civil liability and, in cases involving war crimes and violations of human rights, responsibility under international human rights standards. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Arms industry; Corporate social responsibility; Human rights; Liability",

Donaldson applied the social contract tradition of Locke and Rawls to the ethics of management decision-making, and with Dunfee, has advanced this project ever since. Current events suggest that if the field is to remain relevant it needs to return to examining social and economic fairness, and? Rawl's approach to social contracting suggests a way to start. First, however, the field needs to discard the weaker and counterproductive aspects of its Lockean legacy: Locke's hostility to government activism and his indifference with regard to outcomes for the bulk of society. Donaldson's and Dunfee's social contracting approach is not suited to, nor was it designed to, analyze or resolve broad issues of social and economic justice. Their postulated network of communities upon which they rely is problematic in a number of ways, and while they take the legal and political status quo into account, their method does not deal with the historical reality that, as the economic and social environment changes, promoting greater justice requires new and sometimes coercive government interventions. Rawls's work, however, does acknowledge the historically demonstrable necessity of using the power of government to help to achieve desirable social outcomes. While he rejected Mill's methodology, Rawls was inspired by the earlier philosopher's concerns for social justice at a time of major economic change. The field would do well to follow the example of both men in this respect. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Donaldson; Dunfee; Economic justice; Locke; Mill; Rawls; Social contract; Whig",

This assertion requires us to look at the meaning of three words: power, corruption, and democracy. For this reason, the article begins by making a distinction between primary and secondary corruption (essentially, controllable and uncontrollable corruption) and between liberal democracy (emphasizing competitive politics) and classical democracy (emphasizing consensus-building politics). An argument is made for a case study approach (combined with ""ordinary language"" methodology) in analyzing the corruption-democracy linkage, rather than the prevailing quantitative methodology, particularly comparing India and China. Conventional definitions of corruption (e.g., misuse of public resources for private gain) and democracy (emphasizing elections and majority rule) would indicate that China is more corrupt than India. However, judging from a comparison of two cities (Shanghai and Mumbai), this is clearly not the case because of the prevailing secondary corruption in Mumbai. Political Elasticity (PE) Theory is introduced to explain why secondary corruption is so dysfunctional for development. Effective political power (using this theory) takes on ""rubber band"" and ""balloon"" characteristics, facilitating delegation of responsibility and public respect - all of which can be undermined by uncontrollable corruption. This theory is also used (with Russia in mind) to examine Hobbes's position regarding authoritarian rule. At the conclusion, the point is made that, insofar as political power becomes entirely coercive, it will indeed be corruptive, undermining the political software (referring to social relationships) essential for the functioning of institutions, as suggested by Lord Acton. If, however, political power takes a persuasive form, it is unlikely to be so corruptive, especially if it becomes a form of social energy.","China; Corruption; Democracy; Hobbes; India; Lord acton; Political development; Political elasticity theory; Political power; Russia",

This article demonstrates that CSP is institutionalised within the governance structure. We will attempt to make this clear by means of a description of the Dutch system of corporate governance. Under certain circumstances Dutch companies are already bound to CSP due to prevailing legislation. A governance perspective shows that CSP is institutionalised within a company's governance structure. ""Processes of responsiveness"", since long regarded as a starting point of CSP-analysis, appear to be decision-making processes. Within these processes the expectations of the stakeholders can be institutionalised, trust can be built and interests can be incorporated. This makes CSP context-dependent. However, it is possible to analyse companies by comparing the companies' individual governance structures. The article concludes that CSP-analysis can fruitfully extend into analysing in the role of the stakeholders in the influence-pathways that are incorporated within the governance structure. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate governance; Corporate social performance; Stakeholder influence",

The general ideas behind complex systems dynamics and evolution are presented and then two examples are treated in detail. The first in an evolutionary model of a market in which some new product is developed by competing firms and their ""task"" is to find a strategy in terms of quality and price that will be sustainable. This essentially requires agents/firms to discover mutually compatible strategies, and to create thereby sustainable market niches. The second example considers the internal structure of firms, in terms of their constituent working practices and skills. It demonstrates that it is precisely their ignorance of the consequences of adopting any particular practice that generates diversity in the emergent capabilities of firms, exploring the dimension of potential demand and therefore leading to a successful and sustainable business sector. The work supports the notion that the cognitive abilities that are involved are not about deduction and logic, as a traditional view of rationality might suggest, but are about the development and contraction of interpretive frameworks, which will be different for each player. The paper links these examples to a general recognition of the idea that complex, multi-agent systems evolve through successive ""structural attractors""-multi-dimensional dynamical systems-with temporary structural stability. Because real systems contain both the structure and deviations from it, then there is a constant probing of structural stability and the possibility of qualitative change to a new structural attractor. This resembles the ideas in biological evolution related to ""punctuated equilibria,"" but it also links this to the idea of emergent and evolving networks of interaction, never of course near thermodynamic equilibrium. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Cladistics; Co-evolution; Complexity; Interpretive frameworks; Market evolution; Multi-agent modelling; Structural attractors",

Findings - The paper finds that the extant literature in the field of sustainability accounting and reporting, in contrast to the fields of management accounting and management, has largely ignored practice within organisations. The lack of ""engaging research"" is found to be due to concerns about increasing the breadth of participants in the social accounting agenda and ""managerial capture"".

This distinction is of enormous importance for business ethics, since market transactions are governed by the competitive logic of the market, whereas administered transactions are subject to the cooperative norms that govern collective action in a bureaucracy. The widespread failure to distinguish between these two types of transactions, and thus to distinguish between adversarial and non-adversarial relations, has led many business ethicists to develop a ""uniform"" moral code. Yet in market transactions, the checks and balances built into the system of commercial exchange are such as to permit more instrumental forms of behavior. In administered transactions, by contrast, these checks and balances are absent, and thus the institutional context calls for much greater exercise of moral restraint. In this paper, I begin the task of developing an adversarial ethic for business. According to this view, the competitive environment licenses a greater range of ""self-interested"" behavior, but also imposes its own constraints on the strategies that firms may adopt in the pursuit of their interests. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Adversarial ethics; Competition; Corporate social responsibility; Market failure; Philosophy of sport",

We address the theory of ethical decision-making and deontological ethics for business executives and explore the concept of ""moral duty"" as transcending mere gain and profit maximization. Two real-world cases that focus on accounting fraud as the ethical conception. Through these cases, we show that while accounting fraud - from a consequentialist perspective - may appear to provide a quick solution to a pressing problem, longer term effects of fraud and misconduct make ethical implications more apparent. Widely used compensation schemes also may have the tendency to fuel unethical behavior. We argue that an ethical reinvigoration of the business world can only be accomplished by encouraging the business realm to impose upon itself some measure of self-regulating along the lines of deontological ethics. Principles of deontology should guide executive decision-making particularly when executives are tempted to operate outside of codified legislation or are bound to act under judicial-free conditions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Accounting fraud; Business ethics; Consequentialism; Deontological ethics; Utilitarianism",

The first one (Integral Forest Biological Reserve) is of sanctuarist type, therefore incompatible with human activities, while the second one (resulting from the Habitats directive) proceeds of a step of dialogue and does not exclude the human presence. These two situations are interesting because no emblematic species of fauna or of flora is really pointed out, which invites to seek elsewhere the reasons of the conflicts which are spread there, at the base of dynamic particularly structuring for the rural territories. Based on an ethnographic step, the reflexion shows that these conflicts of environment lead the collectives to redefine their relations with the resources and natural spaces and so doing, to adjust the social relationships (made of authority, competition, and/or association) that they maintain the ones with the others. It is shown there that the anthropological nature of the conflicts of environment is due above all to the way in which the collectives take care to ensure their perenniality in space and time. © 2007 Lavoisier.","Conflict; Directing Habitats; Environment; Integral forest biological reserve; Land control; Mounts of pilat; Natural area; Public policies; Territory; The vosges of north; Waste lands",

Policy advice often seeks to modernise trading practices within such markets so as to improve efficiency. However, efforts to improve efficiency could have undesirable consequences if the current functioning of the markets is inadequately understood. In Burkina Faso, the FCFA devaluation in 1994 led to increasing livestock exports and a subsequent meat shortage on the domestic market. Based on market statistics from Burkina Faso and household interviews, the study investigates the status of meat consumption before and up to four years after the devaluation. Results indicate that the price increase for cattle was only transmitted to consumers after a time lag. Meat is more frequently sold in little heaps than on a weight basis. Lower per-kg prices of smaller size heaps imply an income gain for poorer consumers. Butchers use all edible body parts in addition to the carcass (i.e. head, hoofs, intestines) to buffer price fluctuations and to cope with the consumers' notion of a fixed nominal price. This suggests that butchers and their clients are embedded in networks of what [S. Plattner, 1989. Economic behavior in markets. In: Plattner S. (Ed.), Economic anthropology, Stanford, pp. 209-222.] called equilibrating economic relations, which are favoured by the perishable nature of meat. Selling live animals or meat by weight is often considered as a measure to increase transparency within informal markets. However, the introduction of formalized or standardized marketing measures alone, without lowering the transaction costs of other components of the value chain, risks undermining the equilibrating social relationships that play an important role particularly for the poorer market actors, and thereby disadvantaging vulnerable population groups. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this paper is to explicate one aspect of the debate between various attempts of offering a specific method for resolving moral dilemmas. We contrast two kinds of deliberative methods: deliberative methods whose goal is decision-making and deliberative methods that are aimed at gaining edifying perspectives. The decision-making methods assessed include the traditional moral theories like utilitarianism and Kantianism, as well as second order principles, such as principlism and specified principlism. In light of this assessment, we suggest taking a closer look at two perceptive models, casuistry and particularism. These models are used for dealing with moral dilemmas that provide for edifying perspectives rather than decision-making. These perceptive models, though less scientific and not as good at prescribing an action, are more human in the sense that they enrich our moral sensibilities and enhance our understanding of the meaning of the situation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Casuistry; Decision theory; Humanism; Moral deliberation; Particularism",

Second, the study examines factors affecting a person's ethical perspectives. Understanding the factors which shape the ethical standards of future accountants will help educational institutions develop appropriate ethics curriculum and help firms develop appropriate ethics training for their employees. Failure to bring appropriate ethical standards to the workplace will most assuredly hamper the profession's time-honored commitment to serve the public interest.

Overall, we find no significant difference - even for a specific ""accounting tricks"" vignette, which resembles the Enron and WorldCom situations. We do find, however, that the practitioners were more accepting of vignettes that involved physical harm (PH) to individuals and those that were legal (but ethically questionable). We postulate that accounting practitioners may apply a legalistic framework to their assessment of the acceptability of each vignette.

A hierarchical stakeholder model of guanxi is developed drawing upon Mitchell et al.'s (1997) stakeholder salience theory and Anderson's (1982) constituency theory. As an application of instrumental stakeholder theory, the model dimensionalizes the notion of stakeholder salience, and distinguishes between and among internal and external guanxi, core, major, and peripheral guanxi, and primary and secondary guanxi stakeholders. Guanxi management principles are developed based on a hierarchy of guanxi priorities and management specializations.

Ghanaian marine waters are part of an upwelling system with strong seasonal and inter-annual variability. Much of this variability is forced at large spatial scales in the tropical Atlantic and by El Niño-Southern Oscillation events in the Pacific Ocean, which influence inter-annual variability of sea surface temperature and pelagic fish landings off Ghana. At decadal scales, Ghanaian marine waters experienced cool sea temperatures and low fishery landings during the 1960s, rapid warming and increases in fishery landings during the late 1970s and 1980s, and variable temperatures and fishery landings during the 1990s. In the late 1990s, pelagic and demersal fish populations appeared to be declining, partly due to over-fishing, although the per capita supply (domestic production plus net imports) of fish was kept high by increased imports. Artisanal fishers and fishing communities in Ghana have devised strategies to deal with variability on seasonal and inter-annual scales. These livelihood strategies include: (i) exploiting marine and terrestrial natural resources more intensively, initially at local scales but expanding to regional scales; (ii) ensuring multiple and diversified income sources; (iii) investing in social relationships and communities for support; and (iv) undertaking seasonal or permanent migrations. In addition, the national government imports fish to deal with shortages. However, these strategies may be less adapted to variability at decadal scales, and may not be sustainable when viewed at the larger scales of environmental change.

In this paper, we consider the ethical and economic context that existed and facilitated Andersen's failure. Our analysis is grounded in Akerlof's (1970, Quarterly Journal of Economics August, 488-500) Theory of the Market for Lemons and we characterize the market for audit reports as a market for lemons. Consistent with Akerlof's model, we consider the appropriateness of the countervailing mechanisms that existed at the time of Andersen's demise that appeared to have effectively failed in counteracting Andersen's ethical shortcomings. Finally, we assess the appropriateness of the remedies proposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOA) to ensure that similar ethical lapses will not occur in the future. Our analysis indicates that the SOA regulatory reforms should counteract some of the necessary conditions of the Lemons Model, and thereby mitigate the likelihood of audit failures. However, we contend that the effectiveness of the SOA critically depends upon the focus and attention of the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) towards assessing the ethical climates of public accounting firms.

The unique method used to select socially responsible investments is then provided that also includes a description of the quantitative techniques employed in the analyses. Results are offered subsequently, and the close describes implications for global enterprises as socially responsible investments. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Corporate social responsibility; Global investments",

Growing tired of what are, in their eyes, inefficient and unproductive cross-sectoral partnerships, firms are starting to form post-cross-sectoral partnerships (post-partnerships') open exclusively to corporations. This paper examines one such post-partnership project, the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), to analyse the possibility of post-partnerships establishing stable definitions of corporate responsibility'. We do this by creating a theoretical framework based on actor-network theory (ANT) and institutional theory. Using this framework, we show that post-partnerships suffer from the paradox of striving to marginalise those stakeholders whose support they need for establishing stable definitions of corporate responsibility'. We conclude by discussing whether or not post-partnership strategies, despite this paradox, can be expected to establish stable definitions of corporate responsibility'. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Actor-network theory (ANT); Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI); Codes of conduct; Corporate responsibility; Garment industry; Institutional theory; Partnership; Supplier relations",

Unfortunately, several features of federal criminal law and federal law enforcement policy have driven a wedge into this alignment, forcing managers to choose between their ethical obligations and their obligation to obey the law or aid law enforcement. In this article, I examine the nature and implications of the growing divergence between managers' ethical and legal obligations. After describing the traditional approach to business ethics analysis, I identify the features of federal criminal law and law enforcement policy that are responsible for the divergence and show how they are undermining the efficacy of the traditional approach. I illustrate this effect with the issue of workplace confidentiality. I then argue that the traditional approach must be reformed to give explicit recognition to the legal dimension of normative analysis, and demonstrate how such a reformed approach would function by applying it to three illustrative issues - organizational justice, privacy, and ethical auditing - and supplying a case study - KPMG's allegedly abusive tax shelters. © 2007.

In order to overcome the methodological deficiencies most prior papers suffered from, we use performance measurement approaches in the spirit of Carhart (1997, Journal of Finance 52(1): 57-82) and Ferson and Schadt (1996, Journal of Finance 51(2): 425-461). In doing so, we investigate the aggregated performance and investment style of ethical and conventional mutual funds and allow for time variation in the funds' systematic risk.

In particular, the control cultivated by ethics programs may weaken employees' ability and motivation to exercise their own moral judgment, especially in novel situations. We develop this argument first by examining how organization theorists analyze control as an instrument of management coordination, and by addressing the political implications of control. We discuss coercive and enabling control as variations that help account for the distinction between compliance-based ethics programs and values-based ethics programs. We then explore three potential drawbacks of ethics programs: the specter of indoctrination, a politicization of ethics, and an atrophy of competence.

We found, however, an unexpected, positive feature of decoupling in the study of a local government; namely, when organizational members engage in discussions that turn away from the letter of an ethics code they often do so to address higher ethical principles embedded in the spirit of the code. The decoupled understanding of the code in these cases becomes a symbolic, legitimating gesture grounded not in strict provisions but in creative and complex interactions. This counterintuitive explanation of decoupling capitalizes on discourse that evolves from a legalistic interpretation to rich discussions that value the multiplicity of voices within organizational life. What follows is that ethical decision making emerges as creative, dynamic, and responsive to its constituents. © 2007. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

The legal discussion examines disclosure regulations, employment restrictions, bribery laws, and anti-fraud provisions as each applies to the lobbying context. The analysis demonstrates that given the social value placed on the First Amendment, federal law generally affords lobbyists wide latitude in determining who, what, when, where, and how to lobby. The article then turns to ethics. Lobbying involves deliberate attempts to effect changes in the law. An argument is advanced that because law implicates the use of force and because law ideally reflects the values of a democratic society, seeking to slant the law to serve a client's narrow interests cannot provide an adequate ethical end for a lobbyist. On the contrary, a lobbyist has an affirmative moral duty to seek reasonably balanced and just laws. The article examines, refines, and defends this proposition in a number of settings. © 2007.

In this article, we argue that viewing loyalty as a cognitive phenomenon - an attitude that resides in the mind of the individual - helps to clarify definitional inconsistencies, provides a finer-grained analysis of the concept, and sheds additional light on the ethical implications of loyalty in organizations. Specifically, we adopt the psychological contract perspective to analyze loyalty's cognitive dimensions, and treat loyalty as an individual-level construction of perceived reciprocal obligations. Based upon this perspective, we present a three-tiered framework of loyalty that provides a psychologically informed definition of the concept, specifies the variety of obligation types that loyalty can imply, and anticipates the potential for asymmetrical loyalty configurations between employers and employees. We use the framework to articulate moral issues associated with both symmetrical and asymmetrical loyalty configurations and discuss the implications of the framework for theory and practice. © 2007.

We examine the association between executive compensation and corporate social responsibility (CSR) for 77 Canadian firms using three key components of executives' compensation structure: salary, bonus, and stock options. Similar to prior research (McGuire, J., S. Dow and K. Argheyd: 2003, Journal of Business Ethics 45(4), 341-359), we measure three different aspects of CSR, which include Total CSR as well as CSR Strengths and CSR Weaknesses.

The approaches are based on two simple models of how different societal spheres interact with one another and influence long-term economic performance. These models allow exploring the idea that corporations can influence trajectories of societal change-keeping in mind that pension funds care about these trajectories because they care about the long-term performance of the economies in which they invest. The model underlying the internalising investor approach assumes that corporations are the only actors in society. In this model, pension funds will maximise their expected ability to meet their liabilities if companies internalise negative externalities and spill-over effects in order to reduce the cost of market failures for the economy as a whole. The model underlying the civic investor approach comprises companies and various actors (the state, NGOs, corporate stakeholders) engaged in shaping the governance structure that mediates the interaction between the social, environmental and economic spheres. In this model, pension funds will want companies to facilitate effective responses to societal problems. These approaches allow us to identify a number of corporate behaviours that should be of concern to pension funds. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This paper seeks to rectify this shortcoming by advocating a close reading of the so-called ""great books,"" beginning the process by focusing on Aristotle. The Nichomachean Ethics and The Politics points to Aristotle's emphasis on tying business morality to a universal conception of the good life. This conception defines personal happiness to chiefly consist in practicing the virtues, a life in which both desire and the pursuit of wealth is kept under check. According to Aristotle, virtue reaches its height with the exercise of the intellectual virtues of prudence and wisdom - the first manifest in the leadership of organizations, and the second in the philosophic search for truth.

Bobek: 2004, Accounting, Organizations and Society 29(5-6), 565-590] and its role in responsibly managing the natural environment [Newton, L.: 2005, Business Ethics and the Natural Environment (Blackwell Publishing, Oxford)]. When studied together, researchers often examine if, and how, corporations influence environmental policy decisions. Drawing from literatures on corporate political ativite corporate social and environmental performance, and corporate environmental disclosure, we develop and empirically examine two research questions concerning the relations between corporate political expenditures, environmental performance, and environmental disclosure. The questions are: (1) Do corporations that are poorer environmental performers spend more on political activities than their better-performing counterparts? (2) Is there an association between corporations' spending on political activities and the extent of their financial report environmental disclosures? We investigated these questions through analyses of data we gathered on a sample consisting of 119 U.S. environmentally sensitive firms for the 2001-2002 election cycle. After controlling for firm size and specific industry effects, our tests reveal a significant, inverse relationship between firm environmental performance and political spending. This is consistent with the notion that U.S. firms with relatively poorer environmental performance records engage more intensely in corporate political activities as part of their overall strategic management of their relationship with the state. In addition, a significant and positive association between the amount of political spending and the extent of environmental disclosure suggests that environmental disclosure and political spending are both proactive, complementary tactics to strategically manage public policy pressure. If corporations' strategies are intentionally designed to unreasonably limit their environmental responsibilities or to misrepresent firm environmental performance, then we argue that these activities reflect a significant lapse in ethical conduct. © Springer 2006.","Business ethics; Corporate political strategy; Environmental disclosure; Environmental performance; Political expenditures",

These have not only threatened the position of many senior corporate managers but also the financial survival of some of the companies over which they preside. Some authors have attributed these scandals to the pre-eminence of a focus on increasing shareholder value in Western business schools and/or to their failure to inculcate ethical standards. In this paper, we challenge these accounts and the aetiological view of knowledge from which they derive but are grateful for the consensus that they convey regarding the importance of business ethics.

The argument advanced in this paper is that the use of ecological metaphors has been partial and selective. In key areas of theorisation such as industrial ecology the selective use of ecological metaphors has generated theoretical and empirical bias. In turn, this means that both our understanding of sustainability and our ability to create policy for the attainment of sustainability are, at best, partial. A different selection of ecological metaphors can result in different implications for our understanding of sustainable business and the limitations of such metaphors to the attainment of sustainability. To illustrate this view, this paper explores the latent possibilities in ecological concepts such as diversity, local adaptation, and alien species invasion as they might be applied to business and economic analysis.

In addition to examining the final recommendations of these bodies, it is also important to ensure fairness in decision making. Accountability for reasonableness is an ethics-based framework for examining the fairness of priority setting processes. The objective of this study was to assess the fairness of four internationally established centralized drug review processes using accountability for reasonableness. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with stakeholders in Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the UK ( n = 1 6). Participants were asked to evaluate their country's centralized drug review process against the four conditions of accountability for reasonableness. Each centralized drug review process satisfied at least one of the four ethical conditions, but none satisfied all four conditions. All participants viewed transparency as critical to both the legitimacy and fairness of centralized drug review processes. Additional strides need to be made in each of the four countries under study to improve the fairness of their centralized drug review processes. Ideally, a fair priority setting process should foster constructive stakeholder engagement and enhance the legitimacy of decisions made in assessing pharmaceutical products for funding. As policy makers are under increasing scrutiny in allocating limited resources, fair process should be seen as a critical component of such activity.

Three perspectives on local forest relations, two well established and one emergent, are identified. The local perspective accords analytical priority to micro-level processes and emphasizes local factors as the primary influences on local forest relations. The political perspective emphasizes the contested nature of property in forest, linking local contestations to the effects of larger political forces, in particular states. The third, emergent perspective is agrarian, situating local forest relations at the intersection of local-level processes and larger economic and political forces.

Yet while looking for an appropriate standard, they often base their decisions on cost-benefit calculations, thus neglecting other important spheres of influence pertaining to more broadly defined stakeholder interests. We argue in this paper that, as a part of the strategic decision for a certain standard, management needs to identify and act according to the needs of all stakeholders. We contend that the creation of a dialogical understanding among affected stakeholders cannot be a mere outcome of applying certain accountability standards, but rather must be a necessary precondition for their use. This requires a stakeholder dialogue prior to making a choice. We outline such a discursive decision framework for accountability standards based on the Habermasian concept of communicative action and, in the final section, apply our conceptual framework to one of the most prominent accountability tools (AA 1000). © Springer 2006.","Accountability standards; Discourse ethics; Habermas; Organizational accountability; Stakeholder dialogue; Stakeholder management",

These cases emphasize the importance of ethics driving accountants' decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses these ethical lapses in light of applying Kohlberg's models, biblical examples from the Old and New Testaments and the Koran, and other ethical systems. Findings - The paper shows that this concept is not new. Throughout history, people have taken actions that cost themtheir freedom, their money and most importantly, their good names. Upon reflection,many of these people are astounded at the seriousness of their action given what little they had to gain from continued involvement. In reinforcing lessons that should be learned from cases of business malfeasance and highlighting many well-known accounting and other scandals, we develop recurrent themes in the nature of business scandals and showthatmany people are responsible for or complicit in themalfeasance. Individuals could have prevented the fraud or minimized any adverse impact if they had considered their behavior ex ante. We show that the employees portrayed demonstrated very low-levels of ethical development and seemed to underestimate the probability of getting caught and the resulting punishment. We also elicit many reasons from several viewpoints for not becoming involved in fraud. Research limitations/implications - It is hoped that the next generation of business leaders and middle level staff alike will consider the results/messages of this paper when faced with ethical dilemmas. Practical implications - The paper concludes that the best internal control in a business structure remains the hiring and training of morally upstanding employees and managers who recognize the values of their good names before temptations arise.

The study questionnaire comprised closed-ended items of parent/school relationships and risk behaviors based on the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Survey. In regression analyses, female students who perceived low parental social support were significantly more likely to report engaging in all risk behaviors examined, and female students with perceptions of low school social cohesion were more likely to report suicidal ideation, binge drinking, and drug use. Perceptions of parental social support and school social cohesion held fewer but still significant associations across risk behaviors for male students. Male students who reported low parental social support were significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation, drug use and physical fighting, while male students with low perceived school social cohesion were more likely to report physical fighting but less likely to report binge drinking.

Such an approach is offered in the re-conceptualisation of ethical action on the part of leaders as a process of ""coming into right relation"" vis-à-vis those affected by their decisions and actions. Heidegger's notion of ""dwelling"" is explored as a means of ""coming into right relation"". Three aspects of dwelling: ""staying with"", ""comportment"" and ""active engagement"" are described and ways in which they might be practically enacted by leaders are suggested.

Jones claimed that moral intensity, which is ""the extent of issue-related moral imperative in a situation"" (p. 372), consists of six characteristics: magnitude of consequences (MC), social consensus (SC), probability of effect (PE), temporal immediacy (TI), proximity (PX), and concentration of effect (CE). This article reports the findings of two studies that analyzed the factor structure of moral intensity, operationalized by a 12-item Perceived Moral Intensity Scale (PMIS) adapted from the work of Singhapakdi et al. [1996, Journal of Business Research, 36, 245-255) and Prey [2000 Journal of Business Ethics, 26, 181-1951]. The two items that were purported to measure CE were dropped due to their inability to effectively tap into the characteristic proposed by Jones. Factor analyses of the remaining 10 items supported a 3-factor structure, with the MC, PE, and TI items loading on the first factor, the PX items loading on the second factor, and the SC items loading on the third factor.

A number of areas have been identified for students to use as topics for research projects in management ethics. These ranged from Biblical and classical times to the present day. Some were drawn from sources that were less well known e.g. the De consolatione philosphiae 'The Consolation of Philosophy' by Boethius 524 AD. This was chosen partly for its ethical content, but also because Boethius was magister officiorum i.e. head of the civil service. Aelfred the Great (849-899) King of Wessex (he who burnt those cakes) was chosen because he promoted the intellectual, moral and spiritual qualities that were to serve as guidelines for his executives. Nineteenth century literature (Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope and Galsworthy) was also chosen as a source of topics for research projects in business ethics.

Theories as disparate as stockholder and stakeholder theory both leave this central assumption unchallenged. Each theory argues for a different set of external ethical restrictions, but neither adequately provides an internal connection between business and the ethical rules business people are obliged to follow. This paper attempts to make this connection by arguing that the purpose of business is to produce a good or service for trade. Trade involves both a respect for individual autonomy and property rights and squarely places moral norms internal to the practice of business. Trade is not a contingent activity of business, it is a practice rule which also provides the common sense boundary between business and charity on the one hand, and crime on the other. Business and those who engage in it are, from the internal point of view, bound by the purpose of trade and not just the laws of the land. © Springer 2006.","Business ethics; Internal point of view; Internalism; Practice rules; Purpose",

As a result, a plethora of studies have examined the relationship between gender and business ethics. However, these studies report conflicting results as to whether or not men and women differ with regards to business ethics. In this article, we propose that gender identity theory [Spence: 1993, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 64, 624-635], provides both the theory and empirical measures to explore the influence of psychological gender traits and gender-role attitudes on ethical perceptions of workplace behaviors. Statistical analyses of the data reveal that based on sex alone, no differences occur between men and women in their ethical perceptions. Yet, when a multidimensional approach to gender is applied, results show that expressive traits and egalitarian gender-role attitudes contribute to both men's and women's propensity to perceive unethical workplace behaviors as unethical.

This paper focuses on the least researched of the relationships among these three actors, the union-NGO relationship, by analysing the ways in which it affects definitions of TNC responsibility for workers' rights at their suppliers' factories. Based on a qualitative study of the union-NGO relationship in the Swedish garment industry between 1996 and 2005, we propose that there are six main configurations of union-NGO relationships. By linking these configurations to their effects on TNC responsibility, we propose that co-ordination relationships between unions and NGOs, particularly high-commitment co-ordination relationships, are likely to result in a broadening of the definition of TNC responsibility, while conflictual relationships, both high and low commitment, result in a narrowing of the definition of TNC responsibility. The study indicates that co-operation is generally more beneficial for both unions and NGOs than is any form of conflictual relationship, in terms of broadening the definition of TNC responsibility. © Springer 2006.","Clean clothes campaign; Corporate responsibility; Garment industry; Labour practice; Multinational corporation; Non-governmental organisation; Supplier relation; Transnational corporation; Union",

This phenomenon assumes concrete form in relation to specific geographical and historical conditions. One such set of conditions is investigated here under the rubric of the creative field, i.e. the locationally-differentiated web of production activities and associated social relationships that shapes patterns of entrepreneurship and innovation in the new economy. The creative field operates at many different levels of scale, but I argue that the urban and regional scale is of special interest and significance. Accordingly, I go on to describe how the creative field functions as a site of (a) entrepreneurial behavior and new firm formation, (b) technical and organizational change, and (c) the symbolic elaboration and re-elaboration of cultural products. All of these activities are deeply structured by relations of spatial-cum-organizational proximity and separation in the system of production. The creative field, however, is far from being a fully self-organizing entity, and it is susceptible to various kinds of breakdowns and distortions. Several policy issues raised by these problems are examined. The paper ends by addressing the question as to whether industrial agglomeration is an effect of producers' search for creative synergies, or whether such synergies are themselves simply a contingent outcome of agglomeration. © Springer 2006.",,

Conventional accounting rhetoric suggests that the bottom line represents appropriate business transactions, successful performance, and a basic ""stewardship contract"" fulfilled, and recent debates regarding ""earnings management"" lament the affront of these obligations.

Comparison is made with three similar conventional funds whose investment objectives remained unchanged. Analysis techniques employed in previous studies find similar results: mean risk-adjusted performance is unchanged by the switch to SRI, with no evidence of over-or under-performance relative to the benchmark market index by any of the four funds. More interestingly, changes in variability of returns over time are also modelled using generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models, not previously applied to SRI funds so far as is known. Results show a temporary increase in variability of returns, followed by a return to previous levels after around 4 years. Evidence shows the increased variability to be associated with the adoption of SRI rather than with a change in fund management. Possible explanations for the subsequent reduction in variability include the spread of corporate social responsibility activities by firms and learning by fund managers.

In a first empirical step, the literature-based framework has been operationalized for the business world by analyzing sustainability reports. In a second empirical step, the operationalized framework served as the basis for a survey of selected MNCs.

Design/methodology/approach – Within the stakeholder relationship marketing model holistic marketing performance is reflected in the delivery of long-term economic, social, and environmental value to customer, employee, supplier, community, and shareholder stakeholders of a business in order to enhance sustainable financial performance. Stakeholder relationship marketing performance is measured in a stakeholder performance appraisal. The applicability of the Western stakeholder relationship marketing model in the Chinese context is tested by undertaking stakeholder performance appraisals on two Chinese businesses. Findings – Results show that the performance of the two Chinese businesses is in line with the 57 Western businesses in the Future Research Group stakeholder performance appraisal benchmark database, and that the stakeholder relationship marketing model is applicable to the Chinese context both philosophically and practically. Research limitations/implications – The results can be considered as an indicative evaluation of stakeholder relationship marketing in China as a foundation for definitive validation from planned research on more Chinese businesses. Practical implications – The stakeholder performance appraisal provides Chinese businesses with a perceptual overview of holistic marketing performance and concomitant business financial performance from stakeholders. These data enable Chinese businesses, like their Western counterparts, to plan stakeholder relationship marketing strategies to enhance marketing performance and to predict future financial performance. Originality/value – This study extends the newly developed stakeholder relationship marketing model from a Western context to the Chinese context and demonstrates the congruence between Western and Chinese holistic business philosophy. © 2006, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, All rights Reserved.","Business analysis; China; Relationship marketing; Stakeholder analysis",

Prevailing authors appeal to ""transcendent"" values (deontology), skepticism (there is no loyalty), or Aristotelianism (loyalty is seeking mutual self-interest). I argue that the ""Aristotelian"" view clears up the ""egoist"" difficulty with loyalty. Briefly, critics feel we must ""transcend,"" ""replace,"" ""overcome"" and most especially sacrifice self-interest on the altar of ethics and loyalty. I argue that few things can be more ethical than loyalty to shared values. When a company and I both pursue the same value X, there becomes no difference between my seeking my best interest and my seeking the best interest of the company (and vice versa). Hence, the way out of the egoist difficulty with loyalty is seeing a company's interests as my own (Aristotle's third stage of friendship). © Springer 2006.","Aristotle; Deontology; Egoism; Egoist; Loyalty; Self-interest; Virtue ethics",

J. (1999), Journal of Business Ethics 19, 193-206, dealing with issues of code of conduct of marketing educators. Sirgy developed a discussion document outlining a semblance of what might be construed as a code of ethics for marketing educators. The discussion document was debated and accompanied by three commentaries (Ferrell, O. C.: 1999, Journal of Business Ethics 19, 225-228; Kurtz, D.

One conclusion derived from the discussion document and the commentaries is the need to develop a code of ethics involving behaviors that most marketing educators find morally unacceptable. The current paper reports on a descriptive study involving a survey of marketing educators in which survey respondents were asked to rate the extent to which certain behaviors are deemed acceptable or unacceptable. The results of the survey identified certain behaviors deemed unacceptable by the vast majority of survey respondents. This evidence of hypernorms (a concept derived from social contract theory) within the community of marketing educators was used to propose an initial code of ethics. © Springer 2006.","Academic ethics; Code of ethics; Marketing educators; Marketing faculty",

In particular, the paper examines the ways in which codes of conduct coordinate the expectations of relevant parties with regard to the provision of assistance by MNCs on grounds of rescue or justice. The paper argues that this coordinative role of codes of conduct renders MNCs more accountable for the performance of actions specified in a code of conduct than they would be without a code of conduct. This interpretation of the significance of codes of conduct is contrasted with the view that codes of conduct render MNCs accountable for performing actions specified in a code of conduct by grounding contractual obligations for the performance of such actions. © 2006.

The extractive resource industry is presented as an arena where conditions for corruption - monopoly and discretion without accountability - are especially intense. Corruption is maintained by a self-reinforcing cycle. Multiple stakeholders are involved in the maintenance of and/or opposition to the cycle: investing corporations, host country regimes and officials, inter-governmental bodies like the OECD, industry associations, non-governmental organization (NGO) watchdogs like Transparency International, and international agencies facilitating global investment like the World Bank. Complementarity of interests between the demand and supply sides provides strong incentives for entrenched players to maintain corruptive relationships, to protect past gains and sustain current ones. Compulsory international regulation, maximum transparency, effective detection, and enforcement are recommended to enhance accountability, thereby reversing the cycle. It is also necessary to create a corporate culture built on integrity, if regulation itself is to succeed. © 2006. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

But there are threats as well as opportunities, since anti-branding and free-riding activities are easier in cyberspace. One such threat is the unauthorized incorporation of a trademark into a domain name. This can lead to trademark dilution and cause consumer confusion. But some users claim a right to use these trademarks for the purpose of parody or criticism. Underlying these trademark, conflicts is the familiar tension between property rights and free speech rights. While some trademark scholars are reluctant to consider a trademark as property, we find strong support for the property paradigm in Hegel's philosophy. Assuming that a trademark is an earned property right, we propose that a trademark owner should be allowed to control the permutations of its trademark incorporated into domain names unless a reasonable person would not confuse that domain name with the company's mark. But we also conclude that there must be latitude to employ a domain name for negative editorial comment, so long as the source and purpose of that domain name is plainly apparent. © 2006.

Improving multinational enterprises' (MNEs) ethical conduct is a factor of both the ability of firms to change behaviors in the direction of the moral good, and their willingness to do so. Constraints and enablers of a firm's ability to act ethically emanate from the external environment, including, the industry environment of which the firm is a resident, and the host country environment in which it operates. A firm's willingness to engage in ethical conduct is determined by the effective bundling of internal resources and the commitment of those resources to social ends. The interaction of external and internal conditions carves out categories of expected firm behaviors and suggests interventions that would push these behaviors in a more positive ethical direction. With reference to integrative social contracts theory (ISCT), these categories of firms are examined, and a conceptual model for analysis is developed to explain the drivers of corporate choices in the adoption and implementation of codes of conduct, and the relative power of relevant communities to the process. © 2006.

It is based on a survey of the 500 largest companies in these nations. The findings reveal many similarities between these countries. Among other things, it emerges that most companies give consideration to ethics in business and have adopted some kind of formal or informal ethical policies. Regardless of whether or not they have a CES, companies agree that ethical conduct must be taken into account when selecting, appraising and promoting personnel as an important ethical policy. There is a growing tendency to draw up formal corporate ethics documents. These documents are perceived, first and foremost, as supporting the development of corporate culture. Most respondents believe that primary responsibility for ethical issues in the company rests with the CEO. Finally, the findings indicate that most companies that devote more resources to communicating and implementing CESs have two or more formal ethics documents. The main differences between the countries included in the study concern the emphasis given to specific aspects, such as avoiding misconduct or taking ethical criteria into account when selecting personnel. The emphasis is greatest in countries where corruption seems most prevalent. © Springer 2006.","Argentina; Brazil; Business ethics policy; Codes of conduct; Institutionalization of business ethics; Spain; Values statement",

The key public policy issue regarding privacy is whether the US should follow its current self-regulation course (where the FTC encourages websites to obtain private ""privacy web-seals""), or whether a European style formal legal regulation approach should be adopted in the US. We conclude that the use of assurance seals has worked reasonably well and websites should be free to decide whether they have a privacy seal or not. Given the narrow scope and the wide variety among these seals, we do argue that the seals should commit themselves to the key features of a good privacy policy and that an opt-in provision be required.

Provided the human rights obligations of multinational corporations are interpreted as moral obligations specifically tailored to the situation of multinational corporations, this could serve to bring powerful moral force to bear on MNCs and could provide a legitimating basis for NGO monitoring and persuasion. Approached in this way the human rights obligations of MNCs can be taken to include support for political as well as economic rights. This will go some way towards filling the regulatory gap created by the difficulty of controlling the activities of corporations operating globally. However, such a proposal will require a measure of 'meta-regulation' whereby the operations of MNCs are legally required to be sufficiently transparent to create the conditions for effective external moral scrutiny. © 2006.

Using data from the European Social Survey (22 countries, N=42,358), this study suggests that, rather than having a contextual influence on health, the beneficial properties of social capital can be found at the individual level. Individual levels of social trust and civic participation were strongly associated with self-rated health. At the same time, the aggregate social trust and civic participation variables at the national level were not related to people's subjective health after controlling for compositional differences in socio-demographics. Despite the absence of a main contextual effect, the current study found a more complex cross-level interaction for social capital. Trusting and socially active individuals more often report good or very good health in countries with high levels of social capital than individuals with lower levels of trust and civic participation, but are less likely to do so in countries with low levels of social capital. This suggests that social capital does not uniformly benefit individuals living in the same community or society. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is based on videotaped nurse-adult patient interactions in clinics in the area of Southern California. Detailed examination of co-participants' naturally situated weighing conduct shows that parties recurrently deliver utterances that go beyond that required to accomplish weight measurement-precisely ""where"" they ""are"" within the weighing process shaping how they produce and understand these utterances. Using weighing as a locus of epistemic negotiation and potential affiliation, co-participants interactionally achieve the distribution of weight/weighing knowledge and the character of their social relationship. Confronting their numerical weight results in a social/medical setting, patients can use expansive weighing utterances to claim or demonstrate that they possess pre-existing knowledge regarding weight, asserting independent expertise vis-à-vis nurses and claiming result co-recipiency and co-ownership. Speakers can also use expansive utterances to proffer an interactional opportunity for affiliation, inviting recipients to collaborate in producing a more personalized encounter.

The past decade has witnessed the popularization of two intertwined trends in geographic competitiveness: Globalization and localization. While previous research has sought to understand and analyse how multinational enterprises pursue strategies to capture critical expertise and resources in dynamic regional environments, to date only limited efforts have sought to explore how internationalization affects 'cluster' relationships among locally founded, rapidly growing firms. Specifically, this paper explores whether the internationalization of local firms weakens the local relationships associated with industrial clusters. It reports the findings of research conducted on the internationalization of a cluster of companies in the photonics industry. Twenty-three senior executives were interviewed, face-to-face. Grounded theory methodology was applied to the data to create a new conceptual framework to explore how internationalization impacts the embedded social relationships of locally established firms. The findings suggest that, as firms internationalize, intimate local relationships become less significant. As local companies mature and their sales and markets expand, they develop new capabilities and operations. Firms pursuing strategies to develop capabilities outside their home region gain access to outside resources and, in turn, elect to reorient their level of intra- vs. inter-cluster interaction. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Clusters; Internationalization; Relationship-networks","globalization; industrial location; regional economy"

This study engaged a uniquely high-risk group of HIV-infected mothers as expert informants on childbearing with HIV to inform strategies to eradicate perinatal HIV transmission. The sample draws from an Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) database of 1104 HIV-seropositive women with children in protective services between 1989 and 2001. Of these, 32 women knew their HIV-positive status and gave birth to at least two children after 1997 (zidovudine widely implemented as standard of care). Twelve were accessible and consented to participate. Three others, currently pregnant, also participated. Fifteen interviews were completed. The 15 women had given birth to 78 children (9 HIV-infected), fathered by 62 men. Respondents were severely socioeconomically marginalized. They were aware of their HIV status and the benefits of prophylaxis, most desired healthy babies to parent, and most delivered their babies in hospitals equipped to provide adequate prophylaxis. Yet most received inadequate or no prenatal care and did not disclose their HIV status at delivery. Women indicated that denial and substance use were the primary intrinsic barriers and disrespectful treatment was the primary extrinsic barrier to disclosure and care. Women's recommendations about eradication of perinatal HIV transmission emphasized the problem of substance use, the need for private and thorough communication with medical and DCFS personnel, and the need for positive social relationships to enable HIV positive mothers to engage in care. Attention to potent social and institutional barriers that impair the ability of the most marginalized women to disclose their HIV status and accept care is essential to realize eradication of perinatal transmission. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The point about the erosion of agency is deepened in the discussion of a case study which illustrates the difficulty of identifying even the bare ""ownership"" of actions within organizations.

The effort towards CSR engagement in the tobacco industry is not only heavily criticized by anti-tobacco NGOs. Some opponents such as the the World Health Organization have even categorically questioned the possibility of social responsibility in the tobacco industry. The paper will demonstrate that the deep distrust towards tobacco companies is linked to the lethal character of their products and the dubious behavior of their representatives in recent decades. As a result, tobacco companies are not in the CSR business in the strict sense. Key aspects of mainstream CSR theory and practice such as corporate philanthropy, stakeholder collaboration, CSR reporting and self-regulation, are demonstrated to be ineffective or even counterproductive in the tobacco industry. Building upon the terminology used in the leadership literature, the paper proposes to differentiate between transactional and transformational CSR arguing that tobacco companies can only operate on a transactional level. As a consequence, corporate responsibility in the tobacco industry is based upon a much thinner approach to CSR and has to be conceptualized with a focus on transactional integrity across the tobacco supply chain. © Springer 2005.","Corporate philanthropy; CSR; Integrity; Organizational legitimacy; The common good; Tobacco industry; Transactional CSR; Transformational CSR",

In this article the difficult case of Myanmar is considered. Ruled for decades by a closed and sometimes brutal military elite, the country has long been subject to informal and formal sanctions. However, as sanctions have failed to trigger political reform, it is necessary to review the policy options. The focus here is on the contribution socially responsible corporations might make to change. The article sketches contextual features of the case, examines the recent history and present pattern of business links with Myanmar, and assesses whether current approaches can stimulate reform. Concluding that they cannot, it considers fresh possibilities for corporate engagement. The argument is that socially responsible corporations, committed to improving individual life chances through engagement with developing societies, should undertake collaborative and principled direct investment in Myanmar. The underlying strategy and problems of codification and implementation are all analyzed. To close, the article contends that, by doing business with Myanmar's rights violating regime, multinational corporations can extend the frontiers of global corporate social responsibility. © Springer 2005.","Burma; Business ethics; Constructive engagement; Corporate social responsibility; Foreign direct investment; Multinational corporations; Myanmar; Sanctions; Socially responsible investment",

Design/methodology/approach - A critical theory methodology for identifying and describing administrative evil is outlined. Findings - Administrative evil refers to the use of technology, professionals, and hierarchical organizational structures in ways that divorce collective actions from their moral context. The role of technical accounting expertise, manifested as various devices, facilitates ""ordinary"" human beings' ""rational"" participation in ""administrative evil"" through a series of technically competent and instrumentally rational decisions, facilitated by information technology. Research limitations/implications - Divorcing actions from their moral context removes a sense of personal responsibility and accountability on the part of the organizational participants and renders public interest considerations captive to prevailing ideology and social structures. Practical implications - By better understanding the facilitating processes of administrative evil, possibly one can begin to develop alternative criteria that empower individuals to circumvent the negative consequences of instrumental rationality and enable them to act more responsibly in the public interest. Originality/value - Critical theory is used in better understanding administrative evil and in developing strategies for change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accounting; Business ethics; Management accountability; Work organization",

It describes the so-called SD-SRM perspective as a distinctive research approach and shows how it relates to the wider body of stakeholder theory. Next, the concept of SD is operationalized for the microeconomic level with reference to important documents. Based on the ensuing SD framework, it is shown how SD and SRM relate to each other, and how the two concepts relate to other popular concepts such as Corporate Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility.

Through a CSR framework which was developed in an exploratory study, we explore the nature of stakeholder relationships reported across leading FTSE companies and the importance they attach to communicating both social and business outcomes. It is evident from the hypotheses tested that the bigger FTSE companies, particularly extraction companies and telecoms, are more adept at identifying and prioritising their stakeholders, and linking CSR programmes to business and social outcomes. However, we draw the general conclusion that building stronger stakeholder relationships through CSR programmes - other than with customers - is not currently a priority for most companies. We also conclude that a limited sophistication in managing multiple stakeholders may compromise the impact of CSR upon business and social results.

The ethical argumentation used in these business situations was examined in relation to three ethical theories: utilitarian ethics, deontology and virtue-ethics.

Given that reputational indices tend to reflect the financial performance of organizations above other factors (Fryxell, G. E. and J.

To this end, we introduce interaction weights between pupils in the same school class that are a function of exogenous individual background characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, and having older siblings. The resulting model with endogenous interactions and school-specific fixed effects is estimated using data from the Dutch National School Youth Survey (NSYS), a survey in which, in principle, all pupils in a sampled class are interviewed. By combining the 1992, 1996, 1999, and 2001 NSYS data, we are able to identify trends in social relationships of teenagers. We find that the roles that gender and ethnicity play in how teenagers interact varies strongly across different types of behaviour. For example, 'going out' shows strong within-ethnicity interactions, while expenditures on cell phones and on clothing exhibit mainly between-girls interactions. Having older siblings has a minor effect on within-school-class social interactions.

One instrumental function of literature is to imitate life, thereby expanding our vision beyond our parochial interests; to see literature merely as a didactic instrument to serve business interests misses the point that literature should expand understanding, our sense of what in addition to business is interesting and valuable. © Springer 2005.","Enron; Ethical criticism; Literature; Moral imagination; Narrative",

The poorest experience clusters of interlocking disadvantage that make it highly unlikely that they can draw on social capital to ameliorate their poverty, or that increased association and participation at community level is necessarily beneficial to them. Moreover, social relationships, collective action, and local institutions may structurally reproduce the exclusion of the poorest. As such, a politically neutral and undersocialized policy focus on strengthening associational life and public participation of the poor is unlikely to lead to their greater inclusion, nor to significant poverty alleviation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This robust approach offers a convenient analytical framework that can be used to simulate agents' actions, reactions and interactions. The approach also provides an environment where strategies or multi-stakeholder forest management scenarios can be developed and analyzed.

These financial models were further developed to produce a Mixed Integer Programming-Sustainable Forest Management (MIP-SFM) model, in which principles of sustainable forest management were incorporated into the harvest scheduling process. The effectiveness and practicality of the harvest schedules produced by the financial model and the MIP-SFM model were compared to the harvest schedules produced by the process currently employed by Coillte (The Irish Forestry Board). Evaluation of the models was carried out in Clonbrock forest (294.8 ha), a typical Irish plantation forest, owned and managed by Coillte. The MIP-SFM model produced effective and practical harvest schedules that enhanced the sustainability of Clonbrock forest by incorporating environmental, ecological and social management parameters. The application of the developed MIP-SFM model resulted in an increase in NPV of 5.7% compared to the NPV produced by the scheduling process currently employed by Coillte. The application of the financial model had resulted in a comparable increase in NPV of 14.2%.

This paper presents the findings from a qualitative study with 40 Australian mothers of children under school age. The research aimed to understand the tensions, dilemmas and trade-offs which women experience around physical activity within the contexts of their everyday lives as mothers of young children. The analysis shows that, in contrast to health promotion messages which frame physical activity as a positive and healthy behaviour, mothers of young children perceive activity as being both enhancing and threatening to their health and social relationships. Restrictive stereotypes of the 'good' mother make it difficult for many women to prioritise their own physical activity needs over their childrearing and domestic responsibilities. Nevertheless, women's involvement in physical activity is often underpinned by the maternal 'ethic of care' as something which can help them cope better with the challenges of being a mother and contribute to the wellbeing of the family. This article takes as its departure point the notion that the maternal 'ethic of care' creates previously unrecognised opportunities in relation to physical activity. For many mothers, physical activity can also be a way of challenging hegemonic discourses and extending what it means to be a good mother in contemporary society. Although largely overlooked by contemporary health promotion, it is women's family-oriented politicism and resistance to dominant meanings about motherhood, health and the 'ideal' body which create alternative possibilities for their participation and enjoyment of physical activity during early motherhood. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The basic material was gathered from four case mills and their surroundings in four countries: China, Finland, Germany and Portugal. The stakeholders in the case companies determined the priorities among the acceptability criteria by means of pairwise comparisons, after which a prioritisation function, i.e. the weights on the criteria, was estimated using regression techniques. The resulting stakeholders' valuations were compared cross-culturally and intra-culturally. Technical, financial and environmental issues were perceived as the most relevant elements of the acceptability of operations, and thus of corporate social performance. Despite the common elements identified, the present findings indicated that the concept of the acceptability of operations varies from place to place. It was obvious that national and company culture influenced the elements that were emphasised at a particular time, although all background factors could not be studied statistically in the present context.

To address this gap in the ethics education literature the present study examines the influence of an underlying social cognitive error, called pluralistic ignorance. We believe that if pluralistic ignorance is reduced, the result will be more effective business ethics education programs. Eighty undergraduate management students participated in this longitudinal study, and a mixed-model ANOVA revealed that the reduction of pluralistic ignorance (due to an ethics education program designed to reduce pluralistic ignorance) resulted in higher personal ethical standards over the course of a semester, when compared to a class that did not receive a formal ethics education program as part of their course.

Therefore, the association between chronic medical illness and mental distress was analysed, taking into account the modifying effects of generic disease characteristics (concerning course, control and possible stressful consequences), physical quality of life indicators and social and relationship problems. Panel data from the Dutch national Panel of Patients with a Chronic Disease (PPCZ) were used. Data from 1788 chronically medical ill patients (nine disease categories) concerning their mental and physical health have been used in a cross-sectional, multivariate analysis. Somatic disease, generic disease characteristics and physical quality of life were assessed by medical doctors. Mental distress and social/ relationship problems were assessed by questionnaire (respectively, GHQ-12 and Biopro). Members of the panel had more mental distress than a random community sample. However, there were no differences between specific somatic diseases. Relationship, job-related and financial problems increased the probability of mental disorder considerably. Relationship problems may be considered a generic characteristic of chronically ill patients, causing an increased risk of mental disorder. Poor physical health condition contributed to a higher probability of mental disorder as well. General practitioners, home care providers and medical specialists should be aware that people with chronic diseases are in general more at risk of mental disorder. For many chronically ill people, this risk is further exacerbated by social/relationship problems, and a poor level of perceived health. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The argument is based on the observation that the debate on ""corporate citizenship"" (CC) has only paid limited attention to the actual notion of citizenship. Where it has been discussed, authors have either largely left the concept of CC unquestioned, or applied rather uni-dimensional and decontextualized notions of citizenship to the corporate sphere. The paper opens with a critical discussion of a major contribution to the CC literature, the work of Logsdon and Wood (Wood and Logsdon 2001; Logsdon and Wood 2002). It continues with a consideration of the nature and role of metaphors for business and of the contestable nature of the political concept of citizenship. It evaluates corporations as citizens through a four-dimensional framework of democratic citizenship offered by Stokes (2002). The analysis suggests that corporations do not easily fit the ""liberal minimalist"" model of citizenship. It finds, however some possibilities for fit with the three more participatory models. The paper concludes by cautioning against basing corporate citizenship on legal and administrative status or identity, and mapping out specific criteria by which we might determine whether corporations could be considered as citizens by virtue of their participation in processes of governance. © 2005.

The authors propose that these constructs can be applied to all stakeholders, rather than just to the current employees of the firm, and that objective determinations of fairness by the managers can be related to subjective perceptions of fairness by the stakeholders that will result in the sequential series of attitudinal, behavioral and numerical changes that will lead to performance improvements.

More recently, these funds have been expanding their investment strategy by considering a corporation's long-term risks on issues such as environmental protection, sustainability, and good corporate citizenship, and how these factors impact a company's long-term performance. Conventional wisdom argues that the fiduciary responsibility of the pension funds' trustees must be solely focused on their beneficiaries and, therefore, their investment criteria must be based strictly on narrowly defined financial measures. It is also asserted that well-established financial measurements of corporate performance already include long-term risk assessment through discounted present value of future flow of earnings. Consequently, all other criteria are contrary to the best interest of the pension funds' beneficiaries. In this paper, we assert that, contrary to conventional wisdom, pension funds, and for that matter other mutual funds, must be concerned with the long-term survival and growth of corporations. These measures are generally referred to ""socially responsible investing'' (SRI) and when applied to corporations, it is termed ""socially responsible corporate conduct (SRCC)."" We demonstrate that current measurement of future risk assessment invariably understates, and quite often completely overlooks, these long-term risks because of the inherent bias towards short-run on the part of financial intermediaries whose compensation depends greatly on short-term results. Furthermore, there is ample evidence to suggest that these intermediaries have been engaging in self-serving practices and thus failing in their duties to serve their clients', i.e. pension funds', best interests. Because of their large holdings in the total market as well as individual companies, these funds cannot easily divest from poorly performing companies without destabilizing the companies' stock and overall markets. Hence, they must opt for a strategy of emphasizing investment criteria that encourage companies to take into account long-term aspects of their operations in terms of their impact on environment, sustainability, and community welfare, to name a few. We argue that an exclusionary, and even a primary, focus on short-term financial criteria is no longer a viable option. It also calls for the pension funds to encourage greater transparency and accountability of the entire corporate sector through improved corporate governance. Thus socially responsible investing practices are not merely discretionary and desirable activities; they are a necessary imperative, which both the corporations and public pension funds, and other large institutional holders, will ignore at serious peril to themselves. Finally, the paper considers some of the recent developments where corporations have been responding to these challenges and how their actions might be strengthened through greater disclosure and transparency of corporate activities. It also makes recommendations for the pension funds to support further research in creating new measurement standards that further refine the concept of socially responsible investing as a necessary ingredient of long-term corporate survival and growth in the context of a changing economic, environmental and socio-political dynamic. © 2005 Springer.","Corporate governance; Financial intermediaries; Free rider; Public goods; Public pension funds; Socially responsible corporate conduct (SRCC); Socially responsible investing (SRI)",

A now almost forgotten answer to this question was advanced at the dawn of capitalism, an answer that students of business ethics would find profit in considering. In the early eighteenth century, Bernard Mandeville authored The Fable of the Bees, which became notorious in its day for arguing that capitalism created wealth while necessarily relying on vicious impulses. The fundamental dilemma is that morality requires self-denial while capitalism runs on self-interest. As such, Mandeville claims that business and ethics are essentially separate. While this would appear to align him with skeptics of business ethics, Mandeville does suggest a role for moral theorists in dealing with the challenges of commercial societies. The Mandevillean business ethicist proceeds by separating the public and private spheres. In the former, where government policy toward business is at issue, the Mandevillean ethicist applies a market-friendly utilitarianism. In the latter, where individual conduct is at issue, the Mandevillean gently articulates a market-critical ethic predicated on self-restraint. © 2005. Business Ethics Quarterly,.",,

Although the mainstream of current thinking in business ethics recognizes that a firm should invest in social responsibility, the normative theory on how specific competitive conditions affect a firm's social responsibility remains underdeveloped. Intensity of competition, risks to reputation and the regulatory environment determine the competitive conditions of a firm. Our central thesis is that differential strength of competition produces differential moral legitimacy of firm behavior. When competition is fierce or weak, different acts or strategies become morally acceptable, as well as economically rational.

Building on previous work (Moore, 2002) in which MacIntyre's notions of practice and institution were explored (MacIntyre, 1985), the paper offers a philosophically based argument in favour of the rediscovery of craftsmanship by those who work in business organisations, and the exercise of craftsmanship in community.

The initial question is whether the main character has different ethical and political obligations, but this leads on to the question to what extent we can distinguish various different categories of obligation. The example may be of special interest because of the importance of close personal relationship in organisational politics, which brings the dirty hands problem together with the question to what extent friendships generate distinctive obligations. However, it is doubtful whether the allocation of obligations to different categories can be sustained in a useful way. It may be that we can put aside loyalty to an organisation, as a consideration which does not generate any distinctive obligation, but balancing other factors against one another may require the sort of judgment that has sometimes been called ""political wisdom,"" and sometimes ""moral imagination."" © 2005.

This study tests the proposition that national culture, top management team culture, and manager's personality influence leadership and shapes intercultural fit through the predominant management style in US-Mexican strategic alliances. Design/methodology/approach - Strategic leadership and personality theories constitute the framework for this study. Managers from the US-Mexican strategic alliances which partners hold an equity position were surveyed and provided data to test the hypotheses. Findings - Findings show that American and Mexican managers construct their own social reality with rules and norms bounded primarily by the existing organizational culture in the alliance. Both managers' management styles are similar and converge into a participative ""consultative"" style emerging as a ""third culture"" characterized by task innovation and emotional concern as American managers' input and task support and social relationships as Mexican managers' contribution. This study suggests that if adequately balanced, individualism-collectivism is a source of intercultural fit while building shared leadership. Practical implications - Managers of international alliances may reconfigure individual and cultural orientations and styles of alliance partners in the design of management teams to build high levels of social effectiveness. The innovator style of American managers supports the dynamics of change for the alliance to advance while the adaptor style of Mexican managers builds stability, order, and maintains group cohesion and cooperation. Originality/value - Intercultural fit in international strategic alliances is achieved through designing organizational cultures that incorporate partners' cognitive diversity into the relationship. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cross-cultural management; Management styles; Mexico; Strategic alliances; United States of America",

Recent case studies and research experiences show that social and environmental targets are more widely recognized as strategic drivers for management. However, experiments also show that the traditional Scorecard has its limits when it comes to e.g. stakeholder management and product chain management. The European Corporate Sustainability Framework (ECSF) program distinguishes several ambition levels for Corporate Sustainability/Corporate Responsibility. The traditional Balanced Scorecard is suitable for companies that aim for Compliance-driven CS/CR or for Profit-driven CS/CR, where the financial bottom line is the ultimate indicator for success. More ambitious companies want to balance economic, social and ecological targets in a Community-driven CS/SR or Synergy-driven CS/CR. For ambitious companies, we propose a format of a Responsive Business Scorecard (RBS). The Responsive Scorecard enables companies to score at Profit, People and Planet, at the same time to integrate stakeholder demands into internal programs to improve performance. The RBS includes five Perspectives: Customers & Suppliers, Financiers & Owners, Society & Planet, Internal Process and Employees & Learning. We assessed the practical feasibility of a Responsive Scorecard in food and tourist industries. In the food industry, we analyzed whether existing business priorities of Italian companies can adequately fill a Responsive scorecard. Our conclusion is that traditional topics like finance, customers and employees are readily filled, but that sustainability topics like chain management (suppliers) and environmental performance (planet) need further elaboration. The tourist sector is dominated by Small and Medium Sized Enterprises. We investigated whether existing eco-labels for camping-sites and marinas can be developed into Responsive Scorecards. Our conclusion is that such a sector specific development of a Responsive Scorecard is possible. Further research has to show what is the value added of the new scorecard for companies in the tourist sector.","Business strategies; Corporate Social Responsibility; Responsive Business Scorecard",

Biological pathways are one important area of current research interest. Using data from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) in Taiwan, we examined relationships between social environment characteristics and an index of cumulative biological dysregulation (""allostatic load,"" AL) in near elderly (NE) (aged 54-70) and elderly Taiwanese (aged 71+). Longitudinal data on levels of social integration and extent of social support were used to predict cumulative AL at the final survey year. Linear regression analyses revealed that among the NE, presence of a spouse between 1996 and 2000 was associated with lower AL in 2000 among men, but not women. Among the elderly, ties with close friends and/or neighbors were found to be significantly related to lower AL for both men and women. Perceived qualities of these social relationships did not show consistent associations with AL. This relatively modest set of significant relationships stands in contrast to somewhat stronger patterns of findings from studies in Western societies. Cross-cultural differences between Western societies and an East Asian society such as Taiwan raise the intriguing possibility that contextual, normative influences on social experience affect the patterns of association between features of these social worlds and the physiological substrates of health. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Seventeen in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with senior managers and clinicians to gain a user perspective and identify specific areas for process refinement. Data were thematically coded and categorised into relevant themes. Results: Key strengths included a culture shift in thinking about the need to reallocate resources within a fixed funding envelope, whereas a key challenge identified was in putting forth genuine disinvestment options. Areas suggested for improvement included evoking an incentive system for stakeholder engagement and having a mechanism for tracking the effect of resource reallocations. Conclusions: Both an evidence-based approach to priority setting, as well as a way of thinking around managing resource scarcity, can be integrated into organisational processes.

The extent to which these recent multi-stakeholder dialogues assume anything resembling the relationship or caring and the learning potentials of dialogic goals and processes suggested by recent advocates, however, can certainly be questioned.

The context is a hostile bid for Blue Circle Industries, a FTSE 100 company, and the focus is upon its Chief Executive Officer's actions in response. CEOs occupy a position of pivotal importance during such takeover bids, and it is salient to examine their resultant motivations and payoffs. While agency theory suggests that CEOs may act in self-interested ways, diverging from the interests of shareholders, ongoing stewardship theory sees CEOs as fundamentally honest and caring about their company and shareholders' interests. The hostile bid is an opportunity for the target CEO to fight at any cost, or to act in the best interests of stakeholders.In examining the target CEO's actions, this article suggests there is more complexity than these two theories acknowledge and the relationship between them is not one of simple opposition.

He argues that their ability to turn knowledge into profits make them crucial for the survival of the firm in the Information Age. Kelley's win-win outcome (making the world a better place) is dependent on the formulation of new rules of engagement and accountability to harness gold-collar knowledge and creativity. By definition, gold-collarism includes accountants and it draws attention to the ""ethics versus profits"" dilemma the profession is embroiled in. The (gold-collared) profession appears to have abandoned its public interest role for a more lucrative one of consulting-partner to the business community despite its presumed impartiality in transforming management's rules of engagement (with multiple stakeholders). Further, its pronouncements on future directions seek to commodify accounting education to produce compliant hegemonic technicians. It should instead seek to formulate ethical accountability by enabling a healthy struggle over ideologies.

However, these are the situations in which management knew that they made the wrong choice. As professor Joseph Badaracco of Harvard Business School points out, the real ethical dilemmas arise when people must choose between right and right - where both choices can be justified, yet one must be chosen over the other. Whether or not to reprice stock options represents one such ethical dilemma. Repricing can help exodus of talented employees and motivate them to improve firm performance. However, it alienates shareholders and other workers of the company who are left unprotected from the adverse economic consequences of a stock price decline. In this paper we examine the ethics and the economics of stock option repricing. We find that repricing runs counter to two key tenets of business ethics - distributive justice and ordinary decency. To examine the economics of repricing, we draw upon agency theory to identify situations where repricing has the potential to benefit shareholders. However, a survey of empirical research reveals that these benefits do not translate into reality. Repricing does not improve employee retention or firm performance. In addition, managers benefit by opportunistically timing the repricing. Due to weaknesses in corporate governance such as lack of independence and conflicts of interest, the current repricing practice seems to be at odds with the objective of shareholder wealth maximization, and at a more fundamental level, a violation of board's fiduciary duty to shareholders. We offer suggestions that mitigate the ethically undesirable effects of repricing in the wider context of prevailing corporate governance and regulatory environment. We believe that these suggestions, if properly implemented, can transform repricing from a greed-inspired evil to a valuable compensation tool to retain employees, boost their morale, and enhance stockholder wealth.","APB 25; Business ethics; Corporate governance; Executive compensation; FASB 123; FASB 144; Stock option repricing",

The implications of using RCT and image theory to model decision making are discussed with reference to three ethical systems. RCT is shown to be consistent with Utilitarian ethics, but not with Kantian or Virtue-based ethics. Image theory is shown to be consistent with each.

It subsequently confronts this typology with empirical data collected in an interview study of concrete stakeholder management practices, involving in-depth research interviews with forty-four managers working in the Dutch financial services industry. The findings of this theory-building study suggest that there are limits to the applicability of the contract model in the context of stakeholder management, and that disregarding either the model or its limitations may lead to highly ineffective firm-stakeholder relations.","Boundary conditions; Contractual failure; Contractual schemes; Interview study; Stakeholder theory",

In doing so, I argue that stakeholder theory and responsibilities to non-shareholder constituencies can be made more intelligible by reference to Kant's conception of perfect and imperfect duties. I draw upon Onora O'Neill's (1996) work, Towards Justice and Virtue: A Constructivist Account of Practical Reasoning. In her text O'Neill underlines a number of relevant issues including: the integration of particularist and universalist accounts of morality; the priority of obligations over rights; the importance of the distinction between imperfect and perfect duties; and the relation between the virtues and imperfect duties. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the paper argues that business ethicists should avoid recommending the institutionalising of stakeholder responsibilities in terms of legally defined sets of stakeholder rights. Instead, we should regard stakeholder responsibilities as uniformalised imperfect duties. Conceiving responsibilities to all stakeholder groups in this manner, allows the firm the freedom to perfect these duties in ways appropriate to cultural and societal setting, and in accordance with the capacity to do so.",,

The change in the firm's customer equity is the change in its current and future customers' lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers' performance with that of competitors' drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions.

Moral intensity regarding software piracy has been argued to be related to the extent of software piracy. An understanding of the development of moral intensity regarding software piracy in individuals would aid businesses in developing and implementing policies that may help them reduce software piracy. In this research we studied the similarities and differences in development of moral intensity regarding software piracy among university students in two different cultures, the U.S. and Thailand. In particular, we studied the influence of the immediate community of individuals, such as other students, faculty, and other university employees, on the development of moral intensity regarding software piracy of the two groups of students. Results indicate that, in general, there are significant differences in moral intensity regarding software piracy between students from the U.S. and Thailand, and that gender differences also exist. Though the effect of the immediate community on the self-perception of moral intensity regarding software piracy of students was significant, there appears to be very little significant differences in this effect between the students in the two different countries studied.

The events evolved into a bitter political process in which the more ethically aware members of faculty challenged efforts to cover-up. Here the focus is on the motives and behavior of faculty members involved in this case rather than the alleged plagiarist's. The role played by the main actors involved in the process in examined using the theory of moral development and the organizational politic perspective. The paper discusses the mechanisms available to raise ethical awareness and prevent academic misconduct, and the limitations of self-regulation and self-monitoring that prevails in the university system. It also examines the impact of ethics instruction and faculty ethical standards on students' behavior and concludes that ethics instruction can only be effective when the principles taught are in line with daily actions of their instructors.","Academic misconduct; Business education; Business faculty; Codes of ethical conduct; Moral development; Plagiarism; Politics; Self-regulation; Whistleblowing",

The results of this study indicate that while students are generally upset with cheating in their class, a large proportion of them nonetheless engage in such behavior. It was further found that students have a good understanding of what constitutes ethical behavior in the business world and the need for such behavior. However, they also believe that business people fail to act in an ethical manner, and that they may need to act unethically to advance their careers. Students' concern with business ethics contrasted sharply with their own lack of personal ethics. This ""paradox"" is consistent with the idea that students view the practicality of an action as being more important than its ethicality.

Advertising can increase the number of visitors to a Web site. Web site features that facilitate presale, sale, and postsale tasks by increasing visitor-to-customer conversion can augment bottom-line performance measured in terms of economic value added (EVA). The results demonstrate that advertising spending alone has only a negligible impact on firm performance. A more appropriate profit-enhancing strategy for B2C companies is to complement advertising spending with a superior shopping experience that augments the value customers gain from the purchase experience. Advertising spending may act as a stimulus to increase Web site traffic. If complemented with Web site features that support customers' purchase-requirements determination and product-ownership experience, it can enhance the performance of B2C firms. Copyright © 2003 M.E.

New research should not, however, only extend the limited number of studies that describe observable patterns in sexual health but should also seek to determine their underlying social causation. To achieve this, both methodological and ontological shifts are necessary in the existing research paradigm; we advocate that a broad range of qualitative techniques be deployed both to uncover the empirical details of specifically African sexual behaviours and to highlight and explore the 'relational' nature of sexual decision-making. Rather than fixing on individuals, analysis must situate them within the broader discursive and material frames that structure the boundaries of decision-making. In addition, researchers need to utilise the parallel literature on the social embeddedness of HIV in Africa to inform analysis of the British context. It would then be possible to address the crucial question of whether the social conditions known to cause high-risk behaviours and facilitate transmission in Africa persist, or are transformed, after migration to the UK. A key, and neglected, dimension of this is the role of spatial context in relational sexual decision-making and the constitution of social relationships in particular arenas. This needs further thought, particularly in relation to domestic space and gender identities. We believe that the research agenda proposed herein has much to contribute to interventions and service provision. Nevertheless, we are mindful of the need for self-reflexivity about our role in the production of powerful knowledges about sex. Our final proposal is that researchers seek ways to work with, not on, African communities in order to facilitate their own informed management of sexual health. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Various inquiries have highlighted the difficulties in finding or identifying particular individuals to blame for particular events, and in the context of situations as complex as these it can sometimes be helpful to investigate the comparative ethical distance of various participants in these events. In this essay I offer a characterization of ethical distance in terms of moral responsibility, and in doing so I describe and illustrate the rough inverse correlation between moral distance and degrees of moral responsibility. I urge that the concept of ethical distance is capable of shedding light upon situations in which several people are involved in bringing about a state of affairs. I then argue that moral responsibility cannot do justice to all situations involving ethical distance. When the distance between a person and a state of affairs grows sufficiently large, a different type of treatment is called for, and I introduce the notion of moral taint to describe the moral status of agents in these situations.",,

This procedure is encouraged under strict joint and several liability, which permits plaintiffs to recover greater damages from defendants - usually businesses -with less moral culpability for the tort than poorer defendants, who bear greater culpability. In a case involving the Disney Corporation and a negligent amusement park rider, for instance, Disney was forced to pay 86% of the court award to the plaintiff, even though the jury found the company to be only 1% liable for the injury. The legal principle of joint and several liability violates morality in several different ways. Even though the principle appears to be better in the short run for plaintiffs, I will show that it fails not only to satisfy utilitarianism, but compensatory justice as well. Hence, the legal principle of joint and several liability should be eliminated in favor of a better, fairer law, which I will briefly sketch at the end.","Business ethics; Compensatory justice; Joint and several liability; Tort law; Utilitarianism",

We presented hypothetical selling situations to respondents with manipulated variables consisting of solicitation status (unsolicited versus solicited) and use of money (for faculty or for student activities). Both main effects and the interaction effect were significant such that respondents perceived it to be more ethical to sell an examination book when the book was unsolicited and when the money was being used to fund student activities. The variable most correlated with faculty members' beliefs that book selling is ethical and the faculty members' self-reports of whether or not they have engaged in bookselling was how widespread the practice appeared to be on campus. About 30 percent of faculty members sold textbooks over the past year at a dollar value of about $80 per professor. About 38 percent of respondents reported they believed the practice to be generally ethical.

The persistence, even efflorescence, of indigenous gift exchange, in tandem with greater participation in the market economy, challenges conventional notions about the structures and meanings of development. The introduced market economy can be inflected to serve indigenous sociocultural and economic goals by place-based processes that transform market relations and practices into nonmarket social relationships. These kinds of inflections of the market economy are common and widespread and therefore worthy of consideration for their theoretical insights into processes of social and economic change and the meanings of development.

The perspective is essential for their license to operate and forms the basis for business principles and practices. The lack of internationally accepted reporting standards on what, when and where to report makes it difficult to assess sustainability, however. Moreover, measuring tools providing information on SCP are only the first step towards sustainability. To prevent negative effects of operations being transferred from one company to another, the second step is the development of a system-based approach for all companies that contribute to an end product. This paper presents the findings of a study about the use of environmental indicators for food production and proposes a measuring method for environmental sustainability in food production systems. The study shows that environmental SCP often focuses on events at a local level. The enormous number of indicators found in the literature generates too much data that often provide no additional knowledge on the environmental sustainability of a system. Moreover, although environmental research has addressed many aspects of sustainability, it has often ignored interactions. Overall environmental implications of food production are therefore poorly understood. The proposed measuring method uses three indicators that address global environmental issues: the use of energy (from both fossil and renewable sources), land and water. The systemic approach can calculate trade-offs along supply chains that make up a production system. The use of the method implies an extension of environmental SCP towards the overall performance of a production system. The final outcome is expressed in three performance indicators: the total land, energy and water requirement per kilogram of available food. For companies, the data generated can be used to compare trends over time, to compare results with targets and to benchmark a company against others. For consumers, data can be used to compare the environmental effects of various foods. The method is also applicable to other business sectors. The study is part of a multidisciplinary project on the scientific modeling and measuring of SCP involving economic, social and environmental dimensions. Acceptance of the measuring methods developed may be a powerful contribution towards creating sustainable business practices. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, it also identifies the dominant ethics management strategies that characterise each of the stages. It is done in a way that avoids claiming that the more advanced modes of managing ethics necessarily represent moral development by business organisations. Instead of claiming the organisations develop morally, we claim that organisations move through an evolutionary process of improving their sophistication in managing ethical performance.","Business ethics; Compliance; Institusionalisation; Integrity; Management; Moral development; Strategy",

Despite this assertion, modern economic theory has become tightly focused on the pursuit of economic self-interests at the expense of other, higher order motives. This paper will argue that the tendency to employ such an egocentric strategy often generates externalities and inequalities that serve to detract from the greater welfare of society. However, by tempering these economic self-interests with non-economically motivated considerations, this paper will suggest that individuals may create tremendous benefits to society, precisely as Smith outlined more than two centuries ago. In defense of this assertion, this paper will review an array of theoretical arguments and empirical findings that suggest that today's entrepreneurs are not only seeking to satisfy both selfish and ethical motivations, but in so doing they are also contributing substantially to the overall welfare of society through job creation, wealth redistribution, and a lack of discrimination. As such, it appears that spirit and impact of the capitalist system that Smith envisioned is being realized through entrepreneurship.","Adam Smith; Business ethics; Capitalism; Economic theory; Entrepreneurship; Utilitarianism",

We find sector to play an important part in relation to business practices and social capital. Our inclusion of SMEs from Germany and the United Kingdom has called attention to cultural, institutional and economic aspects of two regions of Europe and how they can influence SME social capital. Social capital is found to be influenced by context and, in particular, institutional arrangements. In analysing the data we note particular areas of interest from the point of view of SMEs and social capital as being: formal engagement, networking within sectors, networking across sectors, volunteerism and giving to charity, and finally a focus on why people engage. We conclude that there is a considerable amount of further research needed on social capital, SME's and business ethics.","Charitable giving; Civic engagement; Corporate social responsibility; Germany; Local community; Networks; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Social capital; United Kingdom; Volunteerism",

However though valued, entrepreneurs and small businesses are under increasing pressure to be mindful of the social and moral implications of their activities. These developments have given the question of business ethics a central place in organisational research. Much of this attention has been directed at the large organisation, despite the fact that the majority of businesses are small firms. A significant amount of the research in the area of business ethics is prescriptive in orientation with an underlying assumption that enterprise and ethics are mutually exclusive, with a key aim being to bring them together. In looking at the question of ethics and enterprise (understood here as small business activity) this paper will argue that a prescriptive approach should be avoided and an alternative will be outlined. With reference to the concept of Lebensfuhrung, translated in Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism as the ""manner of leading one's life"", this paper will argue that rather than conceiving of enterprise as an activity which needs an infusion of ethics, enterprise is by its very nature ethical. It is ethical in the sense of advocating a particular way by which one should live one's life or in the case of small business owners, presenting an account of how a small business should be owned, nurtured and developed.","Enterprise ethic; Entrepreneurship; Lebensfuhrung ""the manner of leading one's life""; Max Weber; Small business",

The study uses primary data collected from 345 business manager participants of Executive MBA programs in selected business schools in India, Korea and the United States using Hofstede's Value Survey Module (94) and an instrument designed by the researchers to measure respondents' ethical attitudes (attitudes toward business ethics in general and toward twelve common questionable practices in particular). Results indicate that national culture has a strong influence on business managers' ethical attitudes. In addition to national culture, respondents' general attitudes toward business ethics are related to their personal integrity; their attitudes toward questionable business practices are related to the external environment and gender, as well as to their personal integrity. A strong relationship exists between cultural dimensions of individualism and power distance and respondents' ethical attitudes toward certain questionable practices. The analysis of the relationship between cultural dimensions of masculinity, uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation and respondents' ethical attitudes toward questionable practices produced mixed results, likely due to the lack of notable differences in cultural dimension scores among the countries surveyed.",,

Two hundred and twenty-one Thai male workers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that included demographic variables and occupational exposures to organophosphate pesticides (as control variables), migration stressors, intervening variables (traditional health beliefs, social support, drinking behavior, and utilization of medical services), and a psychological distress scale. In multivariate analysis, migration stressors, the migrants' traditional health beliefs, quality of current social relationships, drinking behavior, as well as age and occupational exposure were significantly associated with psychological distress. Workers who reported higher migration stressors (perceived the migration to be difficult, and often felt homesick), those with higher levels of traditional health beliefs, those whose social relationships with other Thai co-workers were poor, those who consumed either no alcohol or large amounts of alcohol, and those who reported ""problem drinking"" had significantly higher levels of psychological distress. A moderating effect of the quality of social relationships with co-workers on the association between homesickness and psychological distress was found. Additionally, migrants aged 28-34 and those who were experiencing eye irritation from chemicals at work had significantly increased levels of distress.

Other repeated themes included requests for visa assistance, employee theft, nepotism and non-adherence to contractual obligations. This study has important implications for helping Australian managers improve the way they approach potential ethical situations in China. Four key coping strategies can be identified from the data: managers spoke of not compromising their own morals, of attempting to understand the motivation of Chinese colleagues, of talking to others and of adhering to company policy. These strategies suggest practical steps may be taken by organisations when training managers for business activities in China. In particular, structuring of mentoring relationships between experienced and less experienced practitioners may be of assistance. Cultural training for managers and clear company policy on contentious issues such as bribery may also be of benefit.

Those that do take such an approach commit talent and know-how, not just dollars, to a pressing but carefully chosen social need and then tell the world about the cause and their service to it. Through the association, both the business and the cause benefit in ways they could not otherwise. Organizations such as Avon, ConAgra Foods, and Chevrolet have recognized that a sustained cause-branding program can improve their reputations, boost their employees' morale, strengthen relations with business partners, and drive sales. And the targeted causes receive far more money than they could have from direct corporate gifts alone. The authors examine these best practices and offer four principles for building successful cause-branding programs. First, they say, a company should select a cause that advances its corporate goals. That is, unless the competitive logic for supporting the cause is clear, a company shouldn't even consider putting its finite resources behind it. Second, a business should commit to a cause before picking its charitable partners. Otherwise, a cause-branding program may become too dependent on its partners. Third, a company should put all its assets to work, especially its employees. It should leverage the professional skills of its workers as well as its other assets such as distribution networks. And fourth, a company should promote its philanthropic initiatives through every possible channel. In addition to using the media, it should communicate its efforts through the Web, annual reports, direct mail, and so on. Cause branding is a way to turn the obligations of corporate citizenship into a valuable asset.

Yet memory is a complex process that involves the repression of some experiences in order to protect the moral integrity of the personality. Without the capacity to repress what one's moral conscience would not accept, the mind can be overtaken by neurotic ambivalence and moral confusion. In the context of business competition, where the pressures for potential gains and losses can be immense, long repressed desires can receive renewed strength resulting in a weakening of moral constraint. In this essay, I use the psycho-analytic theory of repression to investigate the complex, psychological vicissitudes of human memory. The theory of repression is a particularly powerful tool to investigate the moral implications of memory because memories which are repressed - i.e., forbidden consciousness - are done so at the behest of the individual's moral ideals. Experiences that offend these ideals or threaten the integrity of the ego can be repressed. Repression, then, is an infallible index of moral judgement. I will apply the theory of repression to the characters in and story line of Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman to elucidate the relationship between memory and ethics in business. Death of a Salesman is well suited for this purpose because the memories of the main characters are central to the play and are inextricably linked to the moral challenge competition in business poses.","Business ethics; Competition; Culture; Memory; Repression",

Inasmuch as these events have brought ethical questions about business to the forefront in the media and public consciousness as never before, they are of signal importance for the field of business ethics. I offer some observations and conjectures about the bearing of the recent scandals on the literature on business ethics. I defend the following contentions: 1. Recent events reveal serious weaknesses of the stakeholder theory about the social responsibilities of business which lacks prohibitions against fraud and deception. This is a glaring deficiency of standard versions of the stakeholder theory, but it is easily remedied by adding explicit prohibitions against fraud and deception. In addition, recent events highlight the stakeholder theory's very naive and unrealistic hopes and expectations for business executives as moral arbiters and agents of social improvement. 2. Recent events do not constitute an objection to the shareholder theory about the social responsibilities of business, however, these events make evident the implausibility of strong versions of the invisible hand theory. 3. Schemes of payment and reward often create perverse incentives for individuals to engage in unethical conduct. 4. Both the shareholder theory and the stakeholder theory need to add a constraint that requires executives to respect the professional obligations of employees.",,

Our examination of this relationship focuses on education, an established indicator of SES, and tests whether social relations, particularly with children, mediate and/or moderate the education-health link for middle-aged and older parents. The data are drawn from a regionally representative sample of adults (aged 40-93) in the Detroit area, USA. All analyses are stratified by gender (N=males: 330; females: 468). A series of multiple regression analyses were performed to test whether social relations mediate the association between education and health. Although analyses revealed no mediation effect, both men and women with less education were found to have smaller social networks. Women with more education confided less in their children than women with less education did. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were performed to test whether social relations variables moderate the relationship between education and health. Separate analyses by gender indicated that men, but not women, with less education who had larger networks and who perceived emotional, financial and sick care support to be available from a child had lower scores on a health problems index. Findings indicate that the health of lower-educated men in the presence of key social supports parallels the advantaged health status of men with higher levels of education. These findings suggest that social relationships may be a protective factor for the health of men in the lower socioeconomic strata. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Nonetheless, moral reasoning seems of marginal relevance at best in the context of business ethics. Simply put, moral reasoning measurement indices are often only weakly related to many other apparently pertinent variables, and such findings cast doubt upon the construct validity of cognitive moral development. Many such unexpectedly weak relationships, however, may stem from two largely unrecognized methodological artifacts. The first artifact is an almost total reliance on the P index of the Defining Issues Test (DIT) designed to assess moral development even when this index may be inappropriate in a particular context. A second artifact that seems particularly salient in the context of attitudes toward authority involves a not always appropriate reliance on samples that include respondents whose moral reasoning is uncoupled from their action choices. These artifacts may restrict the amount of variance explained in observed relationships, and thus constrain the potential for moral reasoning to understand and explain behavior and attitudes relevant in the context of business ethics. Researchers are urged to use DIT D scores (in addition to P scores) in specific situations, and to examine relationships among high DIT U scorers whose moral reasoning is tightly coupled with their action choices. The application of these guidelines may have profound implications for advancing our fundamental understanding of moral reasoning, and of increasing its relevance to business ethics.","Authority relationships; Ethical orientations; Moral reasoning",

Marketing communications on the internet have experienced explosive growth in the last few years; so much so that Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sought to include electronic marketing as a medium that will be monitored under its jurisdiction. In the interest of consumers, the FTC has developed two doctrines, deception and unfairness, oriented to protect consumers from unscrupulous marketing activities.

Being trustworthy yourself, however, does not guarantee that you are capable of building trust in an organization. That takes old-fashioned managerial virtues like consistency, clear communication, and a willingness to tackle awkward questions. It also requires a good defense: You must protect trust from its enemies. Any act of bad management erodes trust, so the list of potential enemies is endless. Among the most common enemies of trust, though, are inconsistent messages from top management, inconsistent standards, a willingness to tolerate incompetence or bad behavior, dishonest feedback, a failure to trust others to do good work, a tendency to ignore painful or politically charged situations, consistent corporate underperformance, and rumors. Fending off these enemies must be at the top of every chief executive's agenda. But even with constant vigilance, an organization and its leaders will sometimes lose people's trust. During a crisis, managers should enlist the help of an objective third party--chances are you won't be thinking clearly--and be available physically and emotionally. If you ""go dark"" in the face of a crisis, employees will worry about the company's survival, about their own capacity to cope, and about your abilities as a leader. And if trust has broken down so badly that your only choice is to start over, you can do so by figuring out exactly how the breach of trust happened, ascertaining the depth and breadth of the loss, owning up to the loss instead of downplaying it, and identifying as precisely as possible the specific changes you must make to rebuild trust.",,"article; business ethics; commercial phenomena; ethics; human; leadership; organization; public relations; standard; trust; United States; Commerce; Ethics, Business; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Leadership; Organizational Culture; Organizational Innovation; Trust; United States"

The result has been the elimination of boundaries, more flexible organizations, and a greater interaction among individuals and organizations. On the negative side, the specialization of firms on single areas of competence has resulted in the disaggregation of the value chain and in the disaggregation of ethical and legal responsibility. To illustrate this point, the paper considers some cases, such as the case of the ""beer girls"" of Southeast Asia, who are used unethically by distributors to sell beer and liquor. To deal with the problem of the disaggregation of ethical responsibility, managers can use organizational culture and ethical values to control the performance of employees and of other organizations. Contemporary developments in business ethics also offer tools for dealing with the problem. For example, ""global corporate citizenship,"" integrated social contracting theory, and stakeholder learning dialogues provide ways of integrating the interests of all stakeholders. The task is now to use these new approaches to create a governance process that incorporates the voices of all stakeholders, especially the voices of those stakeholders that have legitimate and urgent moral claims, but lack the power to establish those claims.","Network organizations; Social contracting; Stakeholder dialogue; Strategic alliances; Strategic management",

The third measure was an index based on interview perceptions of corruption (Corruption Perceptions Index or CPI) in that nation. Validity of the three measures was further established by finding a highly significant correlation with real gross domestic product per capita (RGDP/Cap). The CPI had by far the strongest correlation with RGDP/Cap, explaining over three fourths of the variance. Corruption is increasingly argued to be a barrier to development and economic growth.

The paper asserts that it was Drucker's experiences of Weimar society and of the Weimar economy that led Drucker to seek a new socio-economic reality. This latter reality Drucker sought through management. The paper thus describes how the past led Drucker to seek management as, following Drucker, ""a means to a bigger end""; and yet, simultaneously, not as an end in itself.","Drucker; Ethics; Experience; Germany; Management; Morality; Weimar",

The impact of social marketing on innovation and entrepreneurship is discussed using the case of multinational pharmaceutical firms that are under pressure when marketing HIV treatments in poor countries. The argument this paper supports is that social welfare may eventually be diminished if forced social responsibility is imposed. The case of providing subsidized AIDS medication to less developed nations is used to illustrate how social blackmail may result in less innovation, entrepreneurship, and product development efforts by the pharmaceutical industry, ultimately reducing social welfare.","Corporate entrepreneurship and social responsibility; Innovation and ethics; Innovation and public policy","drug; article; business ethics; commercial phenomena; developing country; drug industry; economics; ethics; financial management; Health Care and Public Health; human; international cooperation; legal liability; patent; policy; politics; social behavior; social change; Health Care and Public Health; Developing Countries; Drug Industry; Entrepreneurship; Ethics, Business; Humans; Internationality; Liability, Legal; Marketing of Health Services; Patents; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Politics; Public Policy; Social Change; Social Responsibility"

Few researchers have studied this relationship, however, and those studies that have been conducted have produced mixed results. While some researchers have found that greater tenure is associated with higher levels of ethical reasoning, others have found the reverse to be true. The findings of this particular study of 270 current U.S. corporate managers, who responded to a nationwide survey, indicated that there is indeed a link between tenure and principled reasoning. More tenured managers demonstrated lower principled reasoning than their less tenured counterparts. As the number of years of tenure increased, principled reasoning scores declined. The results of this study, as well as a comparison to the results of previous studies that have been conducted, are discussed within this paper.","Ethics and managers; Managers, tenure, and principled reasoning; Principled reasoning and managers",

The difficulty that executives face in such cases is that scientific knowledge develops over time and does not necessarily proceed in a straight line toward true conclusions. At the beginning of a new field of research, there is much uncertainty and disagreement among the experts. The solution of the ozone problem required a remarkable cooperation among science, business, and international governments. After looking at the role of DuPont executives in this drama, and the difficulties facing any executive dealing with uncertain science, the paper turns to an evaluation of the field of Business Ethics to see what light it might throw on this and analogous problems. Finally, the paper offers specific suggestions in terms of principles in dealing with uncertain science, and concludes that the course of action that DuPont followed, including some mistakes, can serve as a model for analogous crises.","CFC's; DuPont; Environmental ethics; International cooperation; Montreal protocol; Ozone depletion; Uncertain science",

The fall-out revealed that some of our most respected business figures had not been as ethical, or even as lawful, as we would have hoped. This impropriety produced in Australia an awakening to business ethics. Whilst many companies endeavoured to introduce ethical practices into their corporations, they perceived ethics as a way of minimising damage to the corporation and in some cases as a means of competitive advantage. What was lost was the reason that one should embark on business ethics; and that is to make the society and corporate Australia a more ethical place in which to exist. This paper proposes a model based on 2 factors: commitment and partnerships, as a means of enabling corporate Australia to refocus attention on the main purpose of being inherently ethical in all that we do. This ethical model requires a commitment to partnerships with all stakeholders both internal and external in an attempt to enhance the level of ethical business practices that are contemplated and pursued within corporate Australia. Whilst the research agenda and the information collected is Australian based, it is hoped that the ideas contained within this paper will have a wider appeal to corporations in similar cultural settings.","Australia; Commitment; Ethics; Model; Partnership",

The thesis is that the advent of the market introduced incentives for individual-centred and household-centred economic strategising that were not fully compatible with the economic functions of the village's social institutions, several of which had only re-established their importance after the collapse of communism. It is shown that the power of the household head, while greater than under communism, is weakening as modernising western values and market influences spread. Similarly the key role of the clan in social and economic life is declining. Whereas traditionally, successful clan members would have provided other members with jobs, some members were now substituting financial aid for jobs, and hiring non-clan members they argued would work harder. It is shown that villagers have clear, consistent and accurate views on the change in successful wealth accumulation strategies consequent on transition. Interestingly, wealth is not an important determinant of status. In the post-communist era personal qualities such as intelligence, honesty, loyalty and generosity have come to the fore as key determinants of status. Also a rise in the importance of family reputation clearly reflects the move away from wider social criteria including political connection in status determination. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

With the history of the region replete with examples of ethnic mobilisation and its devastating consequences present even today in the former Yugoslavia and Chechnya, a thorough examination of the propositions suggested above seems warranted. The usual measures of social capital seem problematic in plural societies, especially ones undergoing rapid political transitions. The release of data from the 1995-98 World Values Survey, which includes a large number of countries from the post-communist space, provides an opportunity to explore the nature and consequences of social capital in this region. The countries vary enough in the quality and completeness of their democratic transitions to allow us to make some preliminary observations. First, do the usual markers of social capital (interpersonal trust, political interest and voluntary group participation) correlate with the most and least successful cases of democratisation in East-Central Europe and the post-Soviet states? Are the countries with the highest overall levels of apparent social capital the most democratic? Are they the countries in which individuals report the highest levels of satisfaction with democratic institutions (one of Putnam's measures of institutional performance)? Are they the same countries as those in which respondents are most confident in democracy? Second, are the effects the same when one takes into account the ethnic diversity of the country? Does social capital function in the same manner in plural countries, or are the usual markers instead more likely to indicate dangerous polarisation in that society instead of social engagement that keeps democracy healthy and strong?

If they invite government oversight, they may be hampered by costly regulations. And if they adopt wage scales and working conditions that prevail in the wealthiest democracies, they may drive jobs to countries with less stringent standards. Such dilemmas call for clear, hard thinking. To aid in that undertaking, Roger Martin introduces the virtue matrix--a tool to help executives analyze corporate responsibility by viewing it as a product or service. The author uses real-life examples to explore the forms and degrees of corporate virtue. He cites Aaron Feuerstein, CEO of Malden Mills, a textile company whose plant was destroyed by fire in 1995. Rather than move operations to a lower-wage region, Feuerstein continued to pay his idled workforce and rebuilt the plant. Unlike the typical CEO of a publicly held corporation, who is accountable to hundreds or thousands of shareholders, Feuerstein was free to act so generously because he had only a few family members to answer to. But as Martin points out, corporations don't operate in a universe composed solely of shareholders. They can be subject to pressure from citizens, employees, and political authorities. The virtue matrix provides a way to assess these forces and how they interact. Martin uses it to examine why the public clamor for more responsible corporate conduct never seems to abate. Another issue the author confronts is anxiety over globalization. Finally, Martin applies the virtue matrix to two crucial questions: What are the barriers to increasing the supply of corporate virtue? And what can companies do to remove those barriers?",,"article; commercial phenomena; human; institutional ethics; organization; organization and management; public relations; social behavior; United States; Commerce; Community-Institutional Relations; Ethics, Institutional; Humans; Organizational Culture; Organizational Objectives; Social Responsibility; United States"

I evaluate arguments for both approaches and find them wanting. I then shift the focus from ethics to law and ask: ""Why should corporations obey the law?"" Contrary to what shareholder theories typically imply, neoclassical or profit maximization theories of the firm can offer answers based only on instrumental justifications. Instrumental justifications for obeying the law, however, are pragmatically and normatively incoherent. This is because the modern corporation is a legal artifact. It exists because communities create the legal framework necessary for its existence. Individual corporations can therefore be said to owe their existence to a partnership (what might be called a social contract) between shareholders and governments, a partnership that is itself built on the shared though often implicit understanding that corporations have an unconditional (categorical) obligation both to obey the law and to treat their stakeholders ethically while generating wealth for their shareholders.",,

In the accession process framework are specified another priorities (e. g., harmonization of legal system), measures for implementation and conditions for providing support. However, adaptation depends also on transparency of decision-making, law enforcement and elimination of corruption. Reform of public administration, made through decentralization, is based on operation of state administration and regional self-government and on changing competencies with the aim to reduce expenditures and improve services. Respected in this process are principles of subsidiarity and competitive environment. In general, there has been a strengthening of the system of governmental management bodies like, e. g., Custom directorate of the Slovak republic. In the case of public finance the gradual reductions of subsidies is the basic principle to be followed in the next future and market functioning should be improved via financial control over enterprises. Economic policy priorities have shifted from liberalization and privatization towards structural changes in corporate sector, reforms of public finance and regional development. The importance of EU regulation has been increasing. However, in certain areas as, e. g., in ecology, introduction of such measures can lead to higher costs for domestic producers and to more intense competition from abroad. Institutional building includes also effort to increase transparency and business ethics. Important is an amendment of Commercial Code, which has transposed several EU directives regulating corporate law. The amendment should increase transparency of ownership and business relations and, therefore, lead to a better corporate governance.

Furthermore, these formal networks are not underpinned by embedded social relationships and informal information exchanges.

The results, while broadly conclusive of a positive relationship, are not entirely consistent. In addition, most of the previous studies have concentrated on large-scale cross-industry studies and often with a single variable for corporate social performance, in order to produce statistically significant results. This weakens the richness of understanding that might be obtained from a single industry study with multiple social variables, which would also allow investigation of inter-relationships between individual and sub-sets of social performance measures and between individual and sub-sets of social performance and financial performance measures. There have also been criticisms that the results lack a rigorous theoretical basis, and the paper demonstrates clearly how stakeholder theory must form the basis for this area of research. Following a review of the literature this paper presents the initial findings from a study of the U.K. Supermarket industry which suggest that contemporaneous social and financial performance are negatively related, while prior-period financial performance is positively related with subsequent social performance. Positive relationships between both age and size of the company with social performance are also found.","Business-ethics; Corporate-financial-performance; Corporate-social-performance; Corporate-social-responsib ihty; U.K.-supermarkets",

An interactive tripartite approach is superior for meeting the complex requirements of an applied ethic. To illustrate how deficiencies of a ""strong"" virtue ethics formulation can be overcome by a balanced tripartite approach, this paper compares normative leadership paradigms (each based on a combination of virtue, deontology, or consequentialist perspectives) and the dangers inherent in each. The preferred paradigm is servant leadership, grounded in a tripartite ethic. Effective application of such an ethics approach in contemporary organizations requires further empirical research to develop a greater understanding of the moral language actually used.

The regulatory framework that facilitated privatisation of the utility companies has foundations based upon free market principles involving a transfer from regulation to competitive markets wherever possible. Where competition is not feasible, continuing economic regulation is relied upon, designed to mirror the competitive market to induce, through comparative competition and the price capping mechanism, incentives for greater efficiency. The New Labour Government, having fundamentally reviewed this framework when it came to office, has surprisingly endorsed its basic tenets. However, it wishes to superimpose social responsibility regulations designed to achieve social policy rather than economic objectives. This interventionist approach is in itself in conflict with the free market inspired regulatory framework but additionally, the imposition of social policy objectives creates fundamental ambiguities within the framework for the key stakeholders. The paper concludes that the Government's policy, by eliciting stakeholder confusion and perverse behaviour, could be counter-productive but that ethical theories and frameworks can contribute to thinking in this vital area of the economy.","Business ethics; Economic regulation; Privatisation; Social responsibility; Stakeholders; Utilities",

Extant business ethics literature available for application to international business demonstrates some variety but no comprehensive principles. While the domains of both international business and business ethics are expanding, they are also becoming increasingly divergent. At the same time, the primacy accorded to the multinational enterprise in both fields ignores the socio-cultural and political embeddedness of economic activities, and multiple agencies in international business (individuals, firms, nations, etc.). Some international business theorists have offered the view that international exchange should be the central building block for theories on inter national business. In this paper, it is argued that international exchange could be the fundamental unit of analysis for international business ethics as well. The potentially unifying features of exchange norms and ethical principles leads the author to develop some core exchange ethics principles that are tested on three recent international business practices.

A specific example is then discussed, describing the source material, the method, the development of the research questions, and the way in which reliability and validity were established.

This charge is primarily related to the technical, mathematical nature of accounting and its ability to dehumanise individuals. Broadbent (1998, see also DeMoss and McCann, 1997) has also contended that ""accounting logic"" excludes emotion. She suggests that a more emancipatory form of accounting could be possible if emotion were given a voice and allowed to be heard within accounting discourse (see also Kjonstad and Wilmott, 1995). This paper contends that emotion should be introduced into accounting education and in particular emotional commitment to other individuals should be encouraged. It is suggested that one way to do this may be through business ethics education. It is also suggested that increasing ethical commitment to other individuals may go some way towards combating the tendency for accountancy to dehumanise other people. While there have been specific studies of ethics and accounting education there has, as yet, been little open debate about what the objectives of accounting ethics education should be or the specific techniques that could be used to meet the desired aims. This paper contends that accountancy has become dangerously dehumanised and that one of the most important objectives for any business ethics education must be to develop an empathy with ""the other"". The paper studies the developments within the medical, legal and engineering profession in order to suggest some specific methods which could be employed in order to rehumanise accountancy and develop a sense of moral commitment towards other individuals.","Accounting; Education; Emotion; Humanisation; The other",

This result emerges because gift giving is inefficient relative to cash, and not because of any arbitrary assumptions regarding communication.

The sample population consisted of consumers living in two rural Iowa communities with populations less than 10,000, agricultural-based economies, and retail mixtures of locally owned and operated small-sized businesses as well as national chain and discount organizations.

This paper investigates whether the principles of autonomy and beneficence provide a framework that is equally useful for framing issues in business ethics. It is argued that they do. First, the principle of autonomy, with its associated notions of informed consent, privacy, confidentiality, voluntariness, self-mastery, and so on, provides a consistent approach to the analysis of diverse issues that arise in business ethics from market research to recruitment practices. Second, it is argued that the relationships between a business and its stakeholders ground duties of beneficence.

The question of whether shareholders have obligations to stakeholders, however, has not been addressed sufficiently. I provide some needed attention to this matter by examining the positions of shareholders in the contemporary world of investing. Their positions are considerably different than that often envisioned by business ethicists and economists where shareholders determine the directions of corporate activities through their voting decisions. Typical contemporary investors rarely control corporate activities. If they own corporate securities directly, generally they own too small an interest to exercise control. And, in most cases, they do not even own corporate securities directly, but, rather, own shares in funds. Because of the positions of shareholders today, it is highly questionable whether most have obligations to stakeholders. This has a significant implication for business managers. Whether or not shareholders have obligations to stakeholders, business managers have a greater obligation to educate shareholders about how corporate activities affect stakeholders.

But should strategies for environmental sustainability be implemented for their own sake? What are the effects on corporate financial performance of going down this road-or of ignoring it? How can managers be guided through the trade-offs that ultimately must be made and assess how social performance impacts on overall long-term corporate profitability? This article presents a framework that describes the drivers of corporate social performance, the actions that managers can take to affect that performance, and the consequences of those actions on both corporate social and financial performance. Illustrated with references to strategies currently employed by corporations, the authors examine the effects of sustainability strategies on various corporation stakeholders from investors to employees, consumers and the community at large. Showing how companies are increasingly interested in gaining lasting strategic advantage through examining and improving relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, the authors argue that, as external costs become increasingly assignable, forward-looking corporate leadership requires reporting and assessment of both current and potential social and environmental impacts. The framework they present allows for the more careful understanding of both the drivers of social performance and the impacts of that performance on the various corporate stakeholders, permitting better integration of that information into the day-to-day operational decisions and the institutionalization of social concerns throughout the organization.",,"Consumer products; Industry; Managers; Societies and institutions; Key performance drivers; Planning; corporate strategy; environmental management; strategic approach; sustainability"

Concurrently, the immunosuppressive effects of psychosocial stress have been documented in Western populations, but have yet to be considered in cross-cultural contexts. This study uses lifestyle incongruity (inconsistency between a household's material style of life and its socioeconomic status) as a model of culture change and stress, and considers its impact on immune function in a sample of 230 10-20 year-olds from (Western) Samoa. Anthropometric, lifestyle, and psychosocial data were collected, as well as finger prick blood spot samples for analysis of C-reactive protein (marker of infection) and antibodies against the Epstein-Barr virus (marker of cell-mediated immune function). Controlling for potential confounders, adolescents from households with a material style of life that exceeds its socioeconomic status have reduced cell-mediated immune function, indicating an increased burden of psychosocial stress. Social relationships moderate this effect: lifestyle incongruity stress is pronounced among adolescents with a high degree of social integration, and absent in adolescents with low social integration. This finding is counter to the buffering role of social support reported in previous applications of lifestyle incongruity to adults, and suggests that the moderating role of social integration may be unique to adolescents. The potential utility of the lifestyle incongruity model for future cross-cultural studies of child and adolescent stress is discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Prior studies argue that firms increase demand for their debt and equity issues and, thus, lower their cost of capital, by providing more informative disclosures. However, empirical research has generally not been able to document significant benefits from increased disclosure. This paper proposes an alternative explanation - firms disclose because it is the socially responsible thing to do. We argue that companies have incentives to engage in stakeholder management by undertaking socially responsible activities and that providing extensive and informative disclosures is one such practice. We examine the relationship between firms' disclosures and measures of social responsibility. We use ratings provided by the Council on Economic Priorities as proxies for the degree of social responsibility adopted by the sample firms. Disclosure rankings provided by the annual Association for Investment Management and Research Corporate Information Committee Reports (AIMR Reports) are used to measure disclosure level. Our results indicate that there is a positive relationship between disclosure level and corporate social responsibility. That is, firms that engage in socially responsive activities provide more informative and/or extensive disclosures than do companies that are less focused on advancing social goals. In addition, we find that socially responsible firms are more likely to provide this increased disclosure through better investor relations practices. These results support our contention that increased disclosure is a form of socially responsible behavior.","Corporate social responsibility; Disclosure quality; Discretionary disclosures; Financial disclosures; Socially responsible; Stakeholder management",

But the heroic model of moral leadership usually doesn't work in the corporate world. Modesty and restraint are largely responsible for the achievements of the most effective moral leaders in business. The author, a specialist in business ethics, says the quiet leaders he has studied follow four basic rules in meeting ethical challenges and making decisions. The rules constitute an important resource for executives who want to encourage the development of such leaders among their middle managers. The first rule is ""Put things off till tomorrow."" The passage of time allows turbulent waters to calm and lets leaders' moral instincts emerge. ""Pick your battles"" means that quiet leaders don't waste political capital on fights they can't win; they save it for occasions when they really want to fight. ""Bend the rules, don't break them"" sounds easier than it is--bending the rules in order to resolve a complicated situation requires imagination, discipline, restraint, flexibility, and entrepreneurship. The fourth rule, ""Find a compromise,"" reflects the author's finding that quiet leaders try not to see situations as polarized tests of ethical principles. These individuals work hard to craft compromises that are ""good enough""--responsible and workable enough--to satisfy themselves, their companies, and their customers. The vast majority of difficult problems are solved through the consistent striving of people working far from the limelight. Their quiet approach to leadership doesn't inspire, thrill, or provide story lines for uplifting TV shows.

The findings provide some support for a tenet in stakeholder theory which asserts that the dominant stakeholder group, shareholders, financially benefit when management meets the demands of multiple stakeholders. Specifically, change in CSP was positively associated with growth in sales for the current and subsequent year. This indicates that there are short-term benefits from improving CSP. Return on sales was significantly positively related to change in CSP for the third financial period, indicating that long-term financial benefits may exist when CSP is improved.","Corporate social performance; Financial performance; Stakeholder theory; Transaction cost economics",

Adherence to such ethical practices can help to elevate the standards of behavior and thus of living, of traders and consumers alike. Against this background, this paper endeavors to identify the salient features of the Islamic framework of International Marketing Ethics. In particular, it highlights the capabilities and strengths of this framework in creating and sustaining a strong ethical international marketing culture. At the heart of Islamic marketing is the principle of value-maximization based on equity and justice (constituting just dealing and fair play) for the wider welfare of the society. Selected key international marketing issues are examined from an Islamic perspective which, it is argued, if adhered to, can help to create a value-loaded global ethical marketing framework for MNCs in general, and establish harmony and meaningful cooperation between international marketers and Muslim target markets in particular.","Corporate responsibility; Corruption; Ethical behavior; Ethics; International marketing; Islam; Marketing mix; Regulatory institutions; Value-maximization",

Confirmatory factor analyses conducted with independent samples indicated three factors - idealism, relativism, and veracity - account for the relationships among EPQ items. In order to provide further evidence of the instrument's nomological and convergent validity, correlations among the EPQ subscales, dogmatism, empathy, and individual differences in the use of moral rationales were examined.

We found that none of the six companies had a systematic stakeholder approach that extended to all potential green stakeholders. Rather, the importance of specific stakeholder groups seemed to be determined by managers' intuition and by the stance that the stakeholders themselves displayed towards the company. Green stakeholders with an institutional power base - government via legislation, environmental and industry regulators - emerged as the most immediately influential stakeholders. The Environment Agency, the environmental regulator, played an especially important role in the companies' environmental management.

This paper contributes to the literature concerned with MNCs' contribution to the sustainable development of LDCs. The concept of sustainable business practice (SBP) is proposed as relevant to understanding MNCs' contribution, and an analytical framework incorporating the content, context, and process of SBP is used to examine what SBP might consist of, as well as those conditions important for its widespread adoption. Results from a study examining the Colombian and Peruvian petroleum industries show that despite important contributions by MNCs to sustainable development, SBP is not yet widespread. The study also shows the importance of external institutional pressures-principally in the form of local legislation-for MNCs' contribution to the sustainable development of LDCs. Finally the paper shows how the process of change toward more SBP is closely linked to the external context in which MNCs operate, the characteristics of their internal context, and the internal and external processes linking these contexts. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Colombia and Peru; Environmental and social policy; Latin America; MNCs; Sustainable business practice","industrial practice; multinational enterprise; oil industry; petroleum; sustainable development; trade-environment relations; Colombia; Peru"

This article explicates how several important dimensions of culture can influence the effectiveness of common ethics initiatives, and recommends the development and application of a culture-structure contingency analysis in the task of encouraging ethical behavior in global businesses.","Corporate ethics programs; Cross-cultural ethics; Culture; Ethics; Global business ethics",

In this paper we argue that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (FSG) offer a unique opportunity for bridging the gap between the theory and practice of business ethics. We first explain what the FSG are and how they apply to organizations. We then show how discussions of the FSG might be used in business ethics courses in a way that is both theoretically sound and practically applicable. Finally, we show how the requirements of the FSG can be used by companies to develop effective ethical compliance programs. As such, we maintain that the FSG provide a powerful heuristic tool for the teaching and training of business ethics.",,

Development impacts may be more likely in sectors clearly linked to business interests, such as education and employment generation. Goals of organizational capacity building are more likely to be satisfied than those of citizen empowerment. CSOs and businesses reap mutual benefits from collaboration, but CSOs tend to shoulder more of the costs.

The proposed framework (1) offers new perspectives on myth: the consumer's, the producer's, the mythologist's, and the ethicist's; (2) explicates various distortion mechanisms of the myth; and (3) enables a redefinition of the relation of business myth to business ethics.

The answer to this question opens up the distinctive challenges, and opportunities, facing business ethics. Those challenges and opportunities emerge from the significant bearing organizational reality has upon individuals' conduct. As we consider how to assign responsibility for misconduct; how to provide guidance to organizational actors about what they ought to do; and how to develop responsive ethical theory, we need to take psychological and social forces into account. Organizations shape human behavior in ways that pose unavoidable questions about responsibility, practical guidance, and the enterprise of business ethics itself.

The costs of a proposed project are compared with the benefits, and if the benefits outweigh the costs, the project is accepted; if the costs exceed the benefits, the project is rejected. This model is applicable when tangible costs and benefits can be reasonably measured in monetary units. However, it is difficult to consider intangible factors in this model because intangible factors cannot be readily quantified in money. While some might argue that the financial model should not apply to healthcare decisions, the fact is that costs do enter into the picture. People may decide to forego needed healthcare because they cannot afford it. Healthcare providers may make choices based in part on the costs of diagnosis and treatment, rather than solely on medical information and what is best for the patient. Should financial issues enter into healthcare decisions - decisions about human health and well being? If so, how should the costs and benefits be measured and evaluated?

Following Levinas, it is argued that the ground of ethics lies in our corporeal sensibility to proximate others. Such moral sensibility, however, is readily blunted by a narcissistic preoccupation with self and securing the perception of self in the eyes of powerful others. Drawing upon a Lacanian account of the formation of the subject, and a Foucaultian account of the workings of disciplinary power, it is then argued that the governance of the corporation is effected precisely through encouraging such a narcissistic preoccupation with the self. For the most part our narcissistic concerns are bound to ethically indifferent financial interests. But in recent years they have also been harnessed to the demand for environmental, social and ethical responsibility by the corporation. It is argued, however, that the desire to be seen to be ethical - the ethics of narcissus - is the obverse of ""being responsible for."".",,

Classical American Pragmatism, understood as a school of philosophical thought, links these two approaches by providing a new grounding for moral theory in which moral rules are understood as working hypotheses abstracted from concrete situations and moral reasoning demands the return to concrete situations as the foundation for moral decision making that is inherently contextual. Thus moral decision making is bottom up rather than top down, and a sense of moral rightness comes not from the indoctrination of abstract principles but from attunement to the way in which moral beliefs and practices must be rooted naturally in the very conditions of human existence.",,

Bavelas et al. (1990) describe equivocation as non-straightforward communication. It appears ambiguous, contradictory, obscure or even evasive. In their view, equivocation is a form of information control for the purpose of maintaining social relationships. It is avoidance; a response chosen when all other communication choices in the situation would lead to negative consequences. A critical role of accountants and other organizational members is the communication of results and activities to management. Professional standards require that accountants be objective and unbiased reporters. If results are clearly reported to management, then costs associated with failed projects have the potential of being contained or minimized. The ethical communication choice for a failed project is a clear and fair representation. However, organizational members may choose to equivocate in order to maintain social relationships in the organizational environment. The two experiments in this research study address the question: ""If a negative project assessment exists, in fact, do subjects equivocate or send a clear message?"" The two experiments analyzed factors in the message choices of approximately two hundred and eighty student subjects. The results indicate that subjects apply different standards in message choices pertaining to a social relationship versus an organizational setting. Equivocal message selection in a purely social context, a gift which the receiver thinks is awful, ranged from eighty-four percent to eighty-nine percent, while equivocal message selection for a failed business project ranged from forty-five to sixty-two percent. The incidence of false reporting for the failed business project was inconsequential and ranged from one percent to two percent. Experimental results are encouraging with respect to false reporting. However, the pervasive nature of equivocal reporting is disturbing. It appears that the curriculum and organizational training should consider being more attentive to the ethical dimensions of equivocation. Additionally, organizations, that have a culture, which enables or fosters equivocation, should assess the impact of this on their operating activities.",,

Using qualitative data from interviews with senior bankers in the interest rate swaps (derivatives) industry in Australia, in this paper I demonstrate the importance of spatial relationships and processes of local embeddedness in the production of swaps. Local embeddedness is attributable to the rapid exchange of financial information in formal dealing networks that serve as central information sources, enabling dealers to formulate a ""market feel"" that influences their dealing strategies. Information interpretation and decision making in dealing processes and specialist financial labor provide the foundations for the product-based learning orientation of swaps dealing. Dealing networks are underpinned by social relationships, requiring face-to-face interaction that is facilitated by spatial proximity. Although the global swaps industry is dominated by multinational banks, the centrality of these embedded networks impedes globalization in interest rate swaps dealing. The global swaps industry comprises an international network of highly localized but interconnected operations based in world financial centers.","Financial sevices; Globalization; OTC derivatives; Production systems; Territorialization","banking; financial services; interest rate; Australia"

The second problem is related to the first and concerns the alleged relevance of a virtue perspective for business ethics. According to the virtue perspective discussed in this article, moral reasoning should take actual practice, and only actual practice, as a point of departure. In so doing ethics is claimed to become insulated from e.g. putting irrelevant demands on practitioners. Such demands are understood as based on abstract principles alien to the practice in question.

The present study examined the direct and indirect effects of individuals' perceptions of work climate on their ethical judgments and behavioral intentions regarding an ethical dilemma. A national sample of marketers was surveyed in a scenario-based research study. The results indicated that, although perceived climate dimensions did not have a direct effect on behavioral intentions, there were significant moderating effects. Climates perceived as emphasizing social responsibility and rules/codes moderated the individual ethical judgment-behavioral intentions relationship such that individuals were less likely to say that they would engage in a questionable selling practice even when they themselves did not believe the practice to be unethical. Respondents were somewhat more likely to form intentions consistent with their judgment that the questionable practice was morally acceptable when the ethical climate was characterized by an emphasis on team/friendship.","Business ethics; Ethical decision making; Ethical judgments; Ethical work climate",

The effect of this contract was to assign responsibility for generating wealth to business and responsibility for ensuring the equitable sharing of wealth to governments. Without question, this arrangement has resulted in substantial improvements in the quality of life in the industrialized world in the intervening period. I argue that with advance of economic globalization and the growing power and influence of multi national corporations, this division of responsibilities is not longer viable or defensible. What is needed, fifty years after the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, is a new social contract that shares responsibilities for human rights and related ethical responsibilities in a manner more in keeping with the vision captured by the post war Declaration.

Defining rational aspects of behaviour in economics will lead to the formal structures of organisational systems, which are independent of concrete but varying ""values"". Luhmann's ""Theory of systems of communication"" describes the internal dynamic forces of economic communication processes in terms of formal structures. On the other hand Habermas' ""Theory of discourse"" integrates the previous relationship between individual subjectivity and rational behaviour. Habermas gives an indication of how to separate subjective values and meaning from rational arguments in rational communication processes. The translation of these theoretical structures into practical applications for decision making processes and decision taking acts links the ethical, or value-oriented, context precisely to both individual and organisational areas of responsibility.","Business ethics; Communication; Discourse; Ethics; Habermas; Implicit contracts; Luhmann; Multicultural organisations; Organisation; Values",

Lurking behind their work is a concern with the problems of relativism. They hope to alleviate these problems by introducing three concepts important to the ISCT: ""authentic norms,"" which clarify culturally specific norms, ""priority rules,"" which determine the rules of engagement when authentic norms clash, and ""hypernorms,"" which measure the value of authentic norms against a thin set of universally upheld values.

This paper argues for the relevance of Aristotle's ideas on ethics and politics, and especially the link between them, for stakeholder theory. An Aristotelian approach suggests that the corporation should be considered as existing to allow the decision maker, who normally is a manager, to live a complete and good life and to make decisions that involve the interests of different stakeholders.

Furthermore, the models are mostly descriptive in nature and are based on the experiences of western countries. There has been little attempt to develop a model that accounts for corporate social responsibility in diverse environments with differing socio-cultural and market settings. In this paper an attempt has been made to fill this gap by developing a two-dimensional model of corporate social responsibility and empirically testing its validity in the context of two dissimilar cultures - Australia and Bangladesh. The two dimensions are the span of corporate responsibility (narrow to wider perspective) and the range of outcomes of social commitments of businesses (cost to benefit driven perspective). The test results confirm the validity of the two-dimensional model in the two environments. The Factor analysis revealed two leading dimensions. Cluster analysis pointed to two distinctive clusters of managers in both Australia and Bangladesh, one consisting of managers with a broad contemporary concept of social responsibility, and the other with a limited narrow view. The paper concludes that corporate social responsibility is two-dimensional and universal in nature and that differing cultural and market settings in which managers operate may have little impact on the ethical perceptions of corporate managers.","Business and society; Business ethics; Consumerism; Corporate environmentalism; Corporate social accounting; Corporate social responsibility; Societal marketing; Stakeholder model",

On the other hand, we argue, if one assumes multiple motives, economic and ethical, in ordinary business decisions, a more fruitful model of ethical motivation in such decisions emerges. In this paper multiple motives are assumed to be the norm in a world of large organizations, complex decisions and stakeholder management. An example of a technology acquisition decision, with environmental overtones is presented in illustration of this approach. A method for discerning motives, primarily in terms of behavioural efficacy is presented. On this basis a two step approach to morally evaluating mixed motives in business decisions is proposed. First, the fit of motives with substantive ethical values should be ascertained, and then the efficacy of moral motives in yielding ethical behaviour and outcomes should be determined. This approach, we conclude, offers a much more concrete model of the actual role of moral motives in business decision making. It also signals the importance of moral learning in organizations.",,

The former, the view that business is insulated from moral rules, is problematic because arguments used to support it force proponents to accept the idea that each aspect of life is insulated from moral rules. This idea, however, renders philosophically insignificant the claim that business has a special ethics. Proponents no longer make a claim about business, but, rather, a relativistic claim about ethics in general. The derivative conception is the view that business is a set of circumstances that bear on the application of moral rules. This, however, is true of each aspect of life, and is simply an application of the principle 'ought implies can'. The result is that there is nothing special about this sense of a special ethics. Despite lacking specialness, however, the derivative conception provides proper framing for examination of the rules governing business.

A proper conceptualization is highly relevant both for the empirical corroboration of business ethics theories and for managerial purposes, such as judging individual and group performance or informing external stakeholders. The empirical applicability of the model is illustrated by an explorative case study of a large, globally operating financial institution.

This paper considers an apparent dichotomy, with companies investing in ethical programs whose worth their employees and managers question. We examine the relationship between work, bureaucracy and ""the market"" and conclude that employees often question the existence of business ethics because there is no good and bad between which to choose. The choice is between success and failure. A common view of success and the ""good life"" is one determined by hard work in a well-organised company operating in a free market. Analysing the three aspects of this view (the free market, hard work, bureaucracy) we suggest these are mere fictions. A major problem we identify in business is that organisations are designed as profit making mechanisms and have no interest in the good of society. The challenge is to convince such organisations that a direct benefit accrues to them through their own ethical behaviour. In order to do this organisations must first be shown the importance of long termism. Executives, managers and other employees can be expected to attain high ethical standards only when they feel they are a integral part of an organisation and the organisation itself respects those standards. One of the keys to unravelling the undesirable situation of a perceived absence of ethics in business is in encouraging a greater identity community, company and workforce. We provide some examples of ways companies can meet the challenge of encouraging more ethical, long-sighted behaviour. In addition, we highlight ways in which the expectations of the organisations of the organisation can be communicated more strongly through corporate structures that foster ethical action that benefits the long term interests of the individual and the organisation. Overall implementing a successful ethical program is shown to parallel that of the implementation of a quality program.",,

The second issue is how acknowledged professionals that regularly interact with business, such as accountants, lawyers, and physicians, can find the moral free space necessary to maintain professional integrity in the face of financial pressures. Conflicts of interest for professionals working in corporations recur with disturbing regularity, and often have serious consequences. In the end I will show how both issues share a common solution. The solution involves understanding the normative function of the manager in the modern corporation, a function, I will argue, made more conspicuous by work over the last two decades done in the areas of stakeholder theory, corporate social performance (CSP), and social contract theory.

Although the social function of business ethics is implicit in leading business ethics foundation theories, it has never been presented in a systematic way. This article sets out to fill this theoretical lacuna, and to explore the theoretical potentials of a functional approach to business ethics. Key concepts from Parsonian functionalistic sociology are applied to establish the social integrative function of business ethics. This produces a theoretical framework for business ethics that provides strong theoretical arguments against often-heard criticisms of business ethics. Many of these criticisms are ideological in nature, in that they systematically play down the importance of integrative functions in the business-society relationship, on the grounds of unrealistic assumptions about the performance of economic and bureaucratic institutions. However, business ethics itself can also become ideological, if it forgets that the conditions for the application of ethics to business are not always ideal as well.",,

That is, they involve a number of distinct centers - each of which define rights and obligations of a multiplicity of affected parties - and resolving matters around one center typically creates unpredictable repercussions around one or more of the other centers. Polycentricity is a normative phenomenon especially unsuited for adjudication, often requiring recourse to alternative processes of contract (or reciprocal adjustment) and managerial direction. This study explores how such concerns about the limits of adjudication (and its various moral counterparts) apply to international decisionmaking connected to human rights obligations of multinational companies.

It also must specify (3) a decision principle that business people who accept the theory can use. It must determine (4) who the normative theory applies to and (5) whose interests need to be considered. It must also outline (6) in what contexts it applies, and (7) what legal and regulatory structures it assumes.

In order to treat these often vaguely discussed issues, a typology of international relations is proposed. These and other considerations prepare the way to ask the question about the implied ethos.

For the 1990s, he notes that the crisis came mainly in the regions of the South. In Italy, where population aging looms, the decline in the growth rate has been followed by the loss of the capacity to create jobs. The result has been the progressive exclusion of large groups of citizens from the productive process. Hence the need to foster the conditions for the expansion of economic activity through private initiative, which produces employment and an improvement in living standards. Given the globalization of markets, it is important for Italy to be able to advance in innovative industries, to offer quality products at competitive costs. The author then turns to incomes policy and the relations between labour and firms, the persistence of irregular employment, high taxation, and the efficiency and efficacy of government. Dealing with the issue of economic ethics, the author argues that ethics and law are necessary for an orderly economic life as well as for harmonious social life; business ethics, in fact, is an exigency not just of conscience but of the market, of the economy. In discussing the key factors in economic progress, he highlights human capital and the need to invest in education. The Italian educational system now has the opportunity to develop integrated systems in which State and private institutions cooperate to produce the public good or service. Revolutionary innovations are in store for the civil society of the 21st century. We are in the midst of a historic transition. Globalization has created new foundations for international cooperation. The poor countries must be sustained. A greater effort by international institutions is also needed to help the weakest economies. The author concludes that in a necessarily pluralistic context, civil society must develop actions that generate cohesion, cooperation for the common good, implying moral and spiritual values alongside economic and material ones. In the historical context of our time, we must work for a better understanding of the operation and interaction between the society, in all its components, and public institutions. Political society and civil society must supplement and complement one another, cooperating for the same ends.",,"civil society; economic development; economic growth; globalization; national economy; Italy"

In-person interviews with 348 managing directors of Irish-owned businesses who report their perceptions of the degree of wrongness of ten business ethics problems (the dependent variables) yield the data for our study. Predictors of managers' ratings include the existence of a business code of ethics, perceived frequency of occurrence of the given acts, company size and sector, union membership, Irish business ownership and independence (the independent variables). Results indicate that approximately 75% of those sampled are independent Irish owned businesses but few (only 22% of this sample) have a formal business code. Regression analyses reveal that small firms with a code of ethics predict higher wrongness ratings for managers in regard to the practices of unfair pricing and delayed payments (unethical behavior involving firms) but managers also consider such acts the least wrong overall. Wrongness ratings on the eight remaining unethical acts are explained by the manufacturing sector. However, manufacturing firms in Ireland also have a high percentage of unionised workers indicating that unions influence managerial thinking about social and employee ethics (e.g., discrimination, insider trading). The traditional adversarial Industrial Relations model is useful in noting that unions are important in setting ethical standards for indigenous Irish-owned businesses.

From antiquity until the Protestant Reformation, usury was regarded as an inherently evil activity. Today, with few exceptions, usury is met with moral indifference. Modern objections to usury are limited to protest against ""excessive"" interest rates rather than interest per se. With this change in focus, the very meaning of the term ""usury"" has also changed. Many early pronouncements against the taking of interest emphasized the plight of the poor, but ironically, the poor actually pay the highest rates of interest in the modern American economy. Despite the universality of usury, some socio-economic subcultures still manage to avoid the taking or giving of interest. Orthodox branches of both Judaism and Islam have maintained bans on usury throughout the centuries and up to the present time. This is especially interesting in the case of Judaism, given the popular cultural image of the Jew as usurer. Jewish free loan systems may actually offer a model for modern loan programs that can be designed to aid poor borrowers, who are frequently shut out of mainstream financial services.","Christian business ethics; Free loans; Islamic business ethics; Jewish business ethics; Microlending; Microloans; Pawnbroking; Usury",

At that time also there developed the idea of the firm as an institution with many targets. The position of the firm in society changed, people started to make demands for a wider social responsibility. It was desired that this responsibility would be allocated to the firm and the top management on the basis that they had the obligation to do so. In this way management as a public steward is obliged to maintain and develop social targets. Further, it was essential that firms themselves began to understand the necessity of taking responsibility. Instead of maximizing profit in the short run, this was replaced by the relevant functioning which emphasized the firm's long-term benefit. © MCB University Press.","Business; Ethics; Leadership; Management; Ownership",

The most recent clinical and epidemiological data confirm the episodic progression of this illness. These data concerning progression have given rise to a proposed model of vulnerability to psychosis. The appearence of the first signs of such an exacerbation in a hitherto stabilised patient requires the immediate institution of medico-psycho-social management strategies for the treatment of this new episode. It has been amply demonstrated that long-term maintenance therapy considerably reduces the risk of relapse. Using this model, a number of authors have proposed that schizophrenia be considered as the outcome of an interaction between permanent vulnerability of multifactorial origin and stress factors. In this theory, only episodic decompensation, and thus acute exacerbation, is modeled rather than the entire schizophrenic pathology.

The financial burden was more problematic than the effect of caring on family routines; and these two factors significantly predicted global rating of burden. The severity of patient's worries and psychopathological symptoms were not significantly correlated with care-giver global rating of burden. The tolerance shown by this group of relatives implies that they have strong potentials for playing useful roles in community care of patients.

The survey results clearly indicate that companies in New Zealand give low priorities to ethics with other values in the corporate culture. A significant number of respondents also believe that pressures from the top to achieve results and the organisational climate and ruthless competition help create an unethical environment. A greater emphasis on ethical content in the business curricula has been overwhelmingly supported by the respondents. Moreover, the majority of respondents also think that the ethical standard in New Zealand businesses has declined in the past decade. Finally, a number of suggestions have been put forward by the respondents to develop and maintain a high standard of ethical environment. These include mandatory moral/ethical education both in the educational institutions and in commerce and industry, commitment of top management and written and published code of ethics.",,

But this Broad View of moral responsibility puts us on a collision course with our considered intuitions about paternalistic acts. This paper discusses several aspects of this issue: the neutrality of the Standard View of Paternalism, the nature of the defenses of paternalistic interventions allowed by the Standard View of Paternalism and their reliance on consent; and the sort of position on paternalism the Board View would have to endorse in order to justify the benevolence-motivated orientation required by its conception of moral responsibility. The conclusion is that unless we are prepared to take a different, non-standard view of paternalism the Board View of corporate moral responsibility will be untenable.",,

Broadly, this theory posits that the ultimate objective of a business organization is to maximize its market value (often referred to as maximizing shareholder wealth). This objective is, in turn, justified (in a theory often termed ""the invisible hand"") by the premise that such activity undertaken competitively, within the law, by individual firms will lead to maximal social welfare. This view of the ultimate aims of corporate activity has come under increased scrutiny -and, indeed, challenge - by a growing body of thought that can be loosely labeled ""business ethics theory."" As business ethics theory filters into the financial professional's milieu - through, for example, corporate creeds -some confusion is inevitable.

Six distinct aspects of business ethics research are identified and assessed according to their methodological impact. Accordingly, it is argued that more interpretive approaches may offer substantial liberating potential in the development of a stronger and more theory-rich empirical base.

Unlike previous studies which examined the relationship between one single domain of social support with either mental or physical health, the present study assessed the effects of three different domains of social support on multiple measures of health. The findings of the study indicated- that social support tended to mediate the deleterious effects of non-military traumatic events; whereas the adverse consequences of traumatic events experienced in the military were not affected by social support, suggesting that stressors associated with combat had a long lasting effect on the health status of veterans. The study results revealed that compared with those with better health, respondents with poor health were more likely to have lower levels of social support, suggesting that poor health might be a barrier to a person's ability to participate and/or maintain social relationships. The study also showed that different types of social support had varying beneficial effects on different measures of health. While perceived support had a strong' effect on all the measures of health (except alcoholism) included [n the study, living arrangement had a significant effect on post- traumatic stress disorder or physical health and participation in group activities had a strong, effect only on physical functioning. The results of the study highlight the need for future research to determine whether particular types of social support affect various aspects of health differently. This simultaneous focus on multiple support functions and health outcomes is important because it provides insight into the mechanisms linking social support to health.","Self-assessed health; Social support; Stress; Trauma exposure; Veterans","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; health status; human; life event; major clinical study; male; mental stress; physical stress; posttraumatic stress disorder; self evaluation; social interaction; social status; social support; soldier; United States; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Self Assessment (Psychology); Social Behavior; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; United States; Veterans"

Today several leading companies are beginning to find inspiration in an unexpected place: the social sector. That includes public schools, welfare-to-work programs, and the inner city. Indeed, a new paradigm for innovation is emerging: a partnership between private enterprise and public interest that produces profitable and sustainable change for both sides. In this article, the author shows how some companies are moving beyond corporate social responsibility to corporate social innovation. Traditionally, companies viewed the social sector as a dumping ground for their spare cash, obsolete equipment, and tired executives. But that mind-set hardly created lasting change. Now companies are viewing community needs as opportunities to develop ideas and demonstrate business technologies; find and serve new markets; and solve long-standing business problems. They focus on inventing sophisticated solutions through a hands-on approach. This is not charity; it is R & D, a strategic business investment. The author concedes that it isn't easy to make the new paradigm work. But she has found that successful private-public partnerships share six characteristics: a clear business agenda, strong partners committed to change, investment by both parties, rootedness in the user community, links to other organizations, and a commitment to sustain and replicate the results.

Hume analyzes the problem of explaining justice in self-interested economic exchange as a problem of agents coordinating on a pattern of reciprocal cooperation, as opposed to some other behavioral pattern such as reciprocal exploitation, in exchanges repeated over time. Hume's arguments anticipate informally the contemporary interpretation of just economic practices as forming part of an equilibrium of a repeated game. I close the paper by arguing that Hume does not provide a satisfactory explanation of how the mutual expectations that support justice in economic exchange arise in a community of self-interested agents. The problem Hume leaves unsolved is one of equilibrium selection, that is: Why do agents follow an equilibrium corresponding to just economic exchanges rather than some other equilibrium corresponding to unjust exchanges? I also argue that contemporary game theory still lacks a satisfactory theory of equilibrium selection, but that such a theory would lead us closer to a satisfactory Humean reconciliation of justice and self-interest in economic exchange.",,

Absorbing workers from abroad poses serious questions concerning the moral obligations of the employers as well as the government authorities in the migrant-receiving country. Unfortunately, the moral dilemmas of foreign labor have been largely neglected by business ethics researchers. This paper develops a conceptual framework based on the multinational corporation (MNC) ethical research to help examine the moral obligations of employers and states toward foreign workers, as opposed to citizens. The main argument is that domestic employers, who have the power to affect crucial aspects in the lives of migrant workers, incur obligations to these people and bear moral responsibility for their subsistence. As regards the host country in a universal social order based on the existence of nation-states, the employment of foreign workers poses a genuine ethical dilemma between two valid moral duties: the duty to improve the welfare of nationals and the duty to promote the interests of everyone, regardless of their nationality.",,

We feel that all people should get the opportunity to realise their full human potential, i.e. to realise their own goals and aspirations. In this paper we claim that this is also part of the responsibility of private sector firms and, therefore, an integral aspect of business ethics. We first argue against the (popular) conviction that the situation of the unemployed is their own responsibility, either because they choose to be unemployed (section 2), or because they choose to be low skilled (section 3). As a consequence, we do not believe that the dismantling of the social security system or the restructuring of the educational system can fully solve the problem of the least skilled in our societies. Nor do we think that the integration of the least skilled is a matter for government policy alone. In section 4 we argue that job creation remains indispensable for a real attack on the problem of social exclusion. In section 5, we highlight the important role of the private sector in this regard. Such job creation will require a lot of effort and imagination at the micro-level of the firm and a lot of creative thinking about how to structure the macrosocial market environment within which private firms operate.","Job creation; Least-skilled; Social exclusion; Unemployment",

Evaluating corporate social performance (CSP) is important for researchers investigating the relationship between different organizational measures and CSP and for stakeholders employing social performance information in their decision making models. To assess CSP, an aggregate measure of CSP which incorporates both an independent assessment of actual performance and the individual value judgements of the stakeholder is needed. In this study, we propose a methodology for the development of a systematic measure of CSP using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This multi-criteria decision making technique allows for the conversion of a multidimensional scale to a unidimensional scale, enabling analysis/comparison of companies both within the same industry and across industries. The technique is illustrated by developing a measure of CSP using several types of managers. The results indicate that there are large rank changes when individual value judgements are incorporated using relative importance weights.",,

Such potential harms in business ethics education is due largely to restricted cognitive level of reasoning, a limited level of ethical conduct which remains only responsive and adaptive, and the estrangement between strategic thinking and ethical thinking. As a remedy for business ethics education, denatured by these potential harms, a new dynamic model of business ethics education is proposed. The new model is composed of a basic foundation for business ethics education and three practical components of business ethics education. The basic foundation comprises of ethical reasoning, moral sentiments, and ethical praxis. Three practical components of business ethics education are, respectively, to intensify moral imagination, to develop ethical wisdom and courage, and to enhance meta-strategic competences. The ultimate purpose of these practical components is to help moral subjects to conduct ethical leadership, to actualize integrity between individuals and organization, and to fulfill the social responsibility of business firms. This new model is expected to attract attention to the effective business ethics education both in college and in industry, and to be used as a benchmark for new curriculum designs and development of teaching methods. Finally, some teaching methodologies and pedagogical experiments are introduced and discussed according to this new model of business ethics educaiton.",,

In some instances, the technological solutions give rise to new environmental challenges. Forestry practices are influencing the public's perception of the kraft pulping industry, its ethical and environmental performance, its profitability, and the properties of its product, which may increase wood requirements.

While there may be issues that arise in medicine or law that require special treatment, the ways of relating to such issues are derived from a basic ethical stance. Once one has evolved such an ethical stance and thus has incorporated a fundamental mode of relating to her or his fellow human beings, the ""how"" to deal with various ethical ""issues"" will follow as a natural consequence of one's ethical stance or modality. It is not necessary, in the formation of one's fundamental ethical stance to know if one is a utilitarian or a deontologist. It is doubtful whether Buddha knew what kind of ethics he was practising. If one conceives of ethics as something extrinsic to various disciplines and attempts to first practise a discipline and then to apply ethics to modify the results of that discipline it is entirely possible that conflicts will result between what is perceived of as the proper pursuit of that discipline and the ethical considerations. The argument of this paper is that it is more efficacious (in addition to being more true) to take ethical considerations into account in the construction of the definition of the discipline. This paper is devoted to showing that business and ethics are not two different and competing fields of interest (thus requiring a discipline of business ethics to be grafted onto the study of business enterprise), but that ethical concerns are part and parcel of the very concept of a business enterprise and the internal operation of a business organization.",,

It starts by indicating why morality in business is a precondition for the legitimacy of a market economy as well as for excellence in a global market economy.

Once the necessity of moral business behaviour has been argued, the focus shifts to the main stumbling blocks that impede the development of moral business culture in newly formed democracies such as South Africa.

The results confirm that lone parents, particularly lone mothers, have poor health status relative to parents living as couples. The observed health differences mirror variations in socioeconomic circumstances. However, even when a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic circumstances are included in multivariate models, lone mothers still have significantly poorer health than couple mothers for four out of five health variables. The paper concludes by discussing alternative explanations for the health differences between lone and couple parents - such as the absence of an intimate/confiding relationship, the stress and stigma associated with becoming a lone parent and health selection - and by highlighting future options for policy and research in this area.","Lone parents; One-parent families; Self-reported health; Social relationships; Socioeconomic circumstances","article; demography; health status; human; multivariate analysis; self report; single parent; socioeconomics; Fathers; Great Britain; Health Status; Humans; Mothers; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Single Parent; Socioeconomic Factors"

The presumed ethically neutral, value-free approach of economists, who dominate business courses, is increasingly inadequate to meet the needs of business managers - or of business students. Technological and political changes, creating an interdependent environment within which managers operate, have eroded older ethics based on tradition and common backgrounds. They have also raised ethical issues of new orders of complexity. With corporate business managers finding ethical concerns more pressing matters than do many teachers, the paper offers some tentative answers to three questions about how to interest business students in ethical issues: What Approach to Business Ethics Gets Student's Attention? What Is the Value of Simulations and Games? What Can Be Said About the Business System And Its Values? The answer to the first question is simulations, and games. Case method analysis is serviceable, engaging students' intellect, but all too often without emotional involvement or self-revelation. Experiential learning through class-room games accomplish both engagement and involvement in ways that are exceedingly helpful to business students, who have had ""less occasion for critical reflection on self and world than have others of their age."" The answer to the second question is: They engage the whole student, stimulating the player to examine the source of her ethical strengths and the reasons for ethical lapses. Generating emotional involvement the games leverage and enhance reasoning, allowing students to learn more about their own values and question their own behavior. The answer to the third question is: A socially justifiable (community-legitimated) competitive market system requires of its managerial participants an emotionally informed response - as well as a rational analysis and use of business techniques. Business operates with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency at appropriate levels of such virtues as loyalty, trustworthiness and cooperativeness; they ensure externality benefits as well as promote justice for its own ultimate social justification.",,

Historically, the use of literature in examining business ethics has been focused primarily on novels such as The Jungle, Babbit, and The Great Gatsby. Plays are more useful than novels in attempting to inculcate moral and ethical values since they more sharply address the interactions of characters, and the reader becomes more involved in their situations. The plays selected for analysis, Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People, Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, have intense plots and characters and allow the reader to observe a wide range motives, emotions, and traits. This untraditional approach to teaching business ethics enhances the ability to relate to the increasingly complex ethical issues facing the individual and the organization.",,

Moral principles are fairly useful in assessing actions, but understanding how moral people behave and how they become moral requires reference to virtues, some of which are important in business. We must go beyond virtues and refer to character, of which virtues are components, to grasp the relationship between moral assessment and psychological explanation. Virtues and other character traits are closely related to (in technical terms, they supervene on) personality traits postulated by personality psychologists. They may therefore be featured in respectable psychological explanations. But good character fits no familiar psychological pattern. A person of good character is sufficiently self-aware and rational that his or her virtues are not accompanied by the vices that psychologists find usually associated with them. A course in business ethics can help develop this self-awareness, which a good life in business requires.",,

Therefore, it is argued, we must turn our attention from dominant normative and empirical trends in business ethics, which revolve around boundaries and constraints, and instead concentrate on methods for promoting ethical behavior in practice, exploiting psychological forces conducive to ethical conduct. This calls for a better understanding of how organizations and their inhabitants function, and, in turn, it points to pragmatic solutions. Ethical conduct can be promoted by (1) normatively justifying vivid aims worthy of pursuit alongside economic objectives, and (2) empirically identifying the conditions and practices that advance those aims in firms. This approach challenges us to bring empirical and normative inquiry together - in ways unsettling to both. It pushes us to move beyond an empirical preoccupation with decision making and judgment, and it requires us to cope with political liberalism's legitimate qualms about discussions of the good.",,

Yet the social relationship remains an under-utilised unit of analysis in risk behaviour research. Drawing on qualitative research with illicit drug users in London, this paper illustrates how drug users' sexual relationships act as key sites of risk management in individuals' drug use and everyday lifestyles. First, while recent research has almost exclusively focused on the dangers of disease transmission, our findings show that drug users perceived their sexual relationships as influencing a variety of risks associated with heroin and other opioid drugs. Here, two types of relationships - 'gear' and 'straight' relationships - were perceived to be particularly important. Second, while research has tended to focus on drug and health risks as an outcome of relationships, drug users' accounts emphasise that managing risks to their relationships is an important facet of everyday risk management made complicated by drug use. It is argued that risk is a product of social interactions, and that the sexual relationship is an important site of risk management in this process. Future interventions should target drug users' sexual relationships as agents of risk management and behaviour change.",,"diamorphine; illicit drug; opiate; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; article; disease transmission; drug abuse; drug use; health hazard; human; lifestyle; risk; risk assessment; risk management; sexual behavior; social interaction; united kingdom; Adult; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Life Style; London; Male; Opioid-Related Disorders; Risk-Taking; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners"

Heritage tourism offers a potential economic base to revitalise an area whose nineteenth-century wharves and port infrastructure have become redundant. The selection of Millers Point over other places occurred through the presence of artefacts dating from the nation's early European history. Marking tourist sites in Millers Point as part of a Bicentenary Project of the Royal Australian Historical Society (RAHS) inhered to this locality imaginings of Australian national identity. Within the rhetoric of 'cradle of the nation', aspects of this officially sanctioned locality that threaten the national imaginings were either suppressed, trivialised or silenced. Furthermore, these claims of national identity are appropriated, communicated and amplified within representations of the tourism industry's brochures and guidebooks. Representations of national identity within Millers Point privilege official over vernacular histories. Furthermore artefacts are prioritised over social memory, in particular first and oldest structures over all others. Finally where social memory is addressed, emphasis is given to the elite over the proletariat, men over women, Anglo-Celtic over indigenous peoples, glorious decisions over the ignoble, and an egalitarian ideology over extant social relationships. Such a selective representation of Millers Point allows conflictual and challenging elements of Australian national identity to be cast aside, leaving dominant social norms unchallenged.","Deconstruction; Heritage; Millers Point; Representations; Tourism; Waterfront revitalisation","cultural tourism; tourism economics; urban renewal; waterfront redevelopment; Australia, New South Wales, Sydney, Millers Point"

There are three main normative experiences in the traditions of Russian business: a) the experience of pre-Revolutionary business, specifically developed and practiced by the merchants of the old-believers extraction; b) the experience of socialist economy, which was more or less oriented to the public good and presupposed selfless aspirations by the economic agents; c) the experience of legally and administratively constrained private business and illegal shadow business, which expected businessmen to be vigorous, industrious and enterprising. The process of privatization was developed under the aegis of state, specifically the state bureaucracy. The influence of changes in the social-economic system has been ambivalent for social morals. However, the reforms could stimulate their improvement. The recent development in the cultural environment of business testify to the emerging space of civilized business, which manifests that it is practically useful for businessmen to be ethical.",,

The business person is, first and foremost, a member of the community, a citizen, attempting to meet the needs of that community by providing goods and services. The general public often perceives the businessperson as violating the ethical standards of the community. Business risks losing its social legitimacy by such activity. Universities are the appropriate institutions in which to inculcate the importance of ethics and should go as far as it can to influence the ethical reasoning of graduates. However, research suggests that the traditional way of integrating ethics education into required functional courses actually results in a decline in moral reasoning. It is suggested that ethics educating needs to be personalized based on the individual student and that there is a need for experiential learning methods which would supplement and enhance standard classroom based ethics education. An appropriate goal for business ethics courses would be to make students aware of the ethical and social dimensions of the business decision making process. I suggest that a service-learning pedagogy would be one way to educate the business student in ethics. An integrated service project stressing rights and responsibilities could create a feeling of what it means to be a member of a community and would emphasize the importance of social involvement.

What can be said of all these relationships is that they involve a solidarity, a concordat, a reciprocity, which has its foundation in a common field between the parties and which produces common actions or exchanges. All friendships tend to equality in the sense that they do not insist on 'what is due' as an ultimate end; friendship, like equity, surpasses justice in the fulfillment of what is owed. Because friendship fosters solidarity and justice it is politically important as a virtue-context, according to Aristotle. Is it possible that friendship can function as a virtue-context within economic life as well? Aristotle's notion of a type of useful friendship which functions through expectation of moral behavior will be shown to provide both motive and context for the performance of acts of virtue in a business setting.","Advantage; Character; Friendship; Good will; Virtue",

For example one understands what a chair is when one understands it is for sitting on. This involves understanding its purpose. One type of corporation is the for-profit-corporation. This seems to indicate that this type of corporation, the business corporation, has as its purpose to make a profit. Is that as obvious as it first appears? The favorite way for philosophers to arrive at the ""purpose"" of anything is to ask the question ""Why?"" But there are at least two answers to the question ""Why""? when addressed to a social practice such as business. One might be asking for a psychological account (explanation) of ""Why"" a person does business, and this is primarily answered by discovering the motives behind business activity; or one might be asking for a justificatory reason (justification) for the practice - what purpose legitimates business as a human activity. These two answers are often conflated and thus the purpose of business is often considered to be answered by giving the psychological account of the self-interested profit-making motive. This paper will attempt to highlight the importance of making the distinction between motive and purpose clearly, show what confusions arise when the distinction is ignored, and hint at some of the structural philosophical reasons why the distinction got blurred in the first place.","Adam Smith; Business; Ethics; Milton Friedman; Motive; Profit maximization; Purpose",

However one of the most important contributions to management practice and theory (human relations) was built upon a sociological theory that was totally concerned with morality. That sociological theory was borrowed by Mayo (the 'father' of human relations) without reading the original theory; consequently he missed the real point that the theory made, i.e. a common morality embracing everyone was necessary to maintain order and social cohesion. Such a morality was only possible when we realised our social dimension through continuous contact with each other. Moral man had to be social man; occupational groups were a way of attempting to achieve this. Yet morality is a dimension of group dynamics and management training rarely mentioned, partly through ignorance, partly through a fear of what discussions of morality might lead on to, and partly through a structural blindness to non-operational problems.",,

However, as so often in life, the rich pickings may have their own price. This article examines some of the problems which are experienced by those seeking to participate in the South China growth phenomenon, from the perspective of both Chinese and overseas enterprises. Two major issues are explored by reference to case histories. The main problems examined are: variable standards of business ethics and infrastructure struggling to keep up with the pace of growth. The Build-Operate-Transfer approach to large contracting projects is examined through an example at the heart of one of the cases. Build-Operate-Transfer offers projects 'now' for developing economies and potentially good returns for developers, provided integrity prevails. The overall picture in South China is one of good returns, but only if you work hard to avoid the pitfalls along the way.

Somehow much of the public believes that corporate responsibility has been compromised, and that regard for profits has become a way of life that overlooks humane and societal considerations.

It is our contention that these two business trends are intimately related. TQM encompasses concepts and practices that are in the best organizational interest for all stakeholders. Additionally, TQM promotes activities that encourage high moral behavior. To support this notion, consider the following six important concepts that provide a foundation for TQM: Empowerment of employees Throughput that is prompt and without defects Helpfulness of managers and employees in task accomplishment Integrity of products, services and people Change in process and behavior Stakeholder emphasis (stockholders, customers, and equity) Viewed in the above form, TQM is simply good ethics put into practice.",,

The core belief is that business managers, even in their role as managers, have responsibilities to society beyond profit maximization. Managers, in pursuing their primary goal of increasing shareholder value, have social responsibilities in addition to meeting the minimal requirements of the law. Nevertheless, the call for increased social responsibility on the part of business managers remains controversial. At least two major perspectives on social responsibility can be isolated. The classical view, most closely identified with Milton Friedman, suggests that social responsibility is incompatible with a free enterprise economy. By contrast, advocates of increased social responsibility point out the desirability for voluntary (and at times costly) corporate activities which promote society's well being. The purpose of this essay is to briefly describe both the classical and pro-social responsibility perspectives. We suggest that while important differences in assumptions characterize the two distinct views, there is enough overlap and agreement to move the debate beyond the current stalemate. Specifically, we argue that the concept of lifnim mishurat hadin, an innovative and ancient Jewish legal doctrine which is usually translated as ""beyond the letter of the law"", might serve as a model for modern legal and social thought. We examine talmudic and post-talmudic sources which apply this concept to the area of business ethics, and explore its applicability to the modern situation. Although the business ethics literature rarely refers to Talmudic and rabbinic sources, these texts reflect a sophisticated understanding of business practices and ethical problems.",,

The nurses' views were considerably at variance with the officially stated commitment to inter-disciplinary collaboration and coordination within the Community Care Programmes of Ireland's regional health boards. The PHNs feared that involvement in child care proceedings of a social control or adversarial nature would compromise them in terms of their traditional curative and preventive health roles, and, on this basis, argued that social workers should retain the bulk, if not all, of the responsibility for such child care activity. The nurses also defined their work roles in terms of their own traditional, professional commitment to individuals, families and communities, and felt less bound by or even aware of the corporate responsibility of their employing health board. It is concluded that the enactment of new legislation and allocation of additional resources do not resolve the issues of inter-disciplinary collaboration in this area.","Child protection; Child welfare; Community care; Public health nurses; Social workers","article; child care; child welfare; community care; human; ireland; law; nurse; responsibility; social control; social worker; Adolescent; Attitude of Health Personnel; Child; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Female; Focus Groups; Health Care Rationing; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Ireland; Male; Patient Care Team; Public Health Nursing; Social Work"

Prior research of Dornoff and Tankersley (1985-1976), Gifford and Norris (1987), Norris and Gifford (1988), and Burns and Rayman (1989) examined the ethics orientation of retail sales persons, sales managers, and business school students. These studies found the college students less ethically-oriented than retail sales people and retail managers. The present study attempts to extend the research on ethics formation to a geographically and academically diverse sample, and to determine if retail management experience in the form of a professional practicum or internship, or entry level management training programs, such as experienced by recent graduates, are critical factors in the formation of business ethics. The sample consisted of thirty-three students majoring in Human Ecology with a concentration in Retail Merchandising and 51 recent graduates of the retail Merchandising program. The series of fourteen vignettes developed by Dornoff and Tankersley (1975-1976) was used. An acknowledged limitation of this study is the validity of the questionnaire developed by Dornoff and Tankersley due to the method of development and new laws concerning warranties and credit etc. which have occurred since 1976. The instrument was used, however, to maintain consistency with earlier studies for the purpose of comparison of groups. No significant differences were found in the students' perceptions of the fourteen actions presented in the vignettes, but the range of the responses in the post-internship tests increased in many cases. The alumni appeared to be slightly more ethical than the students but not as ethical as the managers surveyed in 1986 by Morris and Gifford. Indications are that the critical point of ethics formation may be at the mid-management level and that internships and management training programs have little effect on the ethical perceptions of participants. These findings are consistent with studies such as Gable and Topol (1988), and Jordan and Davis (1990) which showed high Machiavellian scores among young retailing executives, often buyers, as opposed to upper level retailing management. Scales with measure Machiavellianism, or manipulativeness, have been used as an alternative method of examining business ethics.",,

For an organization's commitment to ecologically beneficent performance to be credible, one requires an action plan with specified targets determining the best ecologically beneficent pollution abatement and ecosystem improvement approaches in a situation. To this end the 4 Direct Environmental Performance Measures (EPMs) are generally used: L, pollutant loads; C: pollutant concentrations; I, ecosystem impacts; and R, ecosystem restoration. These direct EPMS are preferred to the indirect social performance indices customary in business ethics discourse, such as O: positioning organizations along the social performance spectrum from reactive to proactive; or E: economic indicators; and T: technology development; for environmental performance improvement is what is at issue. This one ground rule of environmental performance ethic; a second is that reducing harmful impacts or restoring an ecosystem are to be preferred over pollutant load/concentration reduction. The scientific, technical form of Direct EPMs is important, for it reinforces economic and technological development and yields performance-related environmental knowledge, in contrast to subjective perception and social debate. It offers management a model of ecologically beneficent performance that is microscopic in detail and regional in scope. It further suggests good environmental management involves linking ecosystem improvement with economic/technological benefits. An important aspect of this model of good environmental performance is to integrate economic, technical and social concerns with environmental ethics. It shows that economics and ecology should be mutually reinforcing, just as sustainable development suggests.",,

A questionnaire survey of senior executives in U.K. insurance companies was undertaken to explore the implementation of ethical policies and codes, to investigate ethical attitudes, and to analyze the extent to which these policies and attitudes varied among companies. The results suggest that ethical policies have a higher profile and ethical attitudes and behaviour are more positive in mutual as opposed to stock insurance companies. These findings support the contention that a strong corporate ethical culture may be utilised to enhance formal corporate governance instruments.",,

Although regarded by many critics as a parochial deliberation, the US remains the single largest destination for, and source of, foreign investment. Any shift away from the historic policy of open access, a principle coined by the term 'national treatment', would therefore seriously undermine attempts to sustain or expand an open investment regime. The article outlines the evolving policy options currently being debated by policy makers in the United States and then analyzes the behavior of the affiliates of foreign investors in the United States. The evidence presented by Reich suggests that tremendous variations are evident in patterns of investment according to the nationality of the affiliate, with significant implications for both the value of such investments to the US economy, and for the future direction of US domestic policy. The evidence presented indicates that investments by Japanese affiliates prove least beneficial to the US economy as measured by either the transfer of technology or of highly skilled manufacturing jobs to the United States, compared to other major investors. The sustained reliance by Japanese affiliates on traditional business practices that emphasize investment as a conduit for further trade defies the expectations of traditional liberal 'product cycle' theory, and may partially explain the resilience of the bilateral trade deficit. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical implications for US policy makers, as well as those for maintaining an open investment regime should these policy makers abandon a policy of national treatment.","American manufacturing base; Competitiveness; Foreign direct investment; Regime theory",

The key to the approach developed here is the thesis that the distinctive ethical principles applicable to bureaucratic organizations are responses to the distinctive agency-risks that arise from the nature of bureaucratic organizations as complex webs of principal/agent relationships. It is argued that the most important and distinctive ethical principles for bureaucratic organizations express commitments on the part of bureaucrats that function to reduce the agency risks that are inherent in such organizations. This approach to the ethics of bureaucratic organizations is shown to be more illuminating than those that concentrate exclusively or primarily on determining the conditions for corporate responsibility or on the idea that the ethical obligations distinctive of bureaucracies are role-derived.",,

As a predictor of behavior, CMD has been attacked on the theoretical level, and its empirical performance has been weak. This article uses another established construct, which seems to satisfy the central criticisms of CMD, as a means of testing those complaints.

In the first part of this paper we seek to motivate the research task. The importance of conducting ethical analysis is stressed. In the second part of the paper several ethical theories: utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics are presented. This part serves as a basis for research interviews, e.g. it is possible to examine retailers' opinions about their professional virtues, and try to position these opinions in relation with utilitarianism and deontology. In the third part the empirical findings about the retailing business ethics are set forth. This part suggests that there prevails among retailers some kind of confusion about what are ethical issues and what is not ethical in their daily professional practices. To avoid this confusion four main principles were put forth by the Finnish retailers. The principles were: 1. Freedom versus rules; 2. Principles versus moralizing; 3. Boundaries versus transition; 4. Economy and moral versus subjective judgment. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Alternatively, the prescriptive literature has centred on the pedagogical issues of teaching ethics (e.g., Hunt and Bullis, 1991; Strong and Hoffman, 1990; Reeves, 1990; Castro, 1989; George, 1987; Golen et al., 1985) and in providing recommendations for teachers of business ethics (e.g., Nappi, 1990; Hosmer and Steneck, 1989). From the analytical perspective judgments have been made as to whether courses in ethics are in fact effective in achieving value and attitudinal modifications in students (e.g., Loeb, 1991; Weber, 1990; Wynd and Mager, 1989; Pamental, 1989; Martin, 1982; Purcell, 1977).

In particular, company representatives were asked if their company was institutionalising ethics, why this initiative was undertaken, how this was taking place and what specific issues were being addressed in the institutionalisation process. The results suggest that perceptions of external parties were the primary motivation for ethics institutionalisation efforts although there was also considerable focus on trying to internalise ethical values. In terms of how ethics were being institutionalised the responding companies were more likely to have conducted ethics training programs than to have written Codes of Conduct and in general it appears that few companies were developing comprehensive formal ethics programs.

We should not assume that we can say anything meaningful about ""business ethics"". One reason for this arises from the Australian experience of the '80s: the fruits of a profound cynicism are now with us, as prominent figures find themselves in court to defend their actions, and seem amazed that they are accused of doing anything wrong at all. We may want to stop something like this from happening again, but if the language of business ethics meant nothing to these people, how can we hope that it will mean much to us, or to future generations? A second reason (or group of reasons) arises from the nature of ethics itself. Business ethics, after all, does not exist in a vacuum; its language will not mean much to people who do not agree on what they mean whenever they talk about right and wrong. Some people, for example, measure the rightness or wrongness of actions in terms of their consequences; for others, on the other hand, some actions are wrong, no mater what the consequences. How are they to talk to each other? What is at issue here is what ethical propositions mean, and how one can measure their truth. And there is another reason. As Socrates pointed out long ago, ethics is not a theoretical science, which can be taught and learnt as dispassionately as mathematics. It is practical, and so engages teacher and pupil in an entirely different way: one cannot say one thing, and do another.

These programmes are based on an application of the work of Kohlberg and that of Rest.

Drawing on Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development, the paper focuses on, and draws attention to, another more positive aspect of ethics: the capacity of ethics to inspire and empower individuals, as well as groups. To understand and facilitate such empowerment, it is argued that it is necessary to move beyond Kohlberg's justice reasoning so as to appreciate the value and importance of feeling and care. Accordingly, we draw upon case study material to review the meaning of Kohlberg's higher stages - 5, 6 and 7 - to question the meaning of ethical 'reasoning'. With such deeper understanding of particular ethical codes or practices, it is thought that members of organisations may come closer to the spirit, as opposed to the letter, of ethical conduct in organisations. This, we argue, is consistent with the degree of trust and integrity demanded by leaner, post-bureaucratic ways of organizing and conducting business as well as being personally beneficial to the people involved. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

These theories may be largely uninterpretable or unacceptable to non-Western populations owing to different traditions, religious beliefs, or cultural histories. As economic boundaries collapse and markets become more global in scope, traditional Western ethical thought may lead to clashes among Western organizations and companies from differing cultural settings. Such clashes could lead to alienation of foreign customers, firms and governments and resultant competitive disadvantage, or to an abandonment of ethical considerations altogether in the struggle to compete internationally. This paper puts forward two general alternatives to Western ethical philosophies as useful frameworks for the analysis of international ethical dilemmas. The first alternative uses new organizational economics, while the second emphasizes role relationships and organizational citizenship. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

It is argued that the case-study approach is more appropriate to inquiries into the complex, diverse contents and contexts of business ethics. Investigatory case study in particular can do much to rectify the inadequacies of the prevailing positivist paradigm by evolving grounded theoretical questions for further research. Case study offers an alternative to the measurement of ethical behaviour, i.e., naturalistic generalisation which is rooted in the context of organisational cultures and economic systems.

In addition, this paper asserts that any of several stakeholder management processes can readily include the natural environment as one or more stakeholders of organizations.

Self-described behavior from the constituent groups is quite similar, yet is decidedly different from that which respondents felt others would do. Undergraduate business students tended to have the lowest estimation of others' ethics in addition to the least ethical self-described behavior compared with other constituent groups. All constituents were solidly in favor of improving ethics by developing principles of business ethics, requiring ethics courses in business schools and introducing industry codes of ethics. People are much more ethical than they are perceived to be. Knowing that others are more ethical may in turn cause other people to act more ethically.

Individuals may have social responsibilities according to Friedman, but not corporations. When executives make contributions to address social problems in the name of the corporation, they are doing so with other people's (shareholders') money. The responsibility of corporate executives is a fiduciary one, to serve as an agent for the corporation's shareholders, and to uphold shareholders' trust, which requires executives to maximize the return to their shareholders, who can then, if they choose, contribute their own money to worthy causes. Of course, shareholders face the decision problems inherent in the classic ""prisoners' dilemma,"" where the choices that are collectively sensible are individually unreasonable. Given their dilemma, shareholders should not expect to be able to control executives sufficiently to make them perfect agents, dutifully seeking to maximize shareholder profits in every decision. But, at least as an ideal, Friedman would argue that executives should serve as perfect agents and should not reduce corporate profits by contributing to social causes. Friedman's critics have focused on the assumptions implicit in Friedman's conceptual framework, one of the more important of which is that executives have no other fiduciary responsibility other that the one they have with their shareholders. The purpose of this paper is to stay within Friedman's conceptual framework and, at the same time, the question Friedman's view on the social responsibility of business, even as an ideal. We do this by focusing directly on how managers will behave, given their status as agents and the extant costs shareholders must incur to closely monitor their executives, and then drawing on important conceptual insights regarding the inefficient provision of community or public goods, best articulated by Friedman himself. Friedman has argued that contributions to many social problems generate positive neighborhood, or spillover, effects. Because of these positive spillovers, a prisoners' dilemma exists with collective rationality calling for everyone to contribute to the solution of a social problem, but with it being irrational from the perspective of each individual to make such a contribution. Once this prisoners' dilemma is recognized, the possibility exists that all shareholders would be worse off if the shareholders of each corporation had the ability to exert perfect control over their corporate agents, thereby preventing them from violating Friedman's prescription for social responsibility by making corporate contributions in excess of profit maximizing levels. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

While this approach has strong intellectual roots in moral philosophy and religion, it fails in explaining the persistence of unethical and illegal behavior among corporations of all sizes, financial health, competitive market conditions, and, level of individual executive compensation. This paper argues for a fundamentally different approach to understanding ethical behavior, or lack thereof, among corporations and their executives. It is asserted that an overwhelmingly large rationale and/or inducement for proactive ethical business behavior is rooted in competitive aspects of particular markets, and industry structures prevailing in those markets. Furthermore, while highly competitive markets may promote efficiency, they do not guarantee ethical behavior and may indeed provide greater opportunities and incentives for unethical business behavior. Thus, by following the current prognosis, we could be wasting enormous resources in terms of teaching business ethics, and creating and imposing corporate codes of conduct. We assert that these approaches would at best make a marginal improvement in the ethical performance of corporations while at the same time exacerbate the problem by ignoring more fundamental, structural issues. Imperfect markets, with their above-market profits, are a necessary but insufficient condition for corporations to behave ethically. It is only under conditions of imperfect markets that individual executives can play an important role in guiding their corporations toward greater ethical norms. These are undertaken for a variety of reasons, including, protecting a corporation's good name, public expectations, competitive norms, and, corporate culture and individual executive's predilections, to name a few. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

This essay, written as a lecture for MBA students, first reviews Pareto optimality as an argument in favor of market allocations.

In fact it has been a topic of common interest to both researchers and top managers since the mid fifties; the focus adjusting to issues and problems of the times. The authors of the article list four themes they believe to be of relevance for future discussion. First, ethics as an instrument of business behavior is entering a new dimension due to negative side effects of economic activities, which are even observed on a global scale and where it is doubtful that governments can adequately manage this complex environment. From this view, ethics becomes a decisive component of efficiency and requires a new way of thinking on the development of the market system and on a new delineation of responsibilities between government and markets. Second, in the process of transformation of the East-European states it seems to be all the more important to emphasize the ethical characteristics which are part of the concept of competition - the gains to the consumer due to the plurality of search and discovery procedures, the capability to correct and absorb wrong decisions, and the specific distributional ethics. Third, business ethics as an element of the firm's ""guiding vision"" has to be incorporated into its corporate culture, which will foster an institutional ethic of the firm - the joint effect of individual ethics within the history of the firm coupled with time and experience. Fourth, conflicting business philosophies must be judged with reference to the process of communication of business ethics. Summing up business ethics has a micro and macro component and is related to the individual firm as well as to the structure of the economic and social order.

Particularly well documented is the existence of ethical conflict at work and the reported inseparability of business decisions and moral consequences. However, to date, the majority of studies have been conducted in the American business context. This paper examines the concept of ethical conflict as experienced by employees in the Australian context. According to a sample of Western Australian managers, ethical conflicts at work do occur - with relative frequency. Of considerable concern is the high incidence of cases where the demands of superiors are deemed to be the cause of this conflict. This finding is particularly disturbing as superiors are also the primary influence on employee ethical decision making. It would see that the ethics role models are also the instigators of unethical behaviour. This research has confirmed in the Western Australian context that the values of top management do have significant impact on the ethical choices made by employees. The management of organisational culture, therefore, is a key to raising ethical standards in business. The institutionalisation of ethics by such formal means as codes of ethics is a necessary, but insufficient, condition of ensuring ethical behaviour in organisations. Management of the informal climate is pivotal to the achievement of ethical organisational behaviour. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

In particular, the paper suggests that the use of corporate social responsibility for public relations ends raises moral problems over the motivation of corporations. The paper cautions that the justifications which corporations employ may either be immoral or inaccurate with regard to the empirical evidence gained from a small-scale qualitative study carried out in the UK at a time when the practice of corporate social responsibility was expanding quickly (1989). It is noticeable, in retrospect, that great emphasis is placed upon environmental rather than social responsibility. This implies that organisations are primarily reactive in their development of corporate social responsibility programmes and that they respond to external pressures rather than working out the nature of their corporate responsibilities. It might suggest that corporations only take such actions when they feel compelled to do so by consumerist and environmentalist lobbies. The paper argues that corporations do need to find moral justifications for their moral activities and to ensure that corporate social responsibility practice lives up to the claims made by public relations practitioners. The paper explores the nature of public relations and illustrates how its responsibility for corporate social responsibility extends beyond truthfulness in publicity. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

This is not only true of our post-modern culture in general, but also of business culture specifically. In this paper I start by explaining how modernist rationality has produced moral dissensus without offering any hope of bringing an end to it in the foreseeable future. Opting for a form of post-modernist rationality as the only viable way of dealing with moral dissensus, I then make an analysis of a number of ways proposed by both specialists in the field of business ethics, as well as philosophers to deal with moral decision-making in this situation of moral dissensus. The conclusion reached is that none of these attempts succeeds in coming to terms with moral dissensus. I then formulate an alternative approach to moral decision-making which I call: ""Rational interaction for moral sensitivity"". After explaining this approach, I defend it against some of the most obvious objections that might be raised against it in a business environment. When you're talking birth control, what blocks it and freezes it out is that it's not a matter of more or fewer babies being argued. That's just on the surface.

You can prove the practicality of planned parenthood till you get tired of listening to yourself and it's going to get nowhere because your antagonist isn't buying the assumption that anything socially practical is good per se.

Networks are an important aspect of drug injectors' social environment. We distinguish between (1) risk networks (the people among whom HIV risk behaviors occur) as vectors of disease transmission, and (2) social networks (the people among whom there are social interactions with a mutual orientation to one another) as generators and disseminators of social influence. These concepts are applied to analyses of data from interviews with drug injectors in two studies. In the first study drug injectors' risk networks converge with their social networks: 70% inject or share syringes with a spouse or sex partner, a running partner, or with friends or others whom they know. Qualitative data from interviews with injectors in the second study also show that the social relationships between drug injectors and members of their risk network are often based on long-standing and multiplex relationships, such as those based on kinship, friendship, marital and sexual ties, and economic activity. In the first study the vast majority of injectors, over 90%, have social ties with non-injectors. Injectors with more frequent social contacts with non-injectors engage in lower levels of injecting risk behavior. Risk settings may function as risk networks: injectors in this study who inject at shooting galleries are more likely than those who do not to rent used syringes, borrow used syringes and inject with strangers. Since the adoption of a network approach is relatively new, a number of issues require further attention. These include: how to utilize social networks among drug injectors to reduce risk through peer pressure; how to promote risk reduction by encouraging ties between injectors and non-injectors; and how to integrate biographical and historical change into understanding network processes. Appropriate methodologies to study drug injectors' networks should be developed, including techniques to reach hidden populations, computer software for managing and analyzing network data bases, and statistical methods for drawing inferences from data gathered through dependent sampling designs. © 1993.","AIDS; drug injectors; HIV; IDUs; injecting drug users; networks; risk networks; social networks","article; data analysis; drug abuse; health behavior; health hazard; human; human immunodeficiency virus infection; human relation; intravenous drug administration; risk management; social aspect; sociology; virus transmission; Adult; Female; HIV Infections; Human; Male; Peer Group; Risk-Taking; Social Environment; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

It's not that managers dislike the idea of doing the right thing. As University of Toronto Assistant Professor Andrew Stark argues, far too many business ethicists just haven't offered them the practical advice they need. Before business ethics became a formal discipline, advocates of corporate social responsibility claimed that the market would ultimately reward ethical behavior. But ethics and interests did not always intersect so fruitfully in the real world. And when they did not, managers were left in the dark to grope for the right ethical course. In the 1970s, the brand-new field of business ethics came onto the scene to address this issue. Critical of the ""ethics pays"" approach, academics held that ethics and interests can and do conflict. Still, scholars took an equally unrealistic line. To them, a manager's motivation could be either altruistic or self-interested, but never both. In short, ethicists still weren't addressing the difficult moral dilemmas that managers face on a day-to-day basis, and only recently have they begun to do so. After some initial stumbles, ethicists are getting their hands dirty and seriously considering the costs of doing the right thing. Finally, a new business ethics is emerging that acknowledges and accepts the messy world of mixed motives. As a result, novel concepts are springing up: moderation, pragmatism, minimalism, among others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,"administrative personnel; article; Canada; commercial phenomena; ethics; organization; social behavior; social psychology; standard; United States; Administrative Personnel; Canada; Commerce; Decision Making, Organizational; Ethics, Institutional; Social Responsibility; Social Values; United States"

In this context, reference has been made to a selection of the writings of some of the more well-known writers of this period. The paper ends on a nonpositive note, raising the (rhetorical) question, that if, after two thousand years people are still continuing to engage in sharp business practices whenever the occasion arises is there any point in developing and offering courses in moral behavior and business ethics? © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Much of the analysis of these violations focuses on either these managers'lack of operational principles or their willingness to abandon principles in the face of competitive pressures. Much of the attention by firms and business schools focuses either on the articulation of operational principles (a deontological approach) or on the training of managers to sort their way through subtle ethical dilemmas in the face of competitive pressure (a utilitarian approach). While valuable, these approaches alone are incomplete. This paper suggests that many ethical violations by upper managers are the by-product of success - not of competitive pressures. Our research suggests that many managers are poorly prepared to deal with success. First, success often allows managers to become complacent and to lose focus, diverting attention to things other than the management of their business. Second, success, whether personal or organizational, often leads to privileged access to information, people or objects. Third, with success usually comes increasingly unrestrained control of organizational resources. And fourth, success can inflate a manager's belief in his or her personal ability to manipulate outcomes. Even individuals with a highly developed moral sense can be challenged (tempted?) by the ""opportunities"" resulting from the convergence of these dynamics. We label the inability to cope with and respond to the by-products of success ""the Bathsheba Syndrome,"" based on the account of the good King David (a story familiar in a variety of traditions). Recognition of this phenomenon implies that we change or broaden our approach to the teaching of business ethics. It also implies that organizations must re-evaluate and change structures, procedures, and practices which enhance the likelihood of managers falling victim to the Bathsheba Syndrome. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

While effective strategies help implement ethical decisions that are formulated in good faith, ostensibly value-neutral control mechanisms can indirectly affect the substantive nature of policies and decisions themselves. This article examines the effectiveness of various corporate social responsibility implementation strategies. It also addresses the effects of implementation choices on the substantive formulation of ethical decisions and policies. Implementation and evaluation of corporate social responsibility programs through models of responsiveness are integrated into the social policy cycle using four tools: strategic control and performance control approaches, and hierarchical control and contractual control structures. The choices made among these forms of control approaches and structures, which as implementation mechanisms are typically considered to be value-free devices, may affect the substance of corporate social responsibility content. Hierarchical control structures, which use outside directors, tend to be associated with performance control approaches, and are biased towards applying utilitarian approaches to ethical decision making. Contractual control structures are compatable with strategic control approaches, and generally favor the application of principle-based approaches to ethical decision-making. Both the content and the quality of ethical decisions will be affected by differences between hierarchical and contractual control. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Fraudulent adulteration of basic foodstuffs, the use of preservatives and colorants, and bacterial contamination are examined successively to show that by 1900 the majority of basic foods were legally pure, but that 'legalized adulteration' with chemicals was widespread, even increasing. The improvement in food quality in the later Victorian period is generally attributed to advances in food chemistry, and the skill and professionalism of food analysts operating within new regulatory frameworks.

It was hypothesised that exposure to housing stressors would be significantly related to psychological distress, but that the adverse effects of housing stressors would be moderated by perceptions of social support resources. In other words, the stress/symptom relationship would be attenuated for individuals who believe that they have active and supportive social relationships. The results of a study conducted in the two New Zealand cities of Auckland and Christchurch partially confirmed this hypothesis, indicating that social support plays a role in mitigating the adverse effects of housing stressors. However, this relationship depends on the severity of the housing stressors. Among our respondents, the presence of social support was indeed associated with reduced symptom levels for those exposed to moderate housing stressors. However, among respondents subjected to high levels of housing stressors, social support was not associated with reduced psychological distress, indicating the need for a more specific policy response to the issue of seriously deficient housing. © 1993.","housing and health; housing stressors; mental health; New Zealand; psychological distress; social support","adult; article; comparative study; data analysis; distress syndrome; female; housing; human; hypothesis; male; new zealand; normal human; perception; policy; social behavior; social interaction; social work; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Depression; Female; Housing; Human; Hypochondriasis; Male; New Zealand; Poverty; Public Assistance; Social Environment; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Urban Population"

Writers on business ethics have not appreciated that work is often organized differently in different stages of the life cycle of a firm. In this paper it is argued that the conceptions of fairness applied to a mature firm are often not applicable to a fledgling one. In a mature firm authority and responsibility are typically delegated and divided into specific jobs with relatively rigid boundaries. Thus, it has been argued that fairness in hiring requires specific job descriptions, fairness in remuneration requires standardized and graded salaries, and fairness in due process requires peer review. However, in the formative stages of a corporation, there may be very little differentiation or specialization. There is a continual re-definition of individual tasks through interaction with others as knowledge about products, production, and consumer demand are acquired by trial and error in the marketplace. Fairness takes a different form in this firm. The principle that similar people are to be treated similarly and different people differently can be operationalized in two ways. The mature firm typically focuses on differences; a fledgling, entrepreneurial one on similarities. How some of the issues of fairness in hiring, pay, and due process need to be reformulated once they are placed within the context of an entrepreneurial firm with its emphasis on similarity are then discussed. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

The questionnaire upon which the research was based was originally used by Preble and Reichel (1988) in an investigation they undertook into the attitudes towards business ethics held by two similar groups of United States and Israeli business students. The specific purpose of the current investigation was to administer the same questionnaire with one minor modification to: (1) two groups of Curtin University students; (2) a group of Asian students from the Australian Institute of Business and Technology (AIBT), a privately funded tertiary institution affiliated with Curtin University; and (3) a group of managers from the Australian Institute of Management (AIM), many of whom would not have been university graduates. The questionnaire was preceded by a profile inventory to establish the participant's age, sex, occupation, course of study, whether or not they were born in Australia, their attitudes towards religion, and whether or not they saw themselves as ethically minded persons. In the original questionnaire, Preble and Reichel had asked the US and Israeli students to indicate on a five point scale, their attitudes towards a selection of business ethics situations by reflecting on thirty statements. In the replicate study, the means and standard deviations of each response of the four groups of Western Australian students were calculated and then compared with the means and standard deviations of the US and Israeli students. In summary, statistically significant differences in the scores of the original study were noted between nineteen out of thirty of the US and Israeli students in their attitudes towards business ethics. However, ""a closer examination and interpretation showed several of these differences to have little meaning."" (p. 946) The purpose of this current study therefore, was to see if the Curtin, AIBT and AIM students' results were statistically significant (different) to the US and Israeli student scores. The implications of understanding the way a selected group of business students in Western Australia react towards a range of ethical issues ought to have relevance for those involved in developing management education courses, particularly in view of the current economic and business climate. Studies into attitudes towards ethical issues in business have, as yet, received little attention in Australasia.

In the present study, data was collected from college students and practicing accountants regarding how they and others would respond to ten ethical scenarios. Participants' perceptions were calculated and correlated to their decision in a hypothetical business case. Analysis indicated that individuals, regardless of age, gender, or work status, see themselves acting far more ethically than others. It also disclosed significant association between participants' own attitudes and the case response, but no significant association between the response and their attitudes relative to those perceived to be held by others.

With respect to concerns about fairness in organizations, utilitarian claims that people believe that fairness requires distributions of reward based on merit were assessed. Similarly, evidence was reviewed bearing on the claim of psychological egoists that judgments of fairness reflect a self-interested bias. Finally, Kant's view that people should never lie was evaluated in light of evidence describing people's actual attitudes toward lying. In all three cases, the underlying philosophical premises were concluded to be overly simplistic in view of complexities about human nature revealed in empirical research. In addition, evidence was reviewed that shed light on the teleological claims of utilitarians regarding the purported benefits of following two common organizational practices - using merit-based pay, and punishing harmdoers. Here, too, the empirical evidence (findings that these techniques do not consistently yield the greatest good for the greatest number) suggests that the premise underlying utilitarian thought is based on unfounded, overly simplistic assumptions about the effects of following various allegedly moral ideas.

The intent of the survey was to determine whether or not age or gender played a role in a person's perception of proper ethical conduct. The findings suggests that gender is a significant factor in the determination of ethical conduct and that females are more ethical than males in their perception of business ethical situations. Students were divided into groups according to age as follows: under 21 years, 22-30 years, 31-40 years, and 40 plus years. The results of this survey also suggest that age is a determining factor in making ethical decisions.

There is no lack of theories and ideals on moral reasoning. What is missing is translating these moral theories and principles into specific, operational procedures that can indicate a proper course of action. Although most business actions are routine and do not raise serious ethical questions, many people experience difficulty in applying their personal moral principles to specific business decisions in ethically-dilemmatic situations. This study seeks to develop a framework that can be utilized to implement personal moral reasoning based on the teleological theory of Utilitarianism and the deontological theory of Ross's Prima Facie Duties in the business decision-making process. The central feature in the framework is a point-system that quantities the ethical worth of a proposed business action and determines whether the action would be ethically desirable if taken. It provides an objective element in an otherwise qualitative ethical inquiry process. This study also illustrates practical applications of the system by analyzing the ethical implications of a proposed action where foreign bribery is involved. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Using a social epidemiological approach, much research has shown the beneficial effect of social supports on health and health behaviors. Family interaction research, which has grown out of a more clinical tradition, has shown the complex effects of family functioning on health, particularly mental health. No studies have examined the relative power of these two approaches in explicating the connections between social relationships and health. We hypothesized that social relationships (social support and family functioning) would exert direct and indirect (through depressive symptoms) effects on health behaviors. We also hypothesized that the effects of social relationships on health would be more powerfully explicated by family functioning than by social support. We mailed a pilot survey to a random sample of patients attending a family practice center, including questions on depressive symptoms, cardiovascular health behaviors, demographics, social support using the ISEL scale, and family functioning using the FEICS scale. FEICS is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess family emotional involvement and criticism, the media elements of family expressed emotion. Eighty-three useable responses were obtained. Regression analyses and structural modelling showed both direct and indirect statistically significant paths from social relationships to health behaviors. Family criticism was directly associated (standardized coefficient = 0.29) with depressive symptoms, and family emotional involvement was directly associated with both depressive symptoms (coefficient = 0.35) and healthy cardiovascular behaviors (coefficient = 0.32). The results support the primacy of family functioning factors in understanding the associations among social relationships, mental health, and health behaviors. The contrasting relationships between emotional involvement and depressive symptoms on the one hand and emotional involvement and health behaviors on the other suggest the need for a more complex model to understand the connections between social relationships and health. © 1992.","depressive symptoms; family functioning; health behavior; social support","article; cardiovascular system; demography; depression; emotion; family; health; health behavior; human; life event; mental health; social interaction; social work; Adult; Epidemiologic Methods; Family; Female; Health Behavior; Health Status; Human; Interpersonal Relations; Life Change Events; Middle Age; Pilot Projects; Regression Analysis; Role; Social Support"

This movement now begins to give rise to a new organizational model, the ""Self-Moralizing Corporation,"" which transcends existing paradigms of corporate rectitude. The tenets of the ""Self-Moralizing Corporation"" are that: (a) the moral behavior of members is a requisite to the attainment of organization goals; (b) individual moral behavior is an asset which must be managed and developed by the corporation; (c) individual moral development is a collectively and individually shared responsibility; and, (d) the maintenance of moral values is more important than the preservation of organization structure. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Several studies suggest that courses like business ethics and business and society might have an effect on the ethical awareness or ethical reasoning of business students. A belief of many individuals interested in business ethics is that students must be exposed to ethical awareness and ethical reasoning in business ethics and business and society-type courses and this should be supplemented by discussions of these topics in various business courses such as Accounting, Finance, Marketing, and others. This study reports the results of integrating a unit of business ethics into eleven accounting classes at two universities. An approach for measuring the effect of ethics integration into accounting and other business courses is suggested, and an assessment is made of the impact of ethics integration on students in accounting classes.

As such, business ethics presupposes a difference between an individual's experience within a business organization and his or her experience outside the organization. But how do we examine this difference? How do we discuss an individual's experience of ""everyday reality""? What processes create and sustain this reality, and how does one's version of ""reality"" affect what is, and what is not, ethical? This paper outlines an approach to these questions based on theory from the sociology of knowledge, an approach which makes some progress towards making business ethics more existential. The sociology of knowledge, and particularly the social constructionist perspective, is concerned with how an institution creates ""knowledge"" and how this ""knowledge"" affects the cognitive processes of the individuals who make up the institution. The dialectic nature of the interdependent processes which shape both the individual and the organization are important in understanding how business ethics, as one kind of social knowledge, are enacted. Examining these processes leads to several interesting hypotheses about the nature of both the study and practice of business ethics.XXX""Only individuals have a sense of responsibility."" - Friedrich Nietzsche © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Using multivariate methods to examine predictors of survival, two clinical factors, pathologic nodal status and clinical stage of disease, were significantly associated with survival. In addition we found significant and indepedent effects on survival of: number of supportive friends, number of supportive persons, whether the woman worked, whether she was unmarried, the extent of contact with friends and the size of her social network. Thus, the woman's social context, particularly contexts of friendship and work outside the home, are statistically important for survival.

Of 461 possible respondents, 230 questionnaires (a 49.6% response rate) indicated that the profession's own rule setting body (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and the use of peer review were perceived as the most effective mechanisms, while government regulation was ranked least. Respondents also evaluated the extent to which ethics should be covered in the accounting curriculum. For every course, the CPAs believed a greater emphasis on ethics is appropriate than presently exists. Suggestions for more effectively integrating ethics into accounting courses are made. Finally, respondents were also asked whether in answering the questionnaire they used a definition of ethics as either the ""Professional Code of Conduct"" or a ""moral and philosphical framework for guiding beliefs."" Those who viewed ethics as abiding by a professional code had more confidence in the mechanisms addressed in this study to aid the public accounting profession's ability to ensure high ethical standards of conduct. Methodological implications of this distinction for future studies in business ethics are discussed. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Rather it is suggested that the meaning of participation at work will vary with the context both in terms of the objective form of the labour process, e.g. manual, non-manual, etc., and it will also depend upon the meta-contexts of wider social structures. A parallel is drawn between the forms of rationality implied in the practice of employee participation and that of management accounting where in both cases the ""neutrality"" of the practice is invalidated once placed with in the real terrain of social relationships at work and within wider society. © 1991.",,

In contrast to previous occupational stress research, which has tended to concentrate on the perspective of staff without interpreting either the interrelationships between the experiences of caregiver and recipients or the ways in which the social context of care influences all participants' interpretations of their situation, this paper will argue that the occupational stresses facing psychiatric professionals cannot be fully understood without a clear understanding of the ambivalent role of welfare institutions within our society. This necessitates moving beyond the decontextualized, micro-level analyses advocated within the traditional occupational stress literature and drawing on alternative theoretical traditions which facilitate richer interpretations of the complex interplay between the structure and ideology of Western psychiatric systems and the motives, understandings, actions and emotions of different players within the system. With these considerations in mind, this article seeks to forge new links between the theoretical analysis of psychiatry's role within our society and the empirical investigation of occupational stress in psychiatric nursing by elucidating the interpersonal processes which enable the structural contradictions of psychiatry to find concrete expression within the fragmented understanding and inconsistent actions of the various players within the system. As the empirical research will reveal, staff attempts to ameliorate the chronic personal insecurities engendered by these contradictions often have the paradoxical effect of augmenting the problems of the psychiatric system and intensifying the very feelings they are struggling to avoid. © 1991.","contradiction; occupational stress; psychiatry; social relationships","article; human; human relation; normal human; occupational exposure; psychiatry; social interaction; stress; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Nurses; Occupational Diseases; Psychiatry; Social Environment"

In 1985 and in 1986, the association of Catholic businessmen produced two documents on the ethical implications of economic activity. But in those years, the world of big business, had not yet realised how central the argument was becoming. The first significant signs of interest for business ethics appeared in 1987. In June, 1988, the first Italian National Conference on Business Ethics took place in Milan. The main outcome of that conference has been the constitution of the Italian Chapter of the European Network. In 1988, I founded the first issue of the journal entitled ""Etica degli-Affari"". Promotional efforts have developped along two lines. The first regards programs of executive training and, eventually, consulting. In the second place, efforts are being made to elaborate and introduce codes of ethics in Italian corporations. There are, however, some very fundamental difficulties involved in the promotion of Business Ethics in Italy. The first problem is the fact that Italy is a country with a ""low ethical temperature"". We don't have a strong sense of national identity, nor do we have a strong sense of the state. The second difficulty has to do with the business environment - the Italian business community itself. As a self-conscious, self-aware nucleus of a sector of society, the Italian business community is a very recent, and rather minoritarian social phenomenon. I personally feel that a certain protagonism on the part of prominent business leaders who are quite sensitive to the theme of ethics would prove to be very influential and greatly accelerate the process. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

The corruption type addressed to in this article is the collusion between public officials and private managers for illegal or undue profits. Corruption in this form is related to the long-standing policy of State intervention and overregulation of the economy in order to industrialize the country. The issue analyzed is the perception of corruption as a major political and social problem. Corruption is pervasive in many societies but it is not perceived as a central problem. The explanation for this perception in Venezuela is the increased impoverishment of people as a consequence of present economic crisis (the corrupt person is perceived as taking from my pocket) and the openness and pluralistic character of the political system. Moral indignation and scandal is the result of this new feature of Venezuelan society. Changes in the economic policies and the awareness of corruption seem to establish the basis to overcome the perception of corruption as the paramount problem it is now. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

This paper is a response to Bowie, but more importantly, it is designed to articulate the force and substance of the pragmatist philosophy developed by Richard Rorty. In his article, Bowie suggested that ""moral universalism' (which he endorses) is the only credible method of doing business ethics across cultures and that ""cultural relativism' and 'ethnocentrism' are not. Bowie, in a manner surprisingly common among contemporary philosophers, lumps Rorty into a 'bad guy' category without careful analysis of his philosophy and ascribes to him views which clearly do not fit. I attempt to provide both a more careful articulation of Rorty's views, and to use his pragmatism to illustrate an approach to business ethics which is more fruitful than Bowie's. This brand of philosophy follows the Enlightenment spirit of toleration and attempts to set aside questions of 'Truth,' whether religious or philosophical, and have ethics centered around what James called 'that which is good in the way of belief.' Rather than looking for 'metaphysical foundations' or some type of external justification, ethicists perform their craft from within the cultural traditions, narratives and practices of their society. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Debate continues about whether ethics should be a part of business, but also includes how business can implement ethical theory in day-to-day operations. Most discussions focus on either traditional moral philosophy, which offers little of practical value for the business community, or psychological theories of moral reasoning, which have been shown to be flawed and incomplete. The theory presented here is called the Developmental Self-Valuing Theory, and adapts the general psychological theory of Albert Bandura for ethics in business. In this theory, individuals first learn moral values from associations with others who are significant in their lives. Secondly, self-regulation is learned through a process of self-observation, self-judgment and self-reaction. Thirdly, the individual must believe that he can act ethically. Situational constraints and inducements, as well as positive and negative consequences for specific behaviors, will also affect the level of ethical performance. Each of these elements is examined and combined to achieve a practical method for increasing the level of ethics in corporate activity through selection, training and situational enhancement. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Age was significantly associated with marital status, social network index quartile, and the social relationship to the primary source of support. Women and men differed with respect to current marital status, number of close friends and relatives, frequency of face-to-face contact, and participation in voluntary associations and religious institutions. Regardless of their marital status, women were also less likely than men to point to a spouse as their primary source of support. Beck Depression Inventory mean scores and rates of depressive symptoms were inversely associated with social network index and participation in voluntary associations and religious institutions for both men and women. Individuals with no primary source of support or who depended on a relative had significantly higher than expected mean scores and rates of depressive symptoms. Both social network index and social distance to primary source of support were independently associated with depression after controlling for age, sex, and number of chronic conditions. Participation in voluntary associations, social distance from primary source of support, church membership, and number of close friends were also significant independent predictors of depressive symptoms. Results indicate that depressive symptoms are inversely associated with the size of social networks. The structure of these networks, in turn, is influenced by biological factors such as age, physical disability, and mortality of network members, and by culturally-determined rules that define the individuals and institutions available for support. However, these rules appear to differ for men and women. © 1990.","depression; elderly; sex; social networks","aged; article; depression; female; human; male; methodology; organization and management; psychological aspect; social care; social interaction; social structure; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; California; Cultural Characteristics; Depressive Disorder; Female; Human; Male; Marriage; Prevalence; Social Environment; Social Isolation; Social Support; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

On each vessel fishermen's remuneration is a share of the value of the catch. The results show that harvest shares of myopic fishermen will be reduced when cartels are established. Intertemporal optimization of the resource use by the cartel is accompanied by the problem of the cartel's viability. Share contracts are traditionally motivated by risk sharing and by the avoidance of labor monitoring. The results of this paper suggest new important reasons for the commonness of share contracts in fishing. Sharefishing is a self-adaptive and time-consistent remuneration system as it automatically accomodates differences in individual crews' labor supplies due to differences in fishermen's skills and cost factors. An essential result found that supports harvest sharing is the relative simplicity of the social management policy; optimal regulation is accomplished by a constant subsidy on the price of fish. The subsidy policy is time consistent and does not change as the stock level changes. The paper also addresses conditions under which stock extinction does not occur in sharefishing. © 1990.",,

This quandary is the assumption that ethical agents' hands are clean in certain situations even if they have done something they condemn as immoral. Since limited paternalism can give rise to this queer conclusion in the salesperson/buyer relationship, the principle is suspect.

While the actions of top management may be the single most important factor in fostering corporate behaviour of a high ethical standard, there should be policy where policy is needed. The perceptions of three managerial groups - top- marketing- and purchasing managers - are compared regarding firstly, whether they see a need for policy on a range of ethically contentious issues, and secondly whether they believe there is policy covering these issues in their own organizations. No significant differences between the three groups of managers were found, either with regard to their perceptions of needs for policy, or as far as the existence thereof is concerned. However, an overall comparison of need for policy and the existence of policy showed a significant difference on the scenarios presented to respondents. Furthermore, the study identifies grey areas of ethics in business where managers believe policy is needed, but is not perceived to exist. The use of an ethics policy matrix in organizations is suggested as a practcial tool for the examination of ethically contentious issues. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Whereas the latter refers to systematic reflection on the moral significance of the institutions, policies and behavior of business actors in the normal course of their business operations, the former is a subset of the broader notion of Corporate Social Responsibility and denotes, generally, discretionary, possibly altruistic, ""non-business"" relationships between business organizations and diverse community stakeholders. A newer concept, the Corporate Social Policy Process, which focuses on the institutionalization within business organizations of processes facilitating individual and organizational reflection and choice regarding the moral significance of personal and organizational action together with a consideration of the likely consequences of such action, provides analytical linkages between Business Ethics and Corporate Good Citizenship which can be useful to business scholars and operating managers alike.

The research indicates that lawyers inevitably provide a degree of control through their technical expertise, but that they also identify strongly with their companies and emphasise shared ethics rather than ethical differences between lawyers and their employers. This can partly be explained by their integration with the company but also rests on the problematic nature of law and regulatory controls in relation to organisations within the community. In-house lawyers therefore reject a 'policing' role in favour of a 'counselling' role. Since they perceive themselves as part of a shared culture of ethics, they also avoid a leadership role. However, the article suggests that the nature of legal judgment should assist lawyers towards such a role, while recognising that organisational 'statesmanship' must be constrained by organisational culture and the wider community culture of ethical standards. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

First, an analysis is undertaken of the implicit assumptions, values and goals that derive from the conception of human problems in work organizations as ""managing human resources"". Secondly, it is argued that such a conception is in fact a socially constructed reality with ""real"" consequences and not a reflection of ""objective"" states of human and social nature with which we have to live.

Our analysis resulted in a typology, presented here, of the ways in which normative theory, and the difficulties within it, are handled in business ethics texts.

De George, that while clarification of concepts, implications, and presuppositions in business ethics largely relies on a 'neutral territory' of reason, determination of what moral intuitions are correct depends on 'non-neutral' ethical theories. The latter posit ethics in business to varying degrees. Thus while the Kantian and utilitarian ethical theories are, for De George, proper (philosophical) approaches to business ethics, they are as reliant on affirming and encouraging moral sentiments outside parameters of 'pure reason' as theological approaches. And hence if theological approaches can make no unique contribution by virtue of relying on more than reason or experience alone, then philosophical approaches can make no distinctive contribution either. Either both are viable or neither are. Oscillation between the mutually dependent notions of business ethics and ethics in business obfuscates what the field of business ethics is and renders De George's position inadequate. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Proponents of testing have had to tackle difficult questions concerning the nature, extent, and weight of the privacy rights of employees. This paper examines a different kind of argument - the claim that because corporations are ""responsible"" for harms committed by employees while under the influence of drugs, they are entitled to test for drug use. This argument has considerable intuitive appeal, because it seems, at least at first glance, to bypass the issue of privacy rights altogether. The argument turns, not on rights, but on the nature and conditions of responsibility. We may therefore call it an ""ought implies can"" argument. In spite of its initial appeal, however, the argument does not succeed in circumventing the claims of privacy rights. Even responsibility for the actions of others does not entitle us to do anything at all to control their behavior; we must look to rights, among other things, to determine what sorts of controls are morally permissible. In addition, the argument rests on unjustified assumptions about the connection between drug testing and the prevention of drug-related harm. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

We observe that they pay a great deal of attention to the victim of pena and that they try to improve relationships with the social network and the family.

Healthy development depends on both a propitious environment and the action of adolescents themselves. A stable family, peace, material conditions for physical health, and educational, social and vocational opportunities with a chance to make use of them before marriage, are necessary environment conditions. However, within this context the adolescent must experiment with new behaviours and relationships inevitably courting some risks. Adolescent health is especially linked to behaviour. If the environment is inadequate or dangerous and the adolescent lacks self-esteem, behaviours dangerous to health are more likely to occur. These include: precocious and unprotected sexual behaviour sometimes resulting in too early or unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases; the use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs; injuries arising accidentally from risk taking behaviours especially when combined with alcohol or drugs; intentional injury whether self-inflicted or inflicted by others; and poor eating and habits of hygiene leading to obesity, or emaciation, acne and poor teeth and gums. Adolescent behaviour is often governed by their beliefs about what others think. Two way communication in a trusting atmosphere will reduce myths and misinformation and encourage healthy behaviour. The promotion of health, the prevention of problems, and their treatment and rehabilitation when they arise can best be accomplished with the active co-operation of young people. © 1989.","adolescents; behaviour; communications; health","adolescent; health behavior; human; juvenile; normal human; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Communication; Cultural Characteristics; Female; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Human; Male; Sex Behavior; Substance-Related Disorders"

Noting that while there appears to be genuine concern with the most recent outbreak of ethical failings as well as widespread support for the concept of morally and ethically educated current and future managers, there is less agreement on the most efficient and effective means of realizing this goal. For perspective purposes, recent research findings and opinions of leaders in higher education and business on the issue of ethics and the curriculum are highlighted. This paper challenges business, government, and higher education to disengage the ""cheap"" talk and to engage in a collaborative effort to develop a required, team-taught, interdisciplinary business ethics course based on philosophical inquiry, organizational theory, and actual business situations. Course goals, content, leadership, and benefits to students, managers, and ethicists are identified and discussed. Perhaps the failure of America's higher education institutions in preparing ethically responsible future leaders of business and government reflects the inability to ""teach"" ethics under any format. Could the problem be, however, that the approaches, to date, have not sufficiently incorporated the talents and experiences of line managers in conjunction with the theoretical frameworks of moral philosophers? This relatively simple conceptual approach, though admittedly difficult to successfully implement, is offered as a means of closing the business ethics rhetoricreality gap. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Particularly controversial has been the university's emerging role of applied researcher in addition to its traditional role of basic researcher. Private, for-profit research laboratories have vociferously objected to the funding of university applied research by both the federal government and private industry. The funding of university research by these latter two entities is then reviewed and discussed. In addition to the ethical issue of whether university applied research should be funded, there is apparently another ethical issue regarding how the recipient universities are selected. In essence, if the universities intrusions are merely into untended areas, the first ethical issue seems less serious. Such may be the case if private laboratories are not equipped to perform the research. Of course, the second issue of which university should receive the funding remains. The apparently strengthening ties between universities and private industry are then reviewed. Direct ties between universities and industry still account for a very small part of university research. But impediments to cooperation are melting away as universities market their services to private industry. The authors contend that the government encourages cooperative ventures between universities and industry. They pose questions for all sides and suggest further areas of study should these joint ventures continue as they seem most likely to do. Much of the literature has leaned toward criticism of these joint efforts. Martin Kenney, in the February, 1987 issue of The Journal of Business Ethics, offered one of the more extensive efforts in his criticism of cooperative industrial/university research. Kenney concentrated on the area of biotechnology research. The present article avoids specific areas of research and takes a broad view of these cooperative research efforts. It is less critical than Kenney of the cooperation between industry and universities. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Accordingly, it seems appropriate to evaluate the text materials used from the perspective of the business student. Relative to early criticisms, recent texts represent considerable improvements in their use of case materials and in the manner by which they involve the student in decision-making situations. However, there are two distortions present in all of the texts examined. First, they concentrate too heavily on cases of a policy, or general management, nature. The result is an inadequate coverage of the functional areas of the firm in which graduates begin their employment. Second, they concentrate too heavily on manufacturing firms, and thus do not introduce students to the ethical problems found where they are most likely to work, in service firms. It is to be hoped that these imbalances can be easily corrected, thus providing students with a more realistic picture of where in the firm, and in which types of firms, ethical issues are likely to arise. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Is economic theory an ethically neutral discipline or do its statements presuppose a commitment to moral values? Once again this issue is addressed via a case study of the neo-classical theory of rational choice. In the present paper I focus on behaviourist forms of ""operationalist"" attempts to short-circuit any argument that would seek to infer moral presuppositions from the use of evaluative discourse. In particular, I examine strategies that have sought to excise from economic theory the ""mentalistic"" vocabulary required to describe valuations per se. And I argue that such tactics are deficient since they i) impoverish the explanatory power of economic theory, (ii) fail to recover the normative usefulness of the theory of choice, and (iii) camouflage the continued presupposition of moral commitments within neo-classical theory. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Applications for the course are numerous, so selection can be very rigorous. Thus the students admitted to the course comprise many of the country's most promising junior managers. As an assignment for a course on business ethics, the students were asked to discuss an ethical problem they had met in the course of business. An analysis of the problems discussed is quite revealing. Besides several miscellaneous issues, the problems discussed focussed on sexual harrassment, nepotism, political pressure and particularly public corruption. The emphasis on public corruption is probably explicable in terms of the particular individuals admitted to the MBA course; it should not be explained by claiming that ""Zimbabwe is just one more corrupt third world country"". Most surprising is the total absence of any problems relating to issues of race or to trading with South Africa, which might have been considered the major ethical issues in Zimbabwe business life. The lack of problems relating to these two issues is more difficult to explain. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Different values will steer IM practitioners in different policy directions. If IM is to be more than a ""social gadget,"" designed to promote the firm's narrow economic objectives, it must be self-consciously grounded in ethics.

They cannot do otherwise, and thus either have no obligations at all or only the duty to maximize profit. The thesis of the Managerial Revolution, if true, establishes only that management is free from direct stockholder control. By asserting that corporations have responsibilities to do other than maximize profit, philosophers assume a wide degree of managerial discretion, without considering recent developments in the theory of the firm which suggest that new incentives and constraints radically restrict managerial liberty in a capitalist society. © 1988 D.

Nchimi means 'witch-diviner' and Mutumwa means 'sent (by God)'. Their witch-divining practices are thus placed within the new biblical religious framework. Mutumwa Nchimi healers are contemporary African psychiatrists and psychotherapists who fully accept and work within the framework of the wizardry paradigm as the explanatory mechanism for a whole range of problems and illnesses experienced by a large number of Zambia's urban dwellers. Their success in attracting patients bears witness to the extent to which wizardry still persists as a paradigm for evil. The research data used is comprised of 143 complete tape-recorded cases of Mutumwa Nchimi diagnoses in addition to 1233 summaries of book-recorded cases. Buloshi is mentioned as the cause of illness and misfortune in 58% of the tape-recorded cases and in 55.9% of the book-recorded cases. Wizardry is perceived by Mutumwa Nchimi healers to relate to two dimensions which refer to the activity of witchcraft and of sorcery respectively. The former relates to witch spirits and fibanda ghosts; the latter relates to the use of bwanga magical charms. In addition to the need for prayer and reconciliation, psychotherapy requires the cleansing of one's body and of one's house from buloshi attack. The two dimensions of witchcraft and of sorcery, though distinct, are seen to be essentially related to one another. The dreams of patients, in which unconscious pressures come to the surface, are perceived to confirm the existence and reality of wizardry assault. Wizardry beliefs are placed firmly within the context of social relationships and social change in Zambia and psychosocial analysis is at the centre of the diagnostic process. Wizardry beliefs are seen by Mutumwa Nchimi healers to reflect the problems faced by urban dwellers in particular who, on the one hand, find themselves afflicted by feelings of shame or guilt with respect to failure to observe traditional morality and, on the other hand, by an awareness of suspected rival forces in the competitive urban environment. © 1988.","healing; sorcery; witchcraft; Zambia","article; child; cultural anthropology; diagnosis; dream; family; female; female infertility; human; human relation; male; marriage; religion; sociology; traditional medicine; urban population; Zambia; Child; Diagnosis; Dreams; Family; Female; Human; Infertility, Female; Interpersonal Relations; Magic; Male; Marriage; Medicine, Traditional; Religion and Medicine; Social Change; Urban Population; Zambia"

'Profit' often includes the moral or value consideration of having been rightly or fairly earned. This provides one starting point internal to business for formulating standards for business ethics. © 1987 D. Reidel Publishing Company.",,

This essay first examines two arguments that might be in people's minds in making such a claim - that business is a ""game,"" and hence the ordinary constraints of morality do not apply, and that one cannot survive in business if one is too ""ethical."" The critique of these arguments begins the process of making clear what business ethics is. The paper then proceeds in a more positive vein to define and explain for the sceptic what business ethics is. Everyone must confront the question, what should I do in my business relationships? Business ethics is defined, then, as the effort to develop Socratically one's answer to this question, that is, through the critical examination of alternatives. In the process of explaining this notion, several other senses in which someone might say that there is no such thing as business ethics are explored and the basic distinction between the moral point of view and ethical egoism is introduced. © 1987 D.

Briefly, associative advertising induces people to buy (or buy more of) a product by associating that market product with such deep-seated non-market goods as friendship, acceptance and esteem from others, excitement and power even though the market good seldom satisfies or has any connection with the non-market desire. The fault in associative advertising is not that it is deceptive or that it violates the autonomy of its audience - on this point I find Robert Arrington's arguments persuasive ('Advertising and Behavior Control', Journal of Business Ethics 1 (1982), 3-12). Instead, I will argue against associative advertising by examining the virtues and vices at stake. In so doing, I will offer an alternative to Arrington's exclusive concern with autonomy and behavior control. My main criticism is two-fold: (a) Advertisers must surely desensitize themselves to the compassion, concern, and sympathy for others that are central emotions in a virtuous person, and (b) associative advertising influences its audience to neglect the nonmarket cultivation of our virtues and to substitute market goods instead, with the result that we become worse and, quite likely, less happy persons. © 1987 D.

We are concerned with deafness because in an earlier study mothers of deaf children reported that they had consulted these practitioners. All of the healers distinguished congenital and non-congenital deafness, and in their efforts to cure patients they were guided by experience and specialist knowledge. A higher proportion of the herbalists associated congenital deafness with natural causes than did the other type of healers. The babalawos and indigenous faith healers who mentioned a natural cause of congenital deafness believed that the primary causative agents were supernatural. Half of the indigenous faith healers and more than half of the babalawos we interviewed attributed non-congenital deafness to malevolent forces, while only 12.5% of the herbalists made this attribution. Treatment procedures and preventive techniques were based on conceptions of causality. While the majority of the herbalists prescribed a herbal ear drop, a majority of the babalawos and the indigenous faith healers prescribed sacrifices to appease the aggrieved parties. Some interesting points that emanated from the study include the healers' explanation that a person's essence is transmitted to his personal effects, which are used with incantation to inflict the deaf person. Closely associated with this is the healers' warning that patients need to maintain good-neighbourliness to avoid further harm. The paper further highlights the adherence to pregnancy taboos to avoid congenital deafness. © 1987.","beliefs; deafness; social control; social relationships; Yoruba healers","auditory system; diagnosis; hearing impairment; human; major clinical study; Adult; Comparative Study; Deafness; Ethnic Groups; Female; Human; Infant; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Age; Nigeria; Phytotherapy; Pregnancy; Superstitions; Taboo"

Related to the practical, religion applies theological concepts to business situations; namely, vocation, stewardship, human dignity, co-creation, co-conservation, sharing in God's power, servant leadership, encounter with the Incarnation, sacramental sign and justice (divine and human). These concepts suggest the threefold component of religion: doctrine (creed), worship (cult) and values governing behavior (code). A principle taken from religious practice illustrates its unique contribution to business ethics. The principle of proportionality (or double effect) exemplifies code in its balancing of good and evil outcomes. The more contemporary principle called the fundamental option identifies the role of vocation and calling in the notion of creed. The component cult might be reflected in the insistence on human dignity which is highlighted in papal social teaching. © 1986 D. Reidel Publishing Company.",,

I argue that this ignores our relations with the non-autonomous and is parasitic on a wider and more generous notion of the political and moral community. I suggest that such a community must form a focus of its members' loyalties and an end (telos) for human virtues. I then draw some lessons for business ethics, arguing that it is an essentially specialized enterprise which ought not to used to model moral and political relations in general. © 1986 D.

Tuberculosis is one of the best medical pointers to social inequality. The disease is seen here as typical of the links between industrialization and health, with regard to the evolution of the epidemiological model and the influence of innovatory treatments, based on chemotherapy, on the organization of care for tubercular patients, together with the socio-economic and cultural changes that have affected both French and Algerian society during the twentieth century. The first part of the article shows how the epidemiology of tuberculosis tends to vary in accordance with the dynamic evolution of social relationships as industrialization occurs in each country, and how world-wide epidemiological trends are one of the best medical pointers to the North-South divide. The second part of the article is given over to a study of the way in which the application of tuberculosis treatments in both France and Algeria is a function of the organization of the health system in each country, of the status and power of the medical profession within society, and of the impact of technical innovations on the changing forms of care for tubercular patients in both countries. In France, it can be seen that the structure of the system set up to combat tuberculosis in the inter-war years has tended to remain unchanged, despite the opportunities for re-organization of tuberculosis treatment and for making therapy less onerous which have arisen as the incidence of the disease has dropped and antibiotics have been introduced. This resistance to change seems due primarily to the difficulty of achieving redeployment of medical staff, and the inertia caused by the rigid structure of tuberculosis care within the French socio-medical system. On the other hand, in Algeria, a country where the health service is still in the process of taking shape, acceptance by society of the most recent progress in the fight against tuberculosis by the social space left open for an organization of treatments based on a real desire to match the responses of medical institutions to the needs of patients, though one wonders how long this state of affairs will last. Comparison of the situation in the two countries highlights the power relationships that control health policy decision-making and the organization of health care in two differing societies, which are nonetheless linked to each other by 130 years of French colonial presence in Algeria and the historical influence of the French medical pattern on the social organization of medicine in that country. © 1985.",,"tuberculostatic agent; adolescent; adult; Algeria; article; child; comparative study; cultural anthropology; France; health care delivery; housing; human; industry; public health; socioeconomics; tuberculosis; algeria; chemotherapy; decision; france; geographic distribution; health care; health care policy; history; industrialization; medical technology; nervous system; organization and management; short survey; social aspect; therapy; tuberculosis; tuberculosis control; Adolescent; Adult; Algeria; Antitubercular Agents; Child; Comparative Study; Culture; English Abstract; France; Health Services Accessibility; Housing; Human; Industry; National Health Programs; Socioeconomic Factors; Tuberculosis; Algeria; epidemiology of tuberculosis; France"

Professionalsim thus lifts the requirements of law to the level of personal commitment. Like an 'honest act', professionalism may not be easy to define, but you will know it when you see it. As for professionalism's practitioners, like the practitioners of honesty, their art is learned not by seeking definitions of what they do, but by practicing professionalism.

The central question which must be answered in discussions of corporate moral responsibility is whether corporations are moral agents or moral persons. I argue that, though we can make a case for saying corporations are moral agents, they are not moral persons, and hence, we can hold them responsible.

Its purpose is to give practical moral guidance to executives for the conduct of their lives both as corporate decision-makers and as human beings. The pivotal concept in this model of personal business ethics is a direct appeal to the self-interest of executives in their being moral. Our thesis is that generally there is a twofold return on investment in ethics (ROIE) for executives. The first one is related to employee output: by becoming a self-actualizing moral type, executives indicate commitment to excellence. Accordingly, they so manage employees that the latter can also live up to their full potential and excell. And that would increase corporate productivity and product or service quality. The second payback of morality is personal: fully developed, self-actualized managers are generally happier people than those whose growth has been arrested. In brief, moral self-actualization is the same as commitment to excellence and there is a payback in being the best. Return on investment in ethics and return on investment in excellence can both be abbreviated as ROIE. We accomplish the purpose and establish the thesis of this essay by seeking answers to the following questions: What business does ethics have in business? What business does business have in ethics? Is there a return on investment in ethics for executives? and Does being moral help executives become more effective managers? In sketching answers to these questions, we first show why executives need a personal business ethics especially in today's world. Then, we sketch the nature of ethics and of business. After these introductory materials, the body of the paper argues for a personal business ethics for executives by correlating elements of management theory with ethics. Specifically, it links a theory of employee motivation with a scale of values, management character types with moral types, and management leadership styles with morality. Then, the practical technique of life by objectives (LBO) is explained. It can help executives manage their lives more effectively in both the business and ethical sense. We conclude by explaining ideals of excellence which can guide executives in their work and development both as managers and as human beings. © 1984 D. Reidel Publishing Company.",,

This paper reviews such evidence and concludes that explanations of 'coronary-prone behaviour' should acknowledge that it is embedded in particular uses of the body and in particular forms of social relationship. Based upon this premise, a conceptual analysis is presented to demonstrate that 'coronary proneness' is insufficiently described as a behaviour pattern, but is more usefully considered as a mode of action constituting a contradiction in the person's social relationships.

Thus physicians' evaluations of work-related impairment are the primary basis for administrative disability determinations. Increasing litigation regarding disability determinations and experience with long-term work-related disability suggest that the guiding policies are flawed. Work-related disability is as much a problem of manpower policy as it is one of personal health, but most employers and compensation programs in the United States do not yet respond to it as such. Recommended is a shift from a medical to a socioeconomic frame of reference for work-related disability that would overtly recognize regional variations in the static and dynamic factors of the economy and that would promote return to work and rehabilitation.

This behavior is associated, in essence, with self-segregation and social isolation accompanied by spatial expansion. This study deals with these processes in one of the largest concentrations of the ultra-orthodox Jewish community-the northern neighborhoods of Jerusalem. The Jewish ultra-orthodox community is characterized by its special interpretation of Jewish law (halacha) and by its high degree of cohesiveness. It tends to segregate itself from the Israeli population for two main motives. The positive one is the desire to create and maintain ""cultural dominance"" in a specific area in which the community lives and functions. This includes considerations of scale economies and concentration economies in the provision of the special goods and services which it consumes. The second motive, a negative one, is the desire to avoid some kinds of contacts and interactions with the various groups which do not observe Jewish law according to the orthodox conception. This is done in order to prevent the transfer of secular cultural values of western society into their domain. The high communal cohesiveness, coupled with high population growth and a strong desire for self-territorial segregation, results in increased pressure on the urban residential space. The fear of social relationship-which may serve as agents for transferring social or cultural values-results in a high degree of intolerance toward the non-religious Israeli population. The contact lines between the two populations have become, therefore, confrontation areas which are characterized by territorial conflicts. Study of the directions of the territorial expansion suggests what the spatial strategy of the ultraorthodox community is: to gain control of a whole, well-defined urban space in order to maintain cultural dominance in it, while assuring potential directions for expansion in the future. The relationships with the outside, non-religious population is built on a modus operandi principle: i.e. minimal and culturally neutral interactions. This strategy is carried out through penetration and expansion tactics in a well-known process. These processes present important challenges for planning areas in which ultra-orthodox communities reside. © 1985.",,

Any system of distribution or marketing that permits businessmen and women to maximise profits in the sale or distribution of basic goods that are in short supply is bound to aggravate the situation for an already starving people such as are to be found in Africa. The adoption of wholesale capitalism in conditions of acute shortage of basic (as well as non-basic) goods, is unconducive to the invention or practice of or belief in Akan-like or Christian-like ethics. Hence, central planning with respect to the necessities of life seems to me to be necessary in many parts of the Third World; and the African attempt to revolutionalize business ethics merely by means of coup d'etats, is likely to be counter-productive. © 1983 D.

That is, others' violations of moral rules may make it permissible for one to also violate these rules, to avoid being unfairly disadvantaged. This claim, originally advanced by Hobbes, is applied to three cases in business. It is suggested that the claim is one source of scepticism concerning business ethics. I argue, however, that the conditions under which business competitors' violations of moral rules would render one's own violations permissible are quite restricted. Hence, the observation that two wrongs may make a right does not give people a broad warrant for ignoring moral standards in their business activities. © 1984 Random House, Inc.",,

In Section I, I maintain that a Marxist would supplement traditional explanations of the increased interest in business ethics by an emphasis on class needs created by a situation of declining profits. I argue, in Section II, that business ethics might be used to address two needs created by this situation: (1) to legitimate the system of capitalist production: and (2) to discipline individual members of the bourgeoisie so that they will refrain from pursuing their individual interests when these conflict with the interests of their class. In Section III, I argue that there is no guarantee that business ethics will develop to meet these class needs, and that the questions to which an interest in business ethics gives rise may themselves lead to serious and effective criticism of business. © 1982 D.

The ground for this analogy lies in the nature of activity itself which is common to both and to find a ground therein an analysis of the features of activity is presented based upon a comparison of 'activity' and 'process' by Alburey Castell. Activity is said to be bi-polar with one pole the purpose or goal to be handled in utilitarean fashion and the other pole concerned with the maintenance of the presuppositions of activity. While any goal chosen will have hypothetical 'oughts' as its conditions, it is argued that the presuppositions of activity are categorical 'oughts' in that they cannot be denied without asserting them. And since one of these presuppositions is freedom of choice, thus giving activity the power to destroy its own possibility, these presuppositions function in the context of practice as categorical norms and are universal in their applicability as preserving the possibility of responsible activity for everyone else as well as myself. All activity whether it be other-regarding or self-regarding (self-interest in the business world) is subject to the norms of its own possibility, its enabling conditions, and this constitutes the moral ground for personal, managerial and a basis for inquiry into corporate responsibility. All of these ideas are put forth within the wider context of the problem of corporate legitimacy and constitute a prolegomena to it. © 1979 Bentley College.",,

From the union perspective, fair wages and working conditions are synonymous with the quality of working life, and unions pursue these through collective bargaining, which is essentially adversarial in both the public and private sectors.

Most investigations of abortion have focused on the attitudes of individual abortion patients as a means of explaining the growing number of pregnancy terminations in New York and throughout the United States. This study seeks to place this earlier research in ecological perspective by examining the social conditions in Manhattan associated with its spatial concentration of induced abortions. Data from the City Health Department and the U.S. Census were combined to describe abortion rates and status of women among New York's 339 health areas. A factor analysis of this data base using a varimax solution revealed that the most prominent areas of abortion usage cluster among populations of well-educated, professionally employed women living in communities on Manhattan's East Side and Greenwich Village. Single marital status and high population turnover were also found to covary with abortion. Results of this analysis suggest that the attitudes found among abortion patients in previous studies may be fostered by the compendium of pressures from single parenthood, upward mobility and short-term social relationships. © 1981.",,"abortion; economic aspect; geographic distribution; law; legal aspect; short survey; socioeconomics; united states"

However, non-neoclassical theory stresses the importance of social relationships in the spheres of production, and distribution and exchange. Capital itself is an all-pervading concept rather than being just a category, as in neoclassical theory. The economy is viewed as a reproducing and expanding, production system in which accumulation and profits are ends in themselves.

First the relevant characteristics of neighbourly interactions are examined, and the distinction drawn between studies at individual and aggregate levels respectively. The concern subsequently is primarily with the measurement problems at the aggregate or group level, and a technique for analysing patterns of social relations is described called the standard deviational ellipse. Drawing upon research which has recently been carried out in selected neighbourhoods of the City of Cardiff, the paper discusses the utility of this method for analysing the eommunality in patterns of neighbourly interaction as a basis for generalisation, and argues the case for further social-geographical research in this field. © 1979.",,

This paper examines this theoretical problem through observations of doctor-patient encounters. A review of recent theoretical advances leads to the proposition that face-to-face interaction between health professionals and clients helps maintain broad patterns of ideology and social control. A theory is proposed that links professional-client interaction with ideology and consciousness, social institutions, social relationships of daily life, and the material conditions and class relationships of the workplace and economic system. Quantitative data from an empirical study of doctor-patient interaction are analyzed with reference to this theory. Qualitative analysis from the same study reveals themes of ideologic reproduction and social control concerning relations of production, class relations, the role of science under capitalism, and medical control of everyday life. Counterhegemonic strategy suggested by this work includes challenging the assumed objectivity of medical science, clarifying the partly political nature of messages that clients receive from professionals, and working against domination based on expert knowledge. © 1979.",,"doctor patient relation; interpersonal communication; normal human; patient information; psychological aspect; short survey; social interaction; therapy; Medicine; Physician-Patient Relations; Political Systems; Politics; Social Control, Informal; Social Dominance; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

It has influenced their concepts and practices of illness and healing. Increasing use is made both of modern medical facilities and of traditional medicinemen's/women's services. Individualized treatment is replacing communal forms of healing more frequently. The healers, waganga, in rural areas diagnose still more often various categories of spirits as the causers of illnesses and consequently prescribe communal forms of healing, whilst their city counterparts look for causes in terms of horizontal social relationships and resort to individualized treatment. By doing this they accord to changes in people's life-patterns, but also on their part contribute to increased sense of mistrust, making lucrative business on their clients' expense. As the communal healing practices decrease new forms of community building will be required to replace the former communal rituals. It is suggested that in organizing modern health services use should be made of political and productive social units, such as 10 house cells in Tanzania. in order to make health care more effective and to strengthen community cooperation. At present the methods of diagnosis and the organization of health practices reflect the trend toward social fragmentation, but they could be used in directing a community toward greater integration if the central role that healing has in a changing socio-economic situation was recognized and the changing concepts of illness and patterns of healing could be properly analyzed. © 1979.",,"community care; ethnic group; ethnic or racial aspects; geographic distribution; short survey; tanzania; therapy; traditional medicine; Adult; Child; Community Medicine; Comparative Study; Culture; Female; Holistic Health; Human; Individuality; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Mental Healing; Rural Population; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Tanzania; Urban Population"

In defining the themes of general practice, prominent U.K. practitioners have pointed to a social orientation which distinguishes general practice from other areas of medicine. This loosely defined social orientation appears to include several themes. On the one hand there is an awareness of social relationships, social factors in disease and illness behaviour, and of the social causes of disease, and on the other, a feeling for a responsibility for caring for the social consequences of diseases, for social welfare problems, and for socio- or psychotherapeutic care. An involvement in social care raises certain questions about the role of the general practitioner which have not been explored by those doctors who have discussed this social orientation. At one level there are practical problems of the conflict between the provision of medical and social care and the relationship with other care workers, but at a more basic level there is a fundamental question concerning our socio-political approach to social problems. © 1977.",,"general practitioner; geographic distribution; psychological aspect; short survey; social work; therapy; united kingdom; Family Practice; Great Britain; Human; Interprofessional Relations; Patient Care Team; Physician's Role; Role; Social Problems; Sociology, Medical"
