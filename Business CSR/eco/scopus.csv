This can be seen in the wording of ""corporate responsibility"" as well as most of the research regarding social responsibility. Although small businesses make up fifty-one per cent of gross domestic product, and account for approximately fifty percent of United States employment, research on them is minimal compared to large firms. The literature is dominated by large multinational organizations. More research needs to be focused on the small business enterprise. This article provides the results of a study of social responsibility in a select group of small businesses. Chief Executive Officer owners of privately owned manufacturing companies participated in the study. Approximately half of the firms representing four regions in the United States publicly proclaimed a commitment to social responsibility. The other half were selected with no knowledge of their orientation to social responsibility. The results provide meaningful insights into the nature of social responsibility in small business.",,

Findings show that companies issued more product-related initiatives than promotion-related ones. Among these, less than half generated a substantial number of responses from bloggers, which could not be identified as a specific group. While new product introductions led to positive buzz, modifications of current products resulted in more negative responses, even if there was a high fit with core business. While promotion-related press releases were received negatively in general, particularly periphery promotion (compared to core promotion) generated most reactions. Our exploratory study suggests that companies can increase the likelihood of a positive reaction if they carefully consider the fit between initiatives and their core business, while taking the notion of 'controversial fit', relating to the unhealthy nature of original products, into account.

This deficit is redressed in the present paper through utilizing the notion of 'citizenship arenas' to identify three dynamics in social media-augmented corporate-society relations. First, we note that social media-augmented 'corporate arenas of citizenship' are constructed by individual corporations in an effort to address CSR issues of specific importance thereto, and are populated by individual citizens as well as (functional/formally organized) stakeholders. Second, we highlight that, within social media-augmented 'public arenas of citizenship', individual citizens are empowered, relative to corporations and their (functional/formally organized) stakeholders, when it comes to creating, debating, and publicizing, CSR-relevant issues. Third, we posit that information and communication technology corporations possess specific, and potentially very important, capacities, when it comes to creating, or helping construct, public arenas of citizenship from within which individual citizens can influence their broader political-economic environment. Following this, we discuss how social media can contribute to 'dysfunctions' as well as 'progressions' in corporate-society relations, and conclude with a number of suggestions for future research. © 2013 The Author(s).",Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Public sphere; Social media; Stakeholder,

While social media creates an important momentum for firms to cultivate favorable awareness by establishing a powerful framework of stakeholder relationships, the opportunities are not distributed evenly for all firms. In this paper, we investigate the impact of CSR credentials on the effectiveness of social media as a stakeholder-relationship management platform. The analysis of Fortune 500 companies in the Twitter sphere reveals that a higher CSR rating is a strong indicator of an earlier adoption, a faster establishment of online presence (followers), a higher responsiveness to the firm's identity (replies and mentions), and a stronger virality of the messages (retweets). Incidentally, the higher CSIR rating is also found to be associated with the stronger virality. Our findings also suggest that socially responsible firms can harvest proactive stakeholders' participation (user-driven communication) without investing more resources (firm-driven communication). As the first study that conceptualizes the social media as a proponent of CSR, this paper contends that ""being socially responsible"" makes more practical sense for firms with the rise of social media. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",CSIR; CSR; Social media; Twitter,

Using a sample of 10,363 firm-year observations from the Chinese stock market for the period of 2001-2010, I provide strong and robust evidence that religion (i.e., Buddhism and Taoism on the whole) is significantly negatively associated with owner-manager agency costs. In particular, using firm-level religion data measured by the number of religious sites within a radius of certain distance around a listed firm's registered address, I find that religion is significantly negatively (positively) associated with expense ratio (asset utilization ratio), the positive (reverse) proxy for owner-manager agency costs. This finding is consistent with the following view: religiosity has remarkable effects on the way how an individual thinks and behaves, and thereof can curb managers from unethical business practices. Moreover, my findings suggest that the negative association between religion and owner-manager agency costs is attenuated for firms with strong external monitoring mechanisms such as higher Marketization and high-quality auditors. Furthermore, after separating Buddhism from Taoism, my finding indicates that above conclusions are only available for Buddhism, suggesting that different religions may have asymmetric influence on owner-manager agency costs.

To study the effect of experience and social relationships on customer retention, we analyze a reality-mined co-presence network of health club members over a period of 4 years. Since central customers in the network have more social ties they will lose if they defect, we use centrality as a proxy for customer relationship switching costs. We find that long-standing customers do have a lower chance of renewing their contracts. However, in line with theoretical predictions (Burnham et al., Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 31(2):109-126, 2003), the consumer's centrality in the network (reflecting a social cost of defection) reduces customer churn rate. This study's results indicate that the inclusion of social effects increases the predictive power of the customer churn model (Nitzan and Libai, Journal of Marketing 75(6):24-38, 2011), thus contributing to our understanding of the role social networks play in customer decisions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Co-experience network; Co-presence data; Customer retention; Relational switching cost; Social networks,

In both the media and academia, the focus has very much been on the temporal level of the Incident. The political and legal dimensions, as well as the implications of the Incident in terms of human rights have all been pored over. However, what all of these discussions have overlooked is the role played by religious force during the Incident. The village of Wukan has a history of over four hundred years, and is deeply influenced by the religious beliefs of its people. Within both the system of religious beliefs and in everyday life in the village, the divine immortal Zhenxiu Xianweng and the religious rite of casting shengbei have a powerful influence. In times of peace, Xianweng and casting shengbei work to bestow good fortune, wealth and longevity on both the village itself, and the individuals who live there. During the Wukan Incident, they had a harmonizing influence, and helped to unify and protect the people. Looking at the specific roles played by religion throughout the Wukan Incident will not only enable us to develop a more meaningful understanding of the cultural nature and the complexity of the Incident itself, it will also enrich our understanding, on a divine level, of innovations in social management. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2013.",Casting shengbei; Innovations in social management; Religious force; Wukan Incident; Zhenxiu Xianweng,

If we look back over the process by which the villagers' organizations developed and they began to play a positive role, we find that their orientation changed so that they shifted from engaging in destroying the order to engaging in protecting the order; and shifted from being outside the state system to becoming part of it. They also eventually managed to reconstruct the relationship between government and NGO and achieve accord with government. However, it is not a foregone conclusion that organizations will operate in a rational way. Analysis of their role during the Wukan Incident shows that the involvement of an informal traditional elite; the inclusive nature and the social legitimacy of the organizations; and the attitude adopted by government in its response are all important prerequisites to the positive role of villagers' organizations being brought into play. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2013.",Autonomy of the masses; Ngo; Social management; Wukan,

Our research advances current knowledge of governance in family business by examining the implications of accountability theory to explore differences in the perceptions of accountability between family and nonfamily executives as a result of family firm monitoring. We examine the elements and linkages that form the basis of accountability in the context of firm characteristics uniquely common to family business and that are influential in the development of perceptions between executives of contrasting family status.

It pays particular attention to the social implications of success or failure of business development in mining contexts. Methodology/approach: This chapter is based upon ethnographic research and social impact monitoring studies conducted by the authors in Lihir between 1994 and 2012, as consultants and employees of the Lihir mining operation and as independent researchers. This chapter is also based upon broader research and consulting work undertaken by the authors at other mining locations throughout Papua New Guinea. The research is intended to explore the social changes generated by large-scale mining and related forms of business development, and the factors and strategies which constrain or enable landowners to get what they want from capitalism. Findings: Business development in resource extraction enclaves is structurally different from other nonresource development contexts and produces a more dependent and client-based approach to capitalism. In Lihir, research and ethnographic observations indicate that landowner business development is highly territorialized, which is captured by the landowner catch cry ""My land, my work."" Ultimately, mining has provided significant economic opportunities for the local community, but these economic changes, especially through the distribution of minederived benefits and opportunities for business development, have involved processes that have divided people and entrenched inequalities. Practical implications: In Papua New Guinea, the close relationship between property ownership, landed interests, and capitalist engagement creates steep challenges for sustainable business development in resource enclaves. This research provides a strong foundation for exploring alternative strategies for economic development.

We find that credit rating agencies tend to award relatively high ratings to firms with good social performance. This pattern is robust to controlling for key firm characteristics as well as endogeneity between CSR and credit ratings. We also find that CSR strengths and concerns influence credit ratings and that the individual components of CSR that relate to primary stakeholder management (i.e., community relations, diversity, employee relations, environmental performance, and product characteristics) matter most in explaining firms' creditworthiness. Overall, our results suggest that CSR performance conveys important non-financial information that rating agencies are likely to use in their evaluation of firms' creditworthiness, and that CSR investments-particularly those that extend beyond compliance behavior to reflect what is desired by society-can lead to lower financing costs resulting from higher credit ratings. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Credit ratings,

We specifically consider the Torah because it is the primary document of Judaism, the source of all the basic Biblical commandments, and a framework of ethics. A distinctive feature of Jewish ethics is its interpretive approach to moral philosophy: that is, immersion and sense making in a dense, lived-in, complicated moral world, which is particularly useful with regard to ethical analyses of the workplace. Rather than discover or create a new ethic for the employer-employee relationship, we seek to harness general principles and norms from the Torah to contemporary business conditions. In the spirit of sustainability, rather than plunder the new, we recreate from existing resources. Interpretations from the Torah provide a rich source of moral and practical guidance for contemporary business ethics while also responding to academic and popular interest in spirituality and business. These tenets, however, have not to date been specifically directed at current predicaments in employment. We redress this by deriving principles from the Torah and applying them to ethical issues in contemporary employment practices.

This study discusses such issue by proposing a research model based on the signaling theory and the expectancy theory. In the model, this study hypothesizes that the perceived corporate social performance of job seekers positively affects their job pursuit intention and recommendation intention indirectly via the mediation of corporate reputation and job advancement prospects. The proposed hypotheses of this research are empirically tested using the data from people seeking a job. The empirical findings of this study complement previous literature by discussing how corporate social performance benefits business organizations from a perspective of human resources and recruitment.

This research investigates how the characteristics of the stakeholder landscape influence a firm's CSP breadth. Using stakeholder theory, we specifically propose that several factors increase the salience and impact of stakeholders' demands on the firm and that, in response to these factors, a firm's CSP will have greater breadth. A firm's CSP breadth is operationalized as the number of different sub-domains of CSR for which a firm has taken positive actions and is captured using a unique dataset from Kinder, Lydenburg, and Domini (KLD). This data set includes positive and negative firm actions across more than 35 different dimensions of socially responsible behavior. Findings based on a longitudinal, multi-industry sample of 447 US firms during the period from 2000 to 2007 demonstrate that firms which: (1) have greater sensitivity to stakeholder needs as a result of the firm's strategic emphasis on marketing and/or value creation, (2) face greater diversity of stakeholder demands, and (3) encounter a greater degree of scrutiny or risk from stakeholder action have a greater breadth of CSP in response to the stakeholder landscape that they face. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate social performance (CSP); KLD database; Stakeholder theory,

We show that fast disclaimers greatly reduce consumer comprehension of product risks and benefits, creating implications for social responsibility. In addition, across two studies, we found that disclaimer speed and brand familiarity interact to predict brand trust and purchase intention, and that brand trust mediated the interactive effect of brand familiarity and disclaimer speed on purchase intention. Our results indicate that fast disclaimers actually reduce brand trust and purchase intention for unfamiliar brands, suggesting that there are both economic and social responsibility reasons to use less rapid disclaimers for unfamiliar brands. Conversely, disclaimer speed had no negative effects on brand trust and purchase intention for highly familiar brands, presenting ethical tensions between economic interests (e.g., an efficient use of advertisement time) and social responsibility. We discuss the implications of our framework for advertising ethics, for corporate social performance, and for corporate social responsibility. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Advertising ethics; Brands; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Disclaimer speed; Mediation; Purchase intention; Trust,

Due to its larger scope than the case of an individual port, regional port governance involves a higher number of stakeholders including policymakers at various levels, market players and community groups. Accordingly, stakeholder management becomes more complicated. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) in South China is a major port region with Hong Kong and Shenzhen being its largest ports. In view of Hong Kong's gradual integration within China's national and regional planning, there is an increasing need for cooperation among the ports in the PRD region, in order to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. This study aims to analyze the major conflicts and mutual benefits encountered by Hong Kong and Shenzhen ports and thereby formulate strategies for stakeholder management from the governmental perspective in establishing sustainable regional port governance. To establish a mega maritime and port cluster, we recommend forming an official inter-city governmental office to be in charge of port cooperation at the regional level so as to provide soft leadership for this purpose. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Pearl River Delta; Port cluster; Regional port governance; Stakeholder management,

Simultaneously, guidance regarding the practical details of 'how' to act in specific situations may be an important component of ethics education in emerging economies where intentions are easily frustrated by an overwhelming consciousness of operating in a corrupt environment. A group of Nigerian senior managers was challenged to generate a strategy to institute an ethical culture in an organization with a history of corruption.

However, making ethical assessments that in turn influence behavior is much more complicated than it appears. One of the most important developments in contemporary philosophy has been the renewed interest in epistemic virtue. Epistemologists contend that belief is an ethical process that is susceptible to the intellectual virtue or vice of one's own life and personal experiences. Open-mindedness, curiosity, careful thinking, creativity, and intellectual courage are the foundations of epistemic virtues. Closed-mindedness, intellectual overconfidence, unimaginativeness, intellectual conformity, and wishful thinking are among epistemic vices. The purpose of this investigation is to introduce epistemology to marketing ethics by linking it to personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism) and optimism to explain various ethically challenging organizational behaviors. The items of epistemology were developed and pretested by the lead author of this study. Structural equations (LISREL) analyses found that epistemic virtues and vices are better predictors of ethical behavior than were personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism), and their influence on mild and severe levels of unethical behaviors was enhanced by the moderator variable, optimism. Implications are designed to develop suggestions for improving ethical behavior in the workplace. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Epistemic vices; Epistemic virtues; Idealism; Optimism; Relativism; Unethical organizational practices; Virtue theory,

The positive indirect path suggested that yielding to temptation (e.g., high cognitive impairment and lack of self-control) led to poor MI (low stewardship behavior, but high cognitive meaning) that, in turn, led to high unethical intentions (theft, corruption, and deception). Our counterintuitive negative direct path revealed that those who controlled their temptation had high unethical intentions. Due to the multiple faces of temptation (the suppression effect), maliciously controlled temptation (low cognitive impairment and high self control) led to deviant intentions. Subsequent multi-group analysis across gender (a moderator) reformulated the mystery of temptation: a negative direct path for males, but a positive indirect path for females. For males, the negative direct path generated a dark impact on unethical intentions; for females, the positive indirect path did not, but offered great implications for consumer behavior.

They are likely to contribute to higher levels of accountability and awareness within corporations in respect of the negative impact of business activities on human rights. However, we identify tensions between the idea that the respect of human rights is a perfect moral duty for corporations and the Principle's 'human rights due diligence' requirement. We argue that the effectiveness of the 'human rights due diligence' is in many respects dependent upon the moral commitment of corporations. The Principles leave room for an instrumental or strategic implementation of due diligence, which in some cases could result in a depreciation of the fundamental norms they seek to promote. We reveal some limits of pragmatic approaches to coping with business-related human rights abuses. As these limits become more apparent, not only does the case for further progress in international and extraterritorial human rights law become more compelling, but so too does the argument for a more forceful discussion on the moral foundations of human rights duties for corporations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate responsibility; Human rights; Moral duties; Moral rights; Ruggie Principles,

Such recognition raises the potential for addressing issues that lead to divergent perceptions of justice, thus potentially improving the human rights performance of businesses. The research also shows the potential for complicity of businesses in human rights abuses and exposes a fundamental weakness in the UN Framework, which attempts to draw a sharp distinction between duties of States versus responsibilities of business.

Green knowledge refers to the awareness of climate change issues in everyday life. As much as business ethics has been given much attention in all spheres of academia, I argue that the expansion and adoption of green knowledge systems should be treated with urgency in institutions of higher education. The role of universities in societal transformation will thus lead to the appreciation of the consequences of climate change at grassroot level in modern society. This study therefore uses a survey technique to ascertain the use of green knowledge in teaching and learning among students in the College of Law and Management Studies at UKZN. A cluster comprising 225 students was used and a response rate of 58 percent was attained. The results show that students are conversant with climate change issues but do not engage themselves in green practices during teaching and learning for reasons such as the convenience of using printed materials, the high cost of electronic gadgets and resistance to change to newer techniques. Also the majority of the respondents support the idea of incorporating climate change issues in the university curricula although only 30 percent expressed a willingness to study a standalone module related to climate change. Finally, a green teaching and learning philosophy is proposed for higher education, which if adopted could lead to a green knowledge society.",Climate change; Green knowledge; Higher education; Teaching and learning,

We provide a theoretical explanation of why this will be the case using examples to illustrate. Subsequently, we set out an alternative theoretical framework for the purposes of investigating whether markets place a positive, or a negative, valuation on CSP, and show why this is superior to tests based upon Tobin's Q. Using US KLD data, we demonstrate that, as theorised, markets place a positive value on CSP that is not detected by conventional returns-based tests. Our conclusion is that researchers who are interested in the question of whether engagement with a corporate social responsibility agenda is a value-enhancing activity for a company (as argued by some stakeholder theorists) or value destructive (as argued by Friedman, The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits, The New York Times Magazine, 1970), need to look beyond returns-based tests to answer the research question posed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Corporate social performance; Valuation methods,

First, I delineate two fundamental criteria that I believe must be met for any such approach to be viable: viz., the virtues must be exercised for the sake of the good of one's life as a unitary whole (contra role-morality approaches) and for the common good of the communities of which one is a part as well as the individual good of their members (contra egoist approaches). Second, I argue that these two criteria can be met only if we are able to reconceive and transform the nature of work within contemporary business organizations. In particular, what is needed, I argue, is a retrieval of something like the older ideal of work as a ""vocation"", or ""calling"", whereby work can be viewed as a specific aspect of a more general calling to pursue, through the practice of the virtues, ""the good life"" both for ourselves and for others. Lastly, I consider some important challenges to this ""vocational virtue ethic"" approach to work within contemporary business organizations and offer a few suggestions for how they might be met. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aristotle; Bellah, Robert; Business Ethics; Calling; MacIntyre, Alasdair; Virtue Ethics; Vocation",

It is important that stakeholders with an interest in community economic development play an active role in the development of the rail network. Ample opportunity must be provided for meaningful input, and stakeholders must be aware that their issues have been heard and understood. Data collected through surveys, interviews, focus group discussions, and public meetings conducted across the state are used to develop a stakeholder engagement process.

Drawing on a statistical analysis of a large data set of marketplace campaigns and in-depth interviews with campaign proponents, consultants, and targeted executives, this article proposes a relational framework for understanding marketplace politics, situating campaign strategies in relation to targeted firms' brand vulnerabilities and corporate social responsibility (CSR) ""absorptive capacity,"" on the one hand, and parallel actions of key intermediaries-including investment advisory firms and pioneering competitors-on the other hand.

They are typically embedded in local communities and therefore well placed to influence community wellbeing. While there has been considerable theoretical and empirical analysis of corporate citizenship and corporate social responsibility (CSR), the nature of micro-business community responsibility (mBCR) remains relatively under-explored. This article presents findings from an exploratory study of mBCR that examined the approaches, motivations and barriers of this phenomenon. Analysis of data from 36 semi-structured interviews with micro-business owner-operators in the Australian city of Brisbane revealed three mBCR approaches, suggesting an observable mBCR typology. Each mBCR type was at least partly driven by enlightened self-interest (ESI). In addition to a pure ESI approach, findings revealed ESI combined with philanthropic approaches and ESI combined with social entrepreneurial approaches. The combination of doing business and doing good found amongst participants in this study suggests that many micro-business owner-operators are supporters of their local communities and, therefore, driven by more than profit.

The criteria are based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. Using the 3-year period from 2002 to 2005, we find that firm valuation is positive and significantly associated with CSP. Interestingly, this relation matters less in China related firms and firms with a concentrated ownership structure. The results also show that CSP impacts firm valuation more positively when the firm is in the service sector.

When managers consider whether or not to develop a business relationship with those from a different culture, their decision may be affected by actual differences in ethical profiles, but potentially even more so by their perceptions of ethicality in the counterpart culture. The latter issue has been largely ignored in extant empirical research regarding cross-cultural ethical profiles. In this study, we employ a design that allows for a more complete analysis of cross-cultural perspectives, examining both the manner in which selected cultures view themselves and the manner in which those same cultures perceive the ethical profiles of others. To this end, we surveyed master's students in business fields at several universities in the United States and China-two countries/cultures that engage in a significant amount of business transactions-and examined differences in personal ethical profiles across cultures, differences in one group's ethical profile and the way it is perceived by the other group, and differences in perceived ethical profiles across cultures; that is, differences in how groups view each other. Findings suggest meaningful discrepancies in the ethical perceptions formed toward the counterpart culture.

The purpose of this article is to illustrate that Cicero-lawyer, politician, orator and prolific writer, and one of the earliest experts in the field recognised the significance of moral behaviour in his society. Cicero wrote 'Moral Duties' (De Officiis) about 44 BC. He addressed the four cardinal virtues wisdom, justice, courage and temperance, illustrating how practical wisdom, theoretical/conceptual wisdom and justice were viewed in Rome of the first century BC. 'Moral Duties' is a letter admonishing his son, Marcus. It refers to personal behaviour, business practice and analyses terms such as good faith and criminal fraud. In addition, it contains material which would be suitable for tutorials/seminars and discussions, particularly in the areas of critical thinking in business ethics and general management. A study of De Officiis in respect to present day management and business practice could give a wider perspective to business ethics and management students. If concepts such as moral virtue, moral propriety and moral goodness, many of which seem to be ignored in business situations today, are to be embedded in business leaders of the future, it is reasonable to expect that these qualities will be analysed and discussed by business students today. Further, a study of Cicero's six-step approach, when preparing an address/speech, could be useful and productive for practitioners and students in this area. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Business practice; Cardinal virtues; First century BC Rome; Philosophy of morals; Prudent behaviour,

Using quantitative data collected from a sample of 171 Australian SMEs in the machinery and equipment manufacturing sector and employing structural equation modelling, we find that the adoption of practices in each CSR dimension by SMEs is influenced slightly differently by each capability, and affects financial performance differentially. The study also demonstrates the importance of the interaction between the three dimensions of proactive CSR in positively moderating the deployment of each individual CSR dimension to generate financial performance.

In this paper, using Bayesian causal maps (BCMs) methodology, relationships between legal and political environments of business and EBOF are investigated. The unique design of our study allows us to analyze these relationships based on the stages of development in 92 countries around the world. The EBOF models structured through BCMs are used to explain how EBOF in a given country group are shaped by how managers perceive political, legislative, and protective environments of business in these countries. The results suggest that irregular payments and bribes are the most influential factors affecting managers' perceptions of business ethics in relatively more advanced economies, whereas intellectual property protection is the most influential factor affecting managers' perceptions of business ethics in less-advanced economies. The results also suggest that regardless of where the business is conducted in the world, judicial independence is the driving force behind managers' perceptions of business ethics. In addition, the results of this study provide further support for scholars who argue that business ethics is likely to vary among countries based on their socio-economic factors.

Many prior studies have looked at CSD practice from the managerial perspective, while providing less of an insight into non-managerial stakeholder perspectives. Several researchers have argued that the social and environmental accounting literature needs to incorporate the voice of non-managerial stakeholders in CSD development. This paper contributes to the stakeholder-perception-based CSD literature. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in selected social and environmental NGOs of both overseas and Bangladeshi origin. The results suggest that NGO executives are sceptical of current CSD practice. To them, current CSD is ad hoc and no more than a public relations exercise, lacking credibility. Most importantly, owing to structural constraints NGO executives assign lesser significance to CSD than to direct corporate involvement in social development. They described structural constraints as: high levels of poverty, weak governmental structures, dependence on foreign aid and a small group of local business people, lack of awareness of CSD, and an underdeveloped stakeholder relationship. All of these constraints are embedded within the socio-cultural and political history of Bangladesh. NGO executives believe strongly in action rather than words. They suggest that corporations need to engage in social development and to improve their social performance in order to meet their social and environmental responsibilities to the Bangladeshi people. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Bangladesh; Corporate social disclosure; Non-Governmental organisations,

Previous research on organizational diversity climate, for the most part, has neglected to consider the influence of community diversity climate on employment relations. In order to address this gap in the literature, we examined the relationship between organizational and community diversity climates in impacting employees' intent to stay with their organization. In doing so, we tested two competing hypotheses. First, we tested for the positive spillover of community diversity climate on employees' intent to stay in their organization. Second, we tested for the compensation hypothesis, whereby community diversity climate moderated the organizational diversity climate-employee intent to stay relationship, with the above relationship being stronger for individuals hailing from communities with poor diversity climates. In addition, we also posited a three-way interaction model of community diversity climate, organizational diversity climate, and employee racial affiliations with the interaction between organizational and community diversity climates on intent to stay being stronger for the minority employees. The results of the study, which are based on a survey of 165 employees working in a Midwestern US organization, supported the compensation hypothesis with the interactive influence of organizational and community diversity climates on employee intent to stay being stronger for minorities, as opposed to White employees. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Compensation; Diversity climate; Race; Spillover,

When humans moved into settled communities, with more advanced means of production, the nature of fear-much like the nature of social relationships-changed. Once the means of social reproduction were secured, fear became less necessary as a survival instinct, and more useful as a heuristic device. Fear cannot be characterized as an essentially socially constructed phenomenon, or as the self-contained, individualized response to internalized traumas. The growth and nature of fear must be studied as a process that develops under its own inertia and as a phenomenon that is both shaped by and shapes its institutional setting. Fear should be understood as both structurally determined and socially transformative.

Although social exchange theorists have directed their attention to the universality of the norms of reciprocation and have indicated the prevalence of an instrumental view of reciprocity, we elaborate on the cross-cultural variations that exist regarding the way individuals view and apply the principle of reciprocation in the countries which we examine. To understand these variations, we discuss the pivotal cultural/historical conditions that seem to shape social exchanges and therefore country differences in favors exchanges. For example, while social relationships and the collective play a preponderant role in these three countries, the exchange of favors in China and India is primarily based on hierarchically-defined and ascriptive ties compared to Japan where relationships' formation go beyond ethnicity, kinship, and family-oriented ties and are likely to be defined by the group membership. Finally, we end our discussion of favors by highlighting the bright and dark sides focusing on their use in the organizational milieu.

Significant suspicion nonetheless remains about the motives and impact of corporations acting in domains traditionally served by government and ""third-sector"" organizations. We argue that such ambivalence undermines the perceived legitimacy of private investments in public goods, and that this fundamental liability of privateness (LOP) constitutes a significant obstacle to corporations acting in the public domain through corporate citizenship initiatives. For multinational corporations (MNCs), the challenges stemming from the LOP are further amplified by the liability of foreignness (LOF) commonly associated with international business operations. We discuss the origins of the LOP and derive implications of the ""dual liability"" of LOP and LOF for partnering choices in MNCs' corporate citizenship programs. We highlight limitations on the set of credible governance mechanisms available to participants in these partnerships, describe a set of alternative governance arrangements that serve to realign incentives among alliance partners, and link these to the severity of the LOP in a particular setting.

Inspired by recent work on epistemic virtues in philosophy, I develop a view in which epistemic virtues contribute to the acquisition of knowledge that is instrumentally valuable in the realisation of particular ends, business ends in particular. I propose a conception of inquiry according to which epistemic actions involve investigation, belief adoption and justification, and relate this to the traditional 'justified true belief' analysis of knowledge. I defend the view that epistemic virtues enable and/or motivate people to perform epistemic actions. An examination of the key epistemic virtues of love of knowledge, epistemic courage, temperance, justice, generosity and humility provides some initial evidence suggesting that the way epistemic virtues enable or motivate is by countering a number of biases that have been uncovered by behavioural economics, and also indicates ways in which the instrumental epistemic value view is superior to other approaches to epistemic virtue offered in the literature. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Epistemic virtues; Information; Information sharing; Knowledge; Search behaviour; Virtue theory,

We analyze the disclosures of the 100 U.S. Best Corporate Citizens in the period 2005-2007, and we posit a series of simultaneous relationships between different attributes of the governance system and a multidimensional construct of corporate social performance (CSP). We consider both the extent and the quality of SED, with the purpose of identifying increasing levels of corporate commitment to stakeholders and shedding some light on whether SED is used as a signal or rather as a legitimacy tool. Our empirical evidence shows that the stakeholders' orientation of corporate governance is positively associated with CSP and SED. On the other hand, we do not find support for the monitoring intensity of corporate governance being negatively associated with social performance. We also find that CSP in the ""product"" dimension is positively associated with the extent and quality of SED whilst CSP in the ""people"" dimension is negatively associated with the extent and quality of SED. At a time when shareholders and stakeholders share more common aspects in their relationships with firms, this is a significant area to explore and this research fills an important lacuna in this respect. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Monitoring; Social and environmental disclosure; Structural equation modeling,

Hence, virtue ethicists ride happily to the rescue, offering to replace or complement Kant's theory with their own. Before such efforts are undertaken, however, one should recognize that Kant himself wrote a ""virtue theory"" (Tugendlehre), wherein he discussed the questions of character as well as the teleological nature of human action. Numerous Kant scholars argue that Kant already erected precisely the kind of integrative moral architecture that some of his modern interpreters (while aiming to supersede him) wish to construct. For business ethics, this divergence of scholarly opinion is of crucial importance. It shows first that the standard portrayals of Kant's ethics in business ethics textbooks-as rigidly deontological, narrowly individualistic, and hence unsuitable for the specific demands of corporate agency-might have to be revised. Second, discussions in the business ethics literature on stakeholder-engagement and managerial decision-making likewise stand to gain from a more nuanced picture of Kant's moral philosophy. Third, a reassessment of Kant's ethics with regard to questions of personal character and moral sentiments might also lead to a more favorable view of the relevance of his ethics for managerial practice. Last, but not least, the many current attempts to reconcile Kant's freedom-oriented philosophy with virtue theories stand to benefit considerably from a better understanding of how Kant himself conceived of one such synthesis between the formal and substantial aspects of morality. This, ultimately, could lead to an important overlapping consensus in the academic literature as to the role and relevance of virtuous conduct in business. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Deontology; Formalism; Kant; Kantian; Teleology; Virtue ethics,

Particular attention is given to the fundamental emphasis placed by Soto in distinguishing between commerce as an activity and the specific conduct of persons engaging in commercial activity. The distinction between the material and the formal parts of the common good is then employed to shed light on the way Soto articulates commercial practices, virtuous character, and the common good. It is concluded that Soto's major contribution for business ethics is clarifying that the key element for the ethical evaluation of commerce is the embodiment of virtuous personal conduct in the exercise of commercial activity. In this framework, the fulfillment of commerce's potential to contribute to the common good is thus fundamentally interconnected with putting virtues into practice. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Character; Commerce; Commercial practices; Common good principle; Domingo de Soto; School of Salamanca; Virtue,

Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected by KLD Research Analytics and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the study examines the association between companies' choice of approaches to the CSR and CSR-CP relationship. Findings: Results of this study indicate that each of the three approaches to CSR - descriptive, instrumental, and strategic - are associated with CP, but in different ways. While the instrumental approach to CSR has a positive association with short-term measures of CP, the strategic approach is associated with short-term and medium-term measures of CP, and the descriptive approach has no definite association with CP at all. Originality/value: This study integrates the prevailing justifications for CSR with the taxonomy of approaches to CSR - instrumental, descriptive and strategic - suggested in the literature. It has been argued that these frameworks influence managers' conception of what constitutes effective stakeholder management and make a difference in how decision makers in an organization think and act in crafting the company's social initiatives and in deciding what the company aims to achieve through these initiatives.

The Program opens opportunities for small suppliers, not only in the Pão de Açúcar chain but also among competitors and in other industries. The Program established some requirements for the producer to become a supplier, aiming to adapt the products to a regular commercialization with the Group. In this way, small producers can now rely on a complete business process, while beforehand the goods were sold mostly through small channels. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Business ethics; Business inclusion; Business insertion; Poverty alleviation; Small-sized suppliers; Social responsibility; Sustainability,

In the present study, the author reexamines this issue, building on insights into managerial risk taking from the behavioral theory of the firm and hypothesizing that the slope of the profitability-safety relationship reaches an inflection point at the organizational profitability aspiration.

The report portrayed an industry distrusted by stakeholders and under threat from opposition groups. When read closely, the MMSD report reveals an inextricable link between industry's 'survival' instincts and the notion of a social licence. Within the context of a growing divergence around the expectations of minerals-led development, social licence has emerged as an industry response to opposition and a mechanism to ensure the viability of the sector. The objective of this article is to reinvigorate discussion and debate over how best to frame the industry's social and environmental obligations and how these obligations can be met by the sector. Where social licence has contributed to raising the profile of social issues within a predominantly industrial discourse, a primary failure is its inability to articulate a collaborative developmental agenda for the sector or a pathway forward in restoring the lost confidence of impacted communities, stakeholders, and pressure groups. We argue that a necessary first step in this process is for industry to reconcile its internal risk-orientation with external expectations which requires a less defensive and more constructive approach to stakeholder engagement and collaboration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Corporate social responsibility; Engagement; L20; Mining; Social licence; Stakeholder; Sustainable development,Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Engagement; L20; Social licence; Stakeholder; Economic and social effects; Mining; Planning; Sustainable development; Industry; corporate strategy; mining; mining industry; stakeholder; sustainable development

Using legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory, the paper identifies newly emerged stakeholder groups for listed Chinese firms during three distinguished periods of the development of the Chinese stock market. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data analysis was undertaken over a period from 1995-2006 with an aim to examine the influence of stakeholder power changes on voluntary disclosures made by 297 listed firms in their 12 years of annual reports. A voluntary disclosure checklist has been used for hand-collecting data from annual reports. Findings: The finding shows that different stakeholder groups exert different degrees of influence on firms' decision-making in respect of information disclosure during different stages of the development of the Chinese stock market. Research limitations/implications: The impact of a stakeholder power changes on corporate disclosure has not been well addressed and how listed Chinese firms respond to these changes is still a significant gap in the Chinese corporate disclosure literature. In this study, the paper uses proxies to represent each stakeholder group, discuss power changes of each group and predict the impact of power changes on firms' voluntary disclosure. Originality/value: The paper identifies the new content of the ""social contract"" between listed firms and Chinese society and identifies various stakeholder groups of listed Chinese firms in the context of a new ""social contract"". The paper predicts that voluntary corporate disclosure is the result of stakeholder pressures and firms use voluntary disclosure as one of their strategies to manage the firm-stakeholder relationship. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",China; Chinese stock market; Disclosure; Stakeholder theory; Stock markets; Voluntary disclosure,

The objective of this paper is to make the case for why internal and external auditors should leverage the capabilities process mining offers to rethink how auditing is carried out. We do so by identifying the sources of value added of process mining when applied to auditing, which are as follows: 1. process mining analyzes the entire population of data and not just a sample; 2. critically that data consists of meta-data-data entered independently of the actions of auditee-and not just data entered by the auditee; 3. process mining allows the auditor to have a more effective way of implementing the audit risk model by providing effective ways of conducting the required walkthroughs of processes and conducting analytic procedures; 4. process mining allows the auditor to conduct analyses not possible with existing audit tools, such as discovering the ways in which business processes are actually being carried out in practice, and to identify social relationships between individuals. It is our argument that these sources of value have not been fully understood in the process mining literature, which has focused on developing it as a statistical methodology rather than on applying it to audit practice. Only when auditors and audit researchers appreciate what is new and unique about process mining will its acceptance in auditing practice become feasible. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Continuous auditing; Event logs; Internal auditing; Process mining,

Pearce II J.A.,Using Social Identity Theory to Predict Managers' Emphases on Ethical and Legal Values in Judging Business Issues,2013,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84872823646&partnerID=40&md5=bbbc3ebb20d0d7ff6bb6be959cb6536e,"The need to fill three gaps in ethics research in a business context sparked the current study. First, the distinction between the concepts of ""ethical"" and ""legal"" needs to be incorporated into theory building and empiricism. Second, a unifying theory is needed that can explain the variables that influence managers to emphasize ethics and legality in their judgments. Third, empirical evidence is needed to confirm the predictive power of the unifying theory, the discernable influence of personal and organizational variables, and the importance of the issue to the managers in determining their emphasis on the ethical and legal values of their judgments. Focused on these needs, the current research combines social identity theory with empirical findings from business ethics research. This theory building initiative framed hypothesis-driven research to investigate the influences on managers' emphasis on ethical and legal values in making business judgments. An empirical research study was conducted involving 252 practicing managers who judged 12 newsworthy business events. Data was collected on the managers' individual factors, on the groups that influence their judgments, and on the importance that the managers place on ethics and legality in judging the 12 scenarios. The research findings contribute to theory development (1) By successfully utilizing a blended extension of social identity and issue-contingent theories to understand managers' judgments, and (2) By providing evidence on the relationships between the perceived importance of an issue and the emphases managers place on ethical and legal values in their judgments. The analysis of the data was extended to provide insights on the needs of employers to tailor management training on legal and ethical decision-making. The participating managers were clustered according to their emphases on Ethical Importance and Legal Importance in judging business situations. Analysis of Variance was then combined with Scheffé Multiple Comparison Tests to assess whether the factors derived from a blended extension of social identity and issue-contingent theories were significantly different across the clusters. The product of this analysis is unique sets of attributes that describe each cluster of managers, and provide an empirical basis for determining training priorities. Finally, the carefully constructed and thoroughly tested 12 research scenarios that form the core of the survey instrument enable their redeployment in subsequent research and their use by practicing executives who wish to compare data provided by their managers to results from the study participants. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cluster analysis; Ethics; Influencing judgment; Issue-contingent theories of identity; Legality; Organizational variables; Scenario development; Social identity theory,

Preston (1999) traces the notion of stakeholders back to the great depression in the United States (1929-1941), when the General Electric company defined four major stakeholder groups -shareholders, employees, customers, and the general public. Stakeholder management has become an important tool to transfer ethics to management practice and strategy. Few management topics have generated more debate in recent decades than the underlying notion, the model and the theories surrounding stakeholders (Donaldson and Preston, 1995; Gibson, 2000; Wolfe and Putler, 2002; Friedman and Miles, 2006). The visual power of the stakeholder model and its high simplicity are seen as contributors to the success of the stakeholder concept (Fassin, 2008). An increasing interrelation is observed between the concepts of stakeholder theory, corporate responsibility, and business ethics (Valor, 2005; Garriga et al., 2004). The stakeholder approach in the organization integrates stakeholder relationships within a company’s resource base, industry setting, and socio-political arena into a single analytical framework (Susniene & Sargunas, 2009).Mumford (1979) is one of the early researchers in supporting the involvement of end-users as a component of effective in-formation systems development and implementation, using essentially the stakeholder concept in this domain. It has been proved that end-users and managers are very important towards successful system implementation. As more interorganizational information systems are developed which usually involve strategic decisions, a yet wider range of stakeholders needs to be involved (Pouloudi, 1999). In these systems the attention may switch from end-users and focus on those parties that are external to the organization, but who can also be associated in decision making at a managerial or strategic level (Pouloudi & Whitely, 1997). One of the most thorough investigations of the stakeholder concept in information systems research that relates information systems stakeholders with implementation failure was made as an early work by Lyytinen and Hirschheim (1987, 1988). They argue that failure is conditional on the capability of information system to meet the expectations of different stakeholders -i.e. to say an information system may be considered successful by some stakeholder but a failure by others. The concept of stakeholder represents a progression from developer – and user – centered problems to organization-wide and inter organizational information system problems. This is a sign of maturity of information systems research to show how holistic representation of the parties involved in the more complex systems currently developed (Pouloudi, 1999). Stakeholder theory proposes an ethical use of stakeholder concept in Information systems as ethical considerations and professional conduct is a significant issue in information system.The stakeholder theory is extensively used in management in investigating organizational ambiance, strategic management, ethical concerns, business planning process, e-government, project management, environment management, etc. Recently stakeholders are also seen as means to more successful information and communication technologies and information system development and implementation issues. The paper presents stakeholder theory, its origin and applications in Information Systems (IS) field in the literature. The main objective of this research is to build up the knowledge body of stakeholder applications in information systems and technology areas. © 2013, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The empirical analysis, based on a sample of 126 firms drawn from the S&P500 group of companies over a 5-year period, suggests that board gender diversity (BGD) significantly affects CSP. However, this impact depends on the social performance metric under investigation. In particular, more gender diverse boards exert stronger influence on CSP metrics focusing on 'negative' business practices, such as the 'concerns' dimension of the Kinder Lydenberg Domini, Inc. (KLD) ratings. This is because such CSP ratings have the potential to induce higher levels of 'empathic caring', which strongly appeals to female directors. Hence, this study reveals further hidden connections in the BGD-CSP link which have important implications for managers, nongovernmental organisations and socially responsible investors. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Board gender diversity; Corporate social performance; Empathy; Ethics of care; Feminist ethics; Gender stereotypes; Social role theory,

Against this background, it is the first aim of this paper to examine the socio-economic environment for corporate citizenship in both countries. Second, it will be investigated if corporate citizenship is really practiced more widely in the United States than in Germany and what forms of corporate citizenship are used by businesses. For that purpose, the corporate citizenship activities of the 100 largest companies in the United States and Germany each will be analyzed. Results show that more US than German companies undertake corporate citizenship activities and apply a wider variety of different forms.

The instrumental dominant logic of cause-related marketing focuses on attracting customers' attention in order to generate sales. The relational dominant logic of cause-related marketing focuses on building relationships with the target stakeholders through the enhancement of a firm's legitimacy. The combination of these two types of logic gives rise to four types of cause-related marketing: altruistic, commercial, social and integrative.

Eleven factors came out as fundamental, although they were less able to explain the variation in the attitudes than the previous study. A significant change in the rankings of variables was noted and indicated a shift in attitude toward a teleological moral philosophy as well as utilitarian motives.

Many more companies have come under the spotlight of activist attention as the agenda social activists address has expanded, provoked in part by the internationalization of business. During the past fifteen years, companies have begun to formulate corporate responsibility (CR) policies and appointed management teams dedicated to CR, resulting in a change in the way companies interact with social activists. This paper presents findings from a longitudinal case study of managerial responses to social activism targeted at a company with relatively well-advanced CR practices and reputation. The case describes the unfolding of the internal processes over an 8-year period, including the role played by different managers and the tensions in the decision-making processes. The findings emphasize how values and beliefs in the company interact with economic arguments and how those are mediated through functions and relationships in the company and beyond.

However, the dominant direction of stakeholder pressures can also change, namely, from supporting resource heterogeneity at the firm level to fostering industry homogeneity, and vice versa. When dominant stakeholder pressures shift from supporting heterogeneity towards stimulating homogeneity in industry, the firm must engage in level 2 or transformational adaptation. Stakeholders typically provide valuable resources to the firm in an early stage. Without these resources, which foster heterogeneity (in line with RBV thinking), the firm would not exist. At a later stage, stakeholders also contribute to inter-firm homogeneity via isomorphism pressures (in line with institutional theory thinking). Adding a temporal dimension to stakeholder management theory has far reaching implications for this theory's practical relevance to senior level management in business. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Competitive advantage; Institutional theory; Resource-based view; Stakeholder management theory; Temporal perspective,

By examining citations from articles published in three top business ethics journals (Journal of Business Ethics, Business Ethics Quarterly and Business Ethics: A European Review) over the period 2004-2008, we document that the preponderance of influential business ethics research comes primarily from the management faculty. In addition, management journals and management books are the predominant sources for influential business ethics research. Further, among the management fields, organizational behavior and organizational structure predominate leadership and strategy as the major subject areas for influential business ethics research, suggesting that this influential body of research is focused on a micro rather than on a macro context. These empirical results lend credence to the perception that there is a silo effect in influential business ethics research and suggest that business ethics research in a micro context might have permeated to the teaching of business ethics. © 2013 The Authors.",,

In particular, little is known about how corporate decision-makers privately reconcile the conflicts between public and private interests, even though this is likely to be relevant to understanding the limitations of CSR as a means of aligning business activity with the broader public interest. This study addresses this issue using internal tobacco industry documents to explore British-American Tobacco's (BAT) thinking on CSR and its effects on the company's CSR Programme. The article presents a three-stage model of CSR development, based on Sykes and Matza's theory of techniques of neutralization, which links together: how BAT managers made sense of the company's declining political authority in the mid-1990s; how they subsequently justified the use of CSR as a tool of stakeholder management aimed at diffusing the political impact of public health advocates by breaking up political constituencies working towards evidence-based tobacco regulation; and how CSR works ideologically to shape stakeholders' perceptions of the relative merits of competing approaches to tobacco control. Our analysis has three implications for research and practice. First, it underlines the importance of approaching corporate managers' public comments on CSR critically and situating them in their economic, political and historical contexts. Second, it illustrates the importance of focusing on the political aims and effects of CSR. Third, by showing how CSR practices are used to stymie evidence-based government regulation, the article underlines the importance of highlighting and developing matrices to assess the negative social impacts of CSR. © 2012 The Author(s).",Corporate political activity; Corporate social responsibility; Political CSR; Stakeholder management; Techniques of neutralization,

I suggest that legal and psychological research streams can be drawn upon to create a new genre of critical business ethics that differs from normative and empirical business ethics. In psychology, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) suggests how the mainstream ideology within an academic field can be criticized as a reflection of a self-righteous, us-them mind-set. In law, Critical Legal Studies (CLS) suggests how a field's mainstream ideology can be criticized as a rationalization of the status quo. I suggest that the MFT and CLS criticisms of ideology can be joined to develop a critical approach to business ethics that seriously examines science on normatively charged topics, such as liberal-conservative differences and implicit attitudes, and that frames it in terms of alternative narratives.",Critical business ethics; Critical legal studies; Ideology; Moral foundations theory,

By educating those held most responsible for the crisis - financial traders and speculators - they are said to have produced ruthlessly talented graduates who have ambition in abundance but little sense for social responsibility or ethics. This ethical lack thrives upon the trading floor within a compelling critique of the complicity of the pedagogy of the business school with the financial crisis of the global economy. An ethical turn within the curriculum is now widely encouraged as a counteractive force. Within this paper, however, we argue that taking this ethical turn is not enough. For business ethicists to learn from the financial crisis, the crisis' legacy needs to be taken account of, and financialisation needs to be taken seriously. Pedagogical reform cannot bracket itself off from the crisis as if it were coincidental with or separate from it. Post-crisis pedagogy must rather take the fact that it is requested now, in light of the crisis, as its very point of departure. The financial crisis must not be understood as something to be resisted in the name of Business Ethics. Instead, the financial crisis must be understood as the very foundation for contemporary Business Ethics in particular and for contemporary business and management education more generally. © 2012 The Authors.",,

Further, because for Badiou there cannot be economic truths per se - rather, economic matters must be understood in their relation to one or more truths in the domain of love, art, science or politics - a Badiouian business ethics would look entirely distinct from any ethics that simply places limits on certain kinds of economic activity. Although Slavoj Žižek, among others, has suggested that this marks an essential weakness in Badiou's economic/political theory, it may actually be the greatest strength of his position. Within a capitalist system, a Badiouian business ethics would then be a question of mobilizing economic resources in order to serve the ongoing construction of a truth procedure. For a business to be considered ethical on Badiou's terms, it must break - and continue to break - from the dominant logic of capitalism and its merely economic pursuit of profit maximization. © 2013 The Author.",,

Rather than proceed to support the stakeholder paradigm, a conception of vulnerability is combined with Heath's 2004) ""market failure"" view of the ethical obligations of managers as falling out of their roles as professionals involved in the institution of the market.

Dialogue, an alternative to shareholder resolutions filed by activists, is a process in which corporations and activist shareholder groups mutually agree to engage in ongoing negotiations to deal with social issues. Based on a unique dataset of resolutions filed by member organizations of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility from 2002 to 2005 and the outcomes of these resolutions, our analysis finds that corporate managers are more likely to engage in dialogue with shareholder activists when the firm is larger, is more responsive to stakeholders, the CEO is the board chair, and the firm has a relatively lower percentage of institutional investors. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Dialogue; Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility; Shareholder activism; Shareholder resolutions; Social activism,

It is found that in Ukraine only 19.35% of non-financial statements fully comply with the principles of information quality assurance. The author concludes that all the firms by the coverage of business ethics in nonfinancial reporting can be divided into the following groups: amoral, conventionally moral, ethically relative and ethically universal.

The results from this study revealed that the pattern of networks between entrepreneurial ventures and their inter-relationships with different stakeholders varies according to each category of performance. For instance, while high entrepreneurial performers show a high degree of density of relationships and develop in-depth interactions with current major suppliers, customers and close relatives, low entrepreneurial performers reveal the opposite pattern. This paper also shows the relevance of social network analysis as a potential tool for researchers and managers. A key contribution of network analysis is that it allows analyzing the structural patterns of connected systems.

Competition might be permissible in the first case since markets are special patterns of social interactions (called adversarial schemes). They produce their benefits when agents try to satisfy exclusive preferences at the expense of others. However, moral obligations inside the firm and moral obligations outside the market are of a different nature. This argument will be developed in the two first parts of this paper.

The fleets themselves comprise fishers from small family enterprises to large vertically integrated businesses. The Queensland trawl fishery in Australia is used as a case study for this kind of fishery. It has the added complexity that a large part of the fishery is within a World Heritage Area, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which is managed by an agency of the Australian Commonwealth Government whereas the fishery itself is managed by the Queensland State Government.

In 1999 the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) developed comprehensive guidelines in its International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-sharks), which was followed by corresponding national plans in some nations. A case study of national implementation is presented here. Specifically, progress under Canada's National Plan of Action for Sharks (NPOA-sharks) is reviewed, against its stated goals, against Australia's NPOA, and against the original FAO guidelines. For comprehensiveness, additional management and conservation measures for sharks, as well as stakeholder input from the first Atlantic Shark Forum is provided. Although Canada is recognized as a leader in shark management, as it was one of the first countries to develop an NPOA, it has not effectively adopted the FAO's principles and guidelines. The plan lacks set timelines, priorities, and action plans to mitigate threats to sharks, and contains no performance indicators. Additionally, the plan neglects to identify priority species and engage stakeholders, and cannot be directly linked to management measures. To advance the revision of this plan (as well as other NPOAs), a stepwise process is recommended that includes (i) stakeholder engagement and development of a shark assessment report (SAR) (ii) addressing all IPOA objectives, while prioritizing issues arising from the SAR, and (iii) implementations of actions, targets, and timelines that are reviewed every four years. Key policy items to advance Canada's role in shark conservation and management are also presented. These include actions to improve data collection and research, management, and education, as well as coordination with stakeholders. In conclusion, major changes are needed to the existing NPOA to be fully effective and accountable. Likewise, the abovementioned measures may help guide more proactive plans in nations that have not yet established an NPOA. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Elasmobranchs; FAO; Fisheries management; NPOA; Sharks,action plan; conservation management; environmental assessment; fishery management; guideline; national planning; policy implementation; shark; species conservation; stakeholder; Canada; Chondrichthyes; Elasmobranchii; Ipoa

This analysis reveals that the ""value fit"" approach to creating authenticity is limited, and also indicates that a deeper exploration of the nature of values and the role of leadership is necessary. More specifically, we propose that organizational values should be viewed as an opportunity for ongoing conversations about who we are and how we connect. Through this type of dialogue which we define as ""value through conversation"", we can create what we call poetic organizations. A typology of four interconnected values each of which forms a foundation for the critical questioning and inquiry that might be found in poetic organizations is developed.

This characterization of trust is best thought of as epistemological because epistemic states distinguish trust from other dispositions. The epistemological characterization of trust is the amoral one referred to in the title of this paper, and we argue that this characterization is conceptually inadequate. We outline and defend an alternative conception of trust as a moral phenomenon: when A trusts B to do something, A invites B to acknowledge and accept an obligation; when B accepts the invitation, B takes on an obligation; in that way trust creates an obligation. We conclude with an application, drawing out the difference between the epistemological conception of trust and our own in the context of Ghoshal et al.'s (Sloan Management Review 40:9-20, 1995, Academy of Management Learning & Education 4:75-91, 2005) critique of transaction cost theories of the firm. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Moral relationships; Organizational ethics; Transaction cost theory of the firm; Trust,

This study examines an ethic of care approach to crisis management analysing the case of Northern Rock bank which was at the centre of the recent financial crisis in the UK. The development and maintenance of relationships is fundamental to an ethic of care approach and the research recognises this by examining the bank-stakeholder relationship both before and after the crisis. Considerable anger was directed at the bank post-crisis and, subsequently, the management team resigned. An important contention is that because an ethic of care approach had not been followed external parties judged that management should have foreseen the crisis and the harm caused was deemed intentional, even though predicting the crisis would have been difficult and it is improbable any harm was intended. Additionally, this negative reaction was heightened due to three facets of Northern Rock's history: (i) its previous existence as a building society, (ii) the 'local' nature of the bank and (iii) the creation of The Northern Rock Foundation. These historical factors caused local stakeholders to presume a 'caring' relationship between themselves, and the bank had continued to exist post-demutualisation. The events of the crisis compelled stakeholders to re-appraise this presumption, amplifying the post-crisis anger. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bank; Crisis; Crisis management; Ethic of care; Foresight; Intention,

How sunao as a value, influences the process of interpreting intercultural behaviour in relation to providing accounts, excuses or apologies in situations where a breach of some norm has occurred, is also explained. Although sunao has a particular role in hierarchical relationships between manager and subordinate, the paper concludes that becoming mutually sunao is crucial in learning and understanding the perspectives and expectations of a counterpart so that trust can deepen and flourish.

Recently, Lynn et al. (Journal of Business Ethics 85:227-243, 2009) argued that the ability to integrate the specific beliefs and practices of one's faith with the work one does represent an important although neglected area of research. As such, they developed and demonstrated convergent validity for the faith at work scale, designed to measure the extent to which individuals believe they are able to integrate their Judaeo-Christian beliefs and practices and their work. In a subsequent study, Lynn et al. (Human Relations 64:675-701, 2010) demonstrated that the faith at work scale was related to faith maturity, church attendance, age, and denominational strictness, and negatively associated with organizational size. No research, however, has examined the possible positive benefits of integrating faith and work. I therefore developed and tested hypotheses concerning the relationship between the faith at work scale and seven important life and work outcomes (satisfaction with life, intent to leave one's job, self-rated job performance, job satisfaction, and three forms of organizational commitment).

Complicit decoupling evolves over time, beginning with the creation of a new practice, here corporate ratings as a form of policing work, which emerges to help to maintain a core insti-tution. This practice is then adopted, implemented and later becomes decoupled. Exposure does not undermine the legitimacy of the practice because external actors collude in the 'window dressing' and, because it has become normalized, only partial repairs are enacted.

To make our case, we employ a utilitarian moral standard and examine the apparent logical sequence behind the link between shareholder wealth maximization and social welfare. Upon close empirical and conceptual scrutiny, we find that utilitarian criteria do not support the shareholder model; that is, shareholder wealth maximization is only weakly linked to social welfare maximization. In view of the dubious validity of this sequential argument, we outline some of the features of a superior corporate objective-a variant of normative stakeholder theory.

Attending to them simultaneously creates tensions, competing demands, and ethical dilemmas. Effectively understanding social enterprises therefore depends on insight into the nature and management of these tensions. While existing research recognizes tensions between social missions and business ventures, we lack any systematic analysis. Our paper addresses this issue. We first categorize the types of tensions that arise between social missions and business ventures, emphasizing their prevalence and variety. We then explore how four different organizational theories offer insight into these tensions, and we develop an agenda for future research. We end by arguing that a focus on social-business tensions not only expands insight into social enterprises, but also provides an opportunity for research on social enterprises to inform traditional organizational theories.

Academic efforts primarily focus on prevention while practitioners are often left to hold firms and executives (including directors) accountable through a variety of sanctions. Even so, executive malfeasance still occurs even in the face of the vast resources used to monitor, control, and penalize firms and executives. In this paper, we posit equity markets do not adequately penalize firms for inaccurate earnings reports. Using a sample of 129 firms identified by the U.S. General Accounting Office for reporting fraudulent earnings in 10K filings, we found support for our assertion. Consequently, the one party who may benefit but escape accountability is firm shareholders. Moreover, we find little empirical evidence that the subset of firms sanctioned by the SEC is penalized more heavily than the full sample by markets at the time they report and correct their 10K filings. Our results raise serious questions whether such managerial opportunism can be eradicated given the apparent lack of consequences in equity markets for investors.

Revealing the long-term orientation as the variable which permits us to link the principal goal of organization, being ""survival,"" with innovation and ethic, the article devises a framework for incorporating ethics into a company's processes and strategies for innovation. With the principal goal of organizations being ""survival"" in the long-term, it is assumed that innovation is necessary in order to realize a going concern. Firms that do not innovate and adapt to rapidly changing business environments are less likely to be sustainable. Thus, it is in a business' best interests to adopt an innovation process for long-term success. We posit that there are two simultaneous sources of innovation and change that are unavoidable and embedded in the corporate landscape. First, we argue for genetically embedded, Darwinian explanations for adaptations that enable an entity's survival. This view is combined with more conventional, social science explanations for change. Our new, comprehensive model of the governance of innovation processes hinges on the one hand on an organization's long-term orientation, which we argue, is not possible without a consideration of an ethical dimension. On the other hand, the model employs, for the first time, the concept of duality, in order to make the positive coexistence of innovation and ethic analytically visible. Guided by this concept the roots of the ethic within innovation are traced from both natural science forces for change, and cultural pressures operating on members of an organization. We present our Integrated Causal Model of Innovation and propose theoretical relationships that will generate numerous avenues for future research in the field, and help managers to reorient their governance strategies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Business ethics; Corporate governance; Culture; Evolutionary theory; Innovation; Natural science; Values,

However, whether these double standards are necessarily due to the fact that one party is a business company while the other is a consumer was not addressed. The results of our two experimental studies, conducted among 277 (Study 1) and 264 (Study 2) participants from a Western European country by means of an anonymous self-administered online survey, demonstrate that the respondents were not only harsher in their judgments of unethical business (vs. consumer) behavior, but also harsher in their judgments of unethical behavior by prosperous (vs. non-prosperous) consumers and prosperous (vs. non-prosperous) business companies (Study 1). Further, they were also less tolerant of unethical behavior by consumers (vs. one's best friend) and business companies with which they have a less than good (vs. a good) relationship (Study 2). These results indicate that double standards are due to differences in perceived wealth between subjects and in the individual's relationship with subjects. These two factors imply that double standards are not strictly reserved to consumer-business relations, but might also be used in business-business and consumer-consumer relations. Further, these results indicate that companies need to be aware of the fact that good financial figures may backfire as they might lead individuals to be more critical of a company's deceptive practices. Moreover, these findings point to the importance of businesses investing resources-and to keep investing resources-in developing a good relationship with stakeholders as these good relationships lead to stakeholders being less prone to make moral condemnations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Business ethics; Consumer ethics; Double standards; Ethical beliefs; Marketing ethics; Moral hypocrisy; Relationship; Wealth,

This paper supports the idea that there is a crisis of leadership - but interprets it quite differently. Specifically, I argue that the most ethically debilitating crisis is the fact that we look to leadership to solve organisational ethical ills. There is, I argue, a pressing need to conceptualise a business ethics that is not constrained by the straitjacket of official hierarchy - a need to denaturalise 'leadership' as the normal or rightful locus of ethical regulation and renewal in business organisation. To this end, I explore a Levinasian ethico-politics of responsibility and proximity as the basis of an alternative, anti-sovereign, ethics of organisation. © 2012 The Author.",,

The paradoxes of strategic operational optimisation and the antinomies of counter-crisis ethics,2013,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84878298052&partnerID=40&md5=5d61b8849639e7ab3a23a50168340ae0,"For good reasons we often think about ethics and strategy as two opposing categories. But as surfaces in which we see social practices reflected, as abstract planes in which social consciousness resides and which subjectivities reinvent, they share some deep and perhaps uncomfortable similarities. In this paper, we question whether they are irreconcilable categories and, through a discussion of the paradoxes of strategy and the antinomies of ethics, we examine their fraught relationship in current economic responses to the crisis. First, we outline the discursive topographies of strategy and ethics in respect to their abstract relations, and examine their integument in business ethics and strategy in context. Then, we show how there cannot be a simple coexistence of these two categories in organisational practice: one must in fact be subordinate to the other, although this subordination can produce the persistence of the other, even in its negation. Finally, we conclude that the asymmetrical nature of ethics and strategy entails that whereas ethics can immanently give rise to strategy, strategic questions on their own can only produce anti-systemic ethical responses. © 2012 The Authors.",,

The stable functioning of socio-economic systems and their strategic competitiveness may be provided within both temporal and spatial aspects thereof by their dynamic development in accordance with the synergistic system-integrated approach. To achieve this goal and to ensure the development of socio-economic systems, a new approach toward theoretical- methodological regulations may be required. Purpose. 1. To evaluate the current state of scientific approaches toward building efficient systems of socio-economic development. 2. To identify relevant problems and formulate the author's own vision of a new paradigm of methodological principles to promote the organizational development. Methods. According to the purpose having been set, the following methods have been used: dialectical, system-integrated, monographic and abstract logical ones. Results. The author examines the development of socio-economic systems within the context of a comprehensive human-oriented plan, with the improvement of humans' well-being as a principal goal. Proceeding from the understanding of the scientists' viewpoints on the nature of the ""development"" concept, the author drew the conclusion that this interpretation is incomplete. The author proposed her own conceptualization of the essence of the latter notion. The development of socio-economic systems should be considered as a temporally constant yet progressively varying process of organizational and managerial change aimed at improving humans' quality of life and organizational units' efficiency based on the balanced and synergistic approach toward ecological, social and economic factors' development. Ecological factor should be considered as the main condition of human life. The economic component should be viewed as a functional-providing factor of human development implementing itself by promoting a healthy environmental and social climate of the main subject of nature. In this context it is worthwhile to view social development as an organic unity of environmental, social, human and economic development. This approach is a primary methodological basis for the conceptualization of general socio-economic groups' development management within the following areas: at the strategic, innovative, institutional, and macro-economic level of national economy; within regional-level administrative units (at the district and regional levels); for territorial and business entities of different ownership regimes. The efficient development at all hierarchical levels will be determined by their balance and harmony rate. The systems of social, social labor, proprietary, relations require a harmonized and balanced development.This can be achieved by establishing a balanced relationship between centralization and decentralization, by developing at all levels of the management system: via macro and micro level intergovernmental regulation at the level of the national economy and regional self-development at the level of the administrative units; under the supervision of respective interregional bodies and regional institutions. The qualitative changes have to occur in the interrelationship between regulation and selfregulation in agricultural companies as well. However, it should be noted that the large-scale forced privatization has exacerbated this problem. The workforce has been distanced from the governance and management processes, which makes the utilization of employees' intellectual potential rather incomplete. The main issue here is the relationship between the state and the business, the village community and the business. The management of organizational change has its peculiarities and depends on: types and directions of development; organizational patterns; behaviour and reaction patterns; reorganization - restructuring and integration - diversification processes; patterns of entrepreneurial and organizational culture. Within the course of efficient development management of competitively oriented socio-economic systems, one should take account of the comprehensive theoretical-methodological principles of general economic theory, development theory, the systems theory, as well as those of some locally functional theory: the innovative development theory, the competition theory, the strategic development theory, the behaviour systems theory, the management theory, the organizational development theory, the theory of organization's interactions, the value theory, the business ethics theory, the self-regulation theory, etc. This approach may provide a basis for general development of socio-economic systems based on harmonious combination of public, regional, entrepreneurial, and personal interests. Conclusion.One should consider a general process of organic unity of economic, social, environmental and human development aimed at living standards' increase as the primary methodological basis for the formation of efficient development management for competitively oriented socio-economic systems. The priority of a human being as the main subject of nature with its civilized interests should be the main guideline for determining the directions of competitively oriented socio-economic systems and their management's evaluation. The development of competitively oriented socio-economic systems can be guaranteed via an integrated approach using both the theoretical- methodological framework and locally-functional economic theories within a single framework. The main directions of the development of the socio-economic entities in their integrity should encompass an organic unity of macroeconomic, regional, territorial, industrial, economic structures and functional hierarchical levels. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2013.",Competitiveness; Development synergy; People; Systems,

This article delves into the ethics of apologies offered by chief executive officers (CEOs). It examines ways in which public apologies on the part of a representative (CEO) of a corporate body (the firm) differ from both private, interpersonal apologies, on the one hand, and nation-state/collective apologies, on the other. The article then seeks to ground ethically desirable elements of a corporate apology in the nature or essence of the corporate apology itself. It explores the largely ignored roles played by the speaker's ethos and audience pathos in genuine or ethical apologies and suggests that attention needs to be paid to the problems posed by ""role contamination,"" context, and other overlooked factors. The reception by the actual audience of a given apology is a highly contingent matter. Ethicists should concentrate, therefore, on what makes a proffered apology, in principle, trustworthy and not merely efficacious for a given audience. ©2013 Business Ethics Quarterly.",Apologies; CEO; Ethos; Logos; Pathos; Role contamination,

Relevance of this research is proven with the fact that social control is an integral and vital component of a society's comprehension. Recently has become actual scientific research of nature, content and forms of social control. The scholars study legal, economic, social and ethical aspects of control as a social phenomenon due to the fact that social relationships are a key component of the economics at all levels. However, the mechanism of economic systems' social control at different levels is ineffective. Therefore, a study of the philosophical foundations of social control in the field of management as an element of such a mechanism is needed. Purpose of the article is to analyze the views of scholars from different branches of science concerning the nature, content and single units of the conceptual apparatus of social control, to show its importance in the economic relations of individuals and social groups, and also to justify such philosophical foundations of social control as its nature, subject, object and form in the economic branch. Results. It has been recognized that the social control in management field is indispensable element of the social mechanism of economic systems' development at all levels of the economy; its realization forms in the field of management have been defined, as well as the results of the realization - granting of the economic and legal assessment of economic behavior which is taken over management solutions in the field of management.",Economic behavior; Results of social control; Social and economic norms; Social control in economics,

Design/methodology/approach – Given the few contributions existing on the topic, and the lack of a general theory, a multiple case-study analysis seems appropriate to the topic. In particular, we present five case studies of European large firms, which have successfully internationalized in SMCs and MECs. In each firm, we interviewed local and foreign managers, in order to understand the importance of cultural issues and the ways companies overcame cultural distance. Findings – Cultural distance is a big problem for European firms investing in SMCs and MECs. They impact both intra- and inter-organizational relationships and cultural bridges can be useful to overcome the effects of its perception. Cultural bridges are effective if based on managers’ cultural competencies, and can be represented by a specific manager, or by an organizational unit. In any case, the involvement of local people and the adaptation to local customs are crucial. Research limitations/implications – The analysis is still limited, and, in the future, we’ll look for a methodology able to isolate cultural knowledge and cultural competence as key factors in order to evaluate the importance of each factor. Practical implications – When entering Islamic countries, foreign investors should be aware of local values, particularly religious and family value, which deeply impact on business and social relationships. Based on a deep cultural knowledge, cultural bridges enable fruitful relationships both inside and outside the organization. Originality/value – Whereas cultural competence is often mentioned in the literature, only a few contributions focus on cultural competence as a key aspect of internationalization. In addition we explore the concept and the relevance of cultural bridges, and the multiple case-study analysis show some best practices firms could follow to succeed in SMCs and MECs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Cultural bridge; Cultural competence; Cultural knowledge; Internationalization; Islam,

Kepner (1995) revealed that traumatic preschool childhood experiences coexisted with existing traumatic environments, while observing it from the viewpoint of development; preschool children's physical, mental and learning capabilities were completely affected. The primary system in the preschool childhood trauma cases was self-enclosed, supportless and helpless; thereby, they might find themself living in constant states of loneliness and hopelessness (Martin, 2009). If preschool childhood trauma was maintained over a considerable period, it could affect the personal development and self-functions as well as social relationships. The cases of preschool children abuse are getting more and more due to the reasons of parental separations, bereavements, skipped-generation educations, witnessing acts of domestic violence; and in general, these preschool children desire to be loved, therefore, these traumatized preschool children will exhibit various degrees of life adjustment problems in different ways, and some of them may eager to show off their abilities, try to please others, and some are very quiet or cringe in front of others, some are very unstable, and some have aggressive tendencies, or have a lower level of learning motivation, or even, some are inveterate liars, etc. (McConnell, 2002). The expressive arts therapy group introduced in this study aimed at older students of kindergartens affiliated to the elementary schools who belonged to emotionally traumatized preschool children with selective mutism and facing life adjustment problems. Thereby, all participants were asked to take part in 50-minute sessions of using expressive art media once a week for 10 weeks (10 unit activities in total). This study mainly aimed to explore the effectiveness of changes in the emotionally traumatized preschool children with selective mutism from high-risk families to participate in the expressive arts therapy group, particularly, the changes in their behaviors and emotions, and life adjustments. This study used the self-created ""Preschool Children's Emotional Life Adjustment Scale"" to assess the performance of emotionally traumatized preschool children with selective mutism and had poor social life adjustments before and after the participation in the expressive arts therapy group; and wherein, class teachers were asked to assist the assessments in order to understand whether these traumatized preschool children had any improvement in life adjustments. In this study, the ""Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS)"" revised by Yang, Zong-Ren (2001) and asked class teachers to assess the improvement of every preschool child's behavior and emotion, and life adjustment. When these traumatized preschool children were participating in expressive arts therapy group to engage in artistic creations, in which, observing the creative process was a therapeutic tool, and moreover, the creation itself could often disclose new issues, and therefore, enhance preschool children's responsibility and interests of participation in these group; during the creative process, the preschool children's thinking would become more flexible (Rose, 2007). The changes in the process emphasized in this study meant the changes in behaviors of these traumatized preschool children conducted in the group in the process of engagement in the expressive arts therapy group.",High-risk families; Life adjustment; Loneliness and hopelessness; Skipped-generation education families,

Both the companies and farmer signed a contract in advance that established the terms and conditions related to the number and quality of products the farmers were going to produce and sell to the companies. However, this contract farming yielded an inequity between the companies and the farmers as companies had an advantage over the farmers due to the fact that they controlled the production systems and markets.

However, ethical theories and perspectives from these different systems are rarely discussed in relation to each other, even though in practice these systems constantly interact. This paper explores ethical theories and perspectives that may apply to the WDP-RTW field, and discusses these in relation to perspectives attributed to dominant stakeholders in this field, and to potential differences in different jurisdictional contexts. Literature was sought primarily in biomedical ethics, business ethics, and public administration ethics. In biomedical ethics, four ethical principles are dominant: autonomy, beneficence, nonmalevolence, and justice. Business ethics involve theories on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), social contracts, and organizational justice. Public administration ethics focus on constitutional theory, citizenship, social equity, virtue, and public interest. Several concepts were identified as relevant for ethical analyses in the WDP-RTW field, including justice; individual autonomy; nonmalevolence; economic and social responsibility; and social contracts. These concepts provide a vocabulary that may be used to analyze stakeholders' actions and interactions in RTW processes. It was also noted how the power balance between stakeholders will influence which ethical perspectives will influence RTW. Jurisdictional differences that influence RTW processes with regard to stakeholder responsibilities were identified, as well as varying beliefs as to who is the client in different compensation systems.

Results suggest that there is little awareness and a lack of understanding and support amongst recreational boaters with regards to the role of MCZs. The MCZ Project was set up in 2009 in order to work with sea users and interest groups to make site recommendations. Many participants in this research stated that the MCZ Project has: taken an unbalanced approach, represents overregulation, and poses a threat to safe anchorages. It is apparent that compliance and support for management tools being employed will be achieved only if the process is transparent and inclusive. An appropriate and equitable mechanism must be developed in order to move beyond 'public consultation' to ensure stakeholders are more fully engaged in both the implementation and management of MCZs.

Management agencies must strike a balance between their capacity constraints and the requisites of management measures. Most small-scale sea cucumber fisheries of Pacific Islands have been plundered while others are being opened to commercial exploitation. Data from fishery managers and a regional workshop were used to assess the current problems, institutional constraints and solutions to the management of sea cucumber fisheries in 13 Pacific Island countries (PICs). Technical capacity was often strong for some management actions such as developing marine reserves but weak for others, such as enforcement. Using multi-disciplinary indicators, half of the fisheries were diagnosed by their managers as being overfished or depleted, despite evidence of optimistic bias. Fishery governance varied greatly among the PICs, and co-management frameworks were not typical of any cultural region. Management objectives were prioritised differently among managers but most highly ranked was to protect ecological resilience. The fishery managers proposed different sets of regulatory measures and various management actions, such as surveys to collect socio-economic and fishery-dependent data, support for local governance and strong enforcement - all widely under-practised. Pacific sea cucumber fisheries exemplify how the transition to an EAF by management institutions must involve reorganisation of their technical and human-resource capacities among management tasks. Levies on exports need to be internalised to fund improved management. Management agencies should consider a shift in resources from developing marine reserves, conducting underwater surveys and aquaculture-based restocking to strengthening enforcement capacity, stakeholder involvement and communication with fishers. In concert with these actions, short fishing seasons, shortlists of allowable species and tighter enforcement at export points may serve to turn the tide on boom-and-bust exploitation and safeguard biodiversity. © 2013 The Authors.",Coastal; Coral reef; Fishery governance; Invertebrate; Overfishing; Small-scale fisheries,biodiversity; comanagement; coral reef; echinoderm fishery; ecosystem approach; fishery management; governance approach; marine ecosystem; marine park; overfishing; stakeholder; Pacific islands; Anthozoa; Holothuroidea; Invertebrata

We hypothesized and found that empathetic managers were less likely to comply with requests by an authority figure to cut the wages of their employees than were non-empathetic managers. However, when an authority figure requested to hold wages constant, empathy did not affect wage cut decisions. These findings imply that empathy can serve as a safeguard for ethical decision making in organizations during trying times without generally undermining organizational effectiveness.

However, scientific knowledge about the role that morality, ethics, and values play in this issue is still scarce. Starting from this research gap, we focus on corporations as central decision makers in modern society and analyze how they respond to societal demands to take responsibility for climate change. While relevant literature on business ethics and climate change either places a high premium on morality or presents a strong skeptical bias, our sociological model depicts morality as an indeterminate force: it can lead to both workable solutions or merely reinforce the status quo, depending on what different corporations make of it. We describe, on the one side, the diffusion of moral values in the media discourse on climate change and, on the other side, the specific responses of corporations. While the media discourse generates a pressure on corporations to act responsibly, their moral claims do not provide clear advice for action. As a result, morality becomes available to organizations as a medium that can be re-specified according to their internal dynamics. Corporations transform moral values into something compatible with their own structures through a variety of different responses: introducing formal ethical structures (e.g., codes of conduct), initiating value-oriented projects, or developing informal moral norms, and so on. In some occurrences, morality becomes a mere façade, while in others it serves as a decision-making criterion and deeply influences core activities in firms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Climate change; Decision making; Mass media; Morality; Organizations,

A review of the extensive literature in this field reveals that the conceptualisation of corporate approaches to responsible stakeholder management remains underdeveloped. In particular, CSR practices within the specific context of the pharmaceutical industry, a sector which particularly dramatically depicts the stakeholder management dilemmas faced by business managers, has been under-researched. To address this gap, this paper utilises qualitative, exploratory data, obtained via multiple research methods, to investigate the CSR practices of major pharmaceutical companies in the UK and Germany. The data are employed to critically re-examine and revise a previously published explanatory framework which identifies the management steps involved in CSR stakeholder engagement. The resulting revised explanatory framework is the main contribution of this paper. By abstracting those factors which influence CSR practice, it provides an analytical tool which is designed to be of practical use for business decision-makers when managing their stakeholder engagement activities. Given that the research addresses values and ideals and prescribes practical recommendations for practitioners, it is essentially applied and normative in nature. Ultimately, the framework proposes a set of steps for developing CSR strategies which could help CSR professionals to make a ‘mindset transition’ from a narrower ‘traditional’ approach to CSR to a more innovative way of thinking. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Conceptual frameworks; CSR; Pharmaceutical industry; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder management; UK and Germany,

We explore whether excellence in corporate social performance affects investors' judgments of financial assessments (i.e., future profitability, liquidity, and financial risk) and credibility of management's forecasts. We define ""excellence in corporate social performance"" as the case of a firm simultaneously showing high and stable social performance and being provided with professional assurance on social activity reporting. We design a 2 × 2 experimental design with two control groups by manipulating corporate social performance (high versus low) and assurance (present versus absent), in which investors are asked to provide their judgments on the financial status of the firm. Our results indicate that corporate social performance excellence has an impact on both investors' financial assessments and their reliance on management-forecasted information. Additional analysis shows that corporate social performance excellence is perceived as having a significantly higher impact on investors' financial assessments and their credibility of managers' forecasts in comparison with temporary corporate social performance. Therefore, we find support for the argument that only the combination of superior and stable corporate social performance and reliable corporate social responsibility disclosure pays off. © 2014 Korean Securities Association.",Assurance services; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Forecasts; Investors,

The influence of CSP on employee outcomes such as organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) has thus been similarly neglected. This paper seeks to investigate these missing links in literature using data collected from a sample of 700 employees in China. The findings demonstrate that HPWS is positively related to HPWS satisfaction and employees' perceptions of CSP. HPWS satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between HPWS and employees' affective commitment (AC). There are multiple mediators between HPWS and OCB, indicating more complicated mechanisms through which HPWS leads to desired HR outcomes. Employees' perceived CSP has a significant influence on HPWS satisfaction, AC and OCB, suggesting firms should place a premium on achieving a reputation as being socially responsible. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",China; Corporate social performance; Employee outcomes; HPWS; HPWS satisfaction,

Using data of listed companies in China, this paper examines whether CSR behavior in the form of charitable donations garners a positive reaction from suppliers. Results derived from both level and change model regressions show that superior CSP makes it easier for a firm to obtain trade credit from suppliers, although the effect is significant only in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). The results are robust to various measures of CSP and endogeneity tests. The results support the strategic philanthropy view and apply stakeholder theory in supply chain, that strategic CSR can help firms to attract suppliers and consolidate cooperative relationships with them, which in turn benefits the firms in terms of more trade credit financing from suppliers. This paper also shows that state-owned enterprises and non-SOEs have different CSR intentions and use CSR to achieve strategic goals in different ways.

From this perspective, this study seeks to verify, with reference to the Italian Mutual Banks, whether the intensity of Social Disclosure (SD) is indeed representative of social responsibility. The aim is therefore twofold: on the one hand, the intention is to estimate the intensity of SD by measuring the extent to which the social reports of a sample of 57 mutual banks comply with GRI guidelines; and on the other, to test the relationship between social-environmental and financial performance and the intensity of SD. The analysis shows that SD intensity is closely linked to the quality of social reports. Some categories, such as corporate identity, membership and community, exhibit high levels of disclosure whilst for other categories, like the environment, there is a lack of a coherent and unitary plan. Moreover, the degree of SD intensity does not appear to be completely represented into actual social-environmental performance and this confirms the shortcomings of the use of SD as a proxy for Corporate Social Performance.",,

It will be argued that the greatest challenge for companies willing to carry out their human rights responsibilities is the great complexity of the issues involved. For instance, while the business activities of companies can impact human rights in numerous, often interconnected ways, the scope of company responsibility, both legally and with regard to stakeholders' expectations, has so far not been defined precisely. This article therefore, seeks to make a contribution in this regard. The rationale being that companies are likely to face increasing expectations, pressures, and incentives for enhanced due diligence on human rights.

In this paper, we focus on the individual level of CSP, manifested in the managerial discretion of a firm's principles, processes, and policies regarding social responsibilities. Specifically, we address the human resources management of employees as a way of promoting CSR values and producing socially minded outcomes. We show that applying the humanist philosophy to the managerial discretion of a business organization leads to the creation of an ""autonomy supportive work environment""-as defined by the self-determination theory-which in turn, facilitates the internalization of social values, citizenship behaviors, and cooperation. The objective of promoting self-determination at work (i.e., the core of a humanist management) fits well with the ontology of social responsibility since autonomy and consideration of individuals as moral actors are central tenets. Furthermore, we show that applying humanistic management philosophy to the discretion of managers can lead to socially responsible outcomes. First, intra-organizational stakeholders (e.g., employees) are treated with respect and focus is put on their well-being, satisfaction, and self-actualization at work. Second, as employees' need of self-determination is addressed by managers, it is likely that pro-social behaviors toward other stakeholders of the organization will be adopted, leading to socially responsible outcomes for extra-organizational stakeholders (Gagné, Motiv Emot 77:58-75, 2003). Thus, this paper ultimately posits that humanistic management applied to the HRM can be a solution for developing and maintaining socially responsible outcomes as determined at the individual level of the CSP model, through managerial discretion. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; HRM; Humanist philosophy; Managerial discretion; Self-determination,

It sheds light on perspectives of how socially responsible business conduct is shaped by consultancies in a national business environment where such an essential aspect of organizational commitment and behavior exhibits comparatively little resonance among companies and is primarily induced by supranational and international policy schemes as well as foreign competitors. Drawing from long interviews with consulting professionals, we explore key topics: the domestic CSR (consulting) industry's characteristics, issues pertaining to the engagement with clients, the endorsement of CSR standards and initiatives, along with the consultants' perspective on institutional dynamics and their prospects with respect to the future of CSR in Greece. In this context, we aim to indicate trends on CSR implementation, pressures exerted on consultants, and managerial attitudes towards corporate responsibility. Our findings illustrate an oligopolistically structured market that encourages consultancies to compete intensely, the consultants' limited capacity to influence the business behavior of their clients, with the latter to adopt a promotional communicative approach to CSR, as well as a lack of institutional coordination and mechanisms that will materially embed social responsibility in the strategic management of business. © 2014 The Authors.

To date, however, little academic research has investigated how knowledge of police performance impacts citizens' trust. We address this long-standing lacuna by exploring citizens' trust before and after exposure to real performance data in the context of a British police force. The results reveal that being informed of performance data affects citizens' trust significantly. Furthermore, direction and degree of change in trust are related to variations across the different elements of the reported performance criteria. Interestingly, the volatility of citizens' trust is related to initial performance perceptions (such that citizens with low initial perceptions of police performance react more significantly to evidence of both good and bad performance than citizens with high initial perceptions), and citizens' intentions to support the police do not always correlate with their cognitive and affective trust towards the police. In discussing our findings, we explore the implications of how being transparent with performance data can both hinder and be helpful in developing citizens' trust towards a public organisation such as the police. From our study, we pose a number of ethical challenges that practitioners face when deciding what data to highlight, to whom, and for what purpose. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate responsibility; New public management; Performance; Public sector; Stakeholder relationships; Transparency; Trust,

Our study explores discursive meaning negotiation surrounding the concepts of environment and sustainability within business discourse. The study is based on qualitative interpretive research drawing from symbolic interactionism (Blumer, Symbolic interactionism: perspective and method.

Data from semi-structured intensive interviews of a small sample of senior corporate managers was analyzed to examine how corporate elites in India frame their approach to sustainability issues and respond to external pressures for deeper corporate responsibility.

The conceptual frameworks of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and stakeholder relationships frequently present the initiation of a dialogue with stakeholders as a way for an organization to respond to criticisms of its social and environmental policies and actions. The paper discusses dialogue in the stakeholder and CSR literature. This is followed by the analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews in the empirical section. Theoretical discussion and empirical examples demonstrate that the role of stakeholder dialogue in implementing CSR strategy is crucial in many ways.

We measure the level of CSD in annual reports using a disclosure instrument based on the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development report ""Guidance on Corporate Responsibility Indicators in Annual Reports"". We find that IFRS adoption had a differential effect on CSD based on a firm's institutional setting i.e., the stakeholder-management relationship prevalent in their institutional environment. Firms in the stakeholder countries did not have a significant change in the level of CSD following the mandatory adoption of IFRS while firms from the shareholder countries experienced a significant increase over the same period resulting in shareholder countries providing an overall higher level of CSD after IFRS adoption than stakeholder countries.

With the decline of the modern welfare state since the late 1970s, social activities of business firms are increasingly regarded as an important complement to or even as a substitute for welfare state policies by a part of the literature. However, and controversially, another stream of argumentation regards these activities as being aimed at advancing the reach of market forces. To fully grasp the ambiguous nature of the social activities of business, in this paper I provide an account of affirmative as well as of critical interpretations of these activities throughout the history of modern capitalism. On this basis, the power of critique to disentangle the diverse motivations that underlie the social engagement of business is highlighted as a condition for facilitating a role of business in society that balances economic and social considerations. © 2014 The Author.

This article explores four illustrative cases from the Netherlands, where several multinationals started to pioneer with sustainable bonuses in the past few years. The article examines the setups and the different elements of bonus programmes used, in terms of performance criteria (focusing in particular on external vs. internal benchmarking), their link to specific stakeholders, type and size of bonuses, target levels and transparency. While sustainable bonuses signal corporate awareness of responsibility vis-à-vis society and stakeholders, credibility varies considerably depending on these elements. Our case evidence sheds some light on the extent to which sustainable bonuses may be a credible sign of corporate responsibility or rather just another perverse mechanism meant to keep up bonus levels (window dressing). A definite assessment is hampered by the emergent state and lack of full transparency-while 'justified' by companies for competitive reasons, this raises questions.

Human praxis will result, but only when sufficiently powerful interests are motivated to act. This paper aims to examine the role that the accreditation of business schools can play in increasing institutional contradictions and hence fostering organisational change towards stakeholder engagement and engagement with social responsibility and sustainability issues. Numerous accreditations are promulgated within the higher education and business school contexts and a number of these relate to, or have aspects that relate to, ethics, social responsibility and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The paper first analyses the take up of accreditations across UK business schools and then uses a case study to illustrate and explore stakeholder engagement and changes related to ethics, social responsibility and sustainability linked to accreditation processes. Findings: Accreditations are found to be an increasingly common interest for UK business schools. Further, a number of these accreditations have evolved to incorporate issues related to ethics, social responsibility and sustainability that may cause institutional contradictions and may, therefore, have the potential to foster organisational change. Accreditation alone, however, is not sufficient and the authors find that sufficiently powerful interests need to be motivated to act and enable human praxis to affect change. Research limitations/implications: This paper draws on previous research that considers the role of accreditation in fostering change that has also been carried out in healthcare organisations, public and professional bodies. Its findings stem from an individual case study and as such further research is required to explore whether these findings can be extended and apply more generally in business schools and universities in different contexts. Practical implications: This paper concludes by recommending that the newly established UK & Ireland Chapter of PRME encourages and supports signatory schools to further embed ethics, social responsibility and sustainability into all aspects of university life in the UK. This also provides an opportunity to engage with the accrediting bodies in order to further support the inclusion of stakeholder engagement and issues related to this agenda in their processes. Originality/value: This paper contributes by introducing accreditation as an institutional pressure that may lead indirectly to organisational change and supports this with new evidence from an illustrative case study. Further, it draws on the role of institutional contradictions and human praxis that engender organisational change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Accreditation; Ethics; Neo-institutional theory; Responsibility; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability,

Taking the ideas of Matten and Crane one step further, we argue that the status of corporations as citizens is not solely defined by their factual engagement in the provision of citizenship rights to others. By analysing political and sociological citizenship theories, we show that such engagement is more adequately explained by a change in the self-conception of corporate citizens from corporate bourgeois to corporate citoyens. While the corporate bourgeois acts primarily for private business purposes, the corporate citoyen engages in society, performing civil and political rights and duties. As an intermediate actor in society, shaped by the principle of subsidiary task-sharing, the corporate citoyen undertakes co-responsibility for social and civic affairs and actively collaborates with fellow citizens below, beside and beyond governmental regulation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Bourgeois; Citoyen; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Responsibility; Social doctrine; Subsidiarity,

Knowledge has become the most important asset of modern businesses, and this study argues that business ethics is associated with the development of intangible knowledge resources-intellectual capital. Businesses with ethical values at the core reinforce ethical conducts and successfully build trust with their various stakeholders, leading to the formation of an ethical and trustworthy corporate culture and a positive corporate environment. Thus, in this reasoning, an ethical approach to business can encourage open communication, problems solving, knowledge sharing and creativity among employees to increase organisational capital; enhance interactions and relationships with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders to increase social capital; attract and retain good talent to increase human capital. Questionnaire survey is adopted as the research method with businesses in the electronic and information technology industries in Taiwan as sample. The results suggest that business ethics is associated with increased intellectual capital. Thus, this study demonstrates that the development of intellectual capital is in line with strengthened ethics. It contributes to the literature through combining research on business ethics with intellectual capital theories and extends the extant intellectual capital literature. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Business ethics; Competitive advantage; Corporate ethical values; High technology industry; Intellectual capital,

This concern has generated various interdiscursive notions, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate citizenship, the stakeholder concept, and sustainable development (SD), that purport to enable managers to manage business in a 'responsible' or 'sustainable' manner. This discursive landscape now commonly includes 'social licence' or 'social licence to operate', a term that has gained greatest currency in the minerals industry. Literature on social licence is sparse, but encapsulates a diversity of notions such as demands and expectations, legitimacy, credibility, and trust, and free, prior and informed consent. Perhaps most fundamentally, the concept of social licence suggests that stakeholders may threaten a company's legitimacy and ability to operate through boycotts, picketing, or legal challenges. Yet this interpretation of legitimacy does not mean that stakeholders have the same capacity as regulators to grant or withhold an operation's right to exist. How, then, do managers within companies under these pressures themselves understand social licence? We present findings of interviews with 16 managers in the minerals industry in Australia. We explore how these managers conceptualise social licence in relation to notions such as legitimacy, approval, and consent, how they interpret processes of social licence in practice, and how they differentiate it from concepts such as CSR. Managers' conceptualisations can be categorised into four broad themes: legitimacy; localisation; process and continuum; and manageability. These findings suggest that, while social licence potentially represents a shift in power relations, this shift is constrained by discursive pressures to legitimise mining operations, to restrict social licence issues to the local level, to minimise regulatory impositions, to marginalise dissent, and to manage reputation. Opportunities for strengthening and adapting current understandings of social licence are considered. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Community relations; Corporate social responsibility; Legitimacy; Mining; Organisational discourse,Environmental impact; Management; Managers; Mining; Public relations; Community relations; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Legitimacy; Minerals industry; Mining operations; Organisational; Social and environmental impact; Economic and social effects; conceptual framework; environmental impact; mining industry; resource development; resource management; stakeholder; sustainable development

A web content analysis and non-parametric mean comparison statistics of the curricula of undergraduate degrees in all universities in Spain were conducted. The main conclusion of this paper is related to the Bologna effect in Spanish universities. Comparing our results with prior research in this matter, it is demonstrated that the main reason that explains the increase of CSR and ethical education in Spain is the Bologna process and its adaptation to the European Higher Education Area. Also, private universities in Spain are more likely to require an ethics course than public universities.

Building on strategic choice theory, we propose that both BE and CSR become more important in enhancing business success when the perceived MD is heightened. Our analysis of 300 firms operating in China statistically confirms our hypotheses: first, under high MD, firms' engagement in CSR results in higher corporate legitimacy and competitive advantage, and second, their adherence to ethical business codes leads to higher corporate legitimacy.

In light of these benefits to employees and their organizations, organizational scholars are increasingly interested in understanding the factors that contribute to meaningful work, such as the design of jobs, interpersonal relationships, and organizational missions and cultures. In a separate line of inquiry, scholars of business ethics have examined meaningful work as a moral issue concerning the management of others and ourselves, exploring whether there are definable characteristics of meaningful work to which we have moral rights, and whether there are moral duties to ourselves and others to fulfill those rights.

Integrative social contracts theory holds an intermediate position between ethical universalist and relativist positions - recognizing universal hypernorms on the one hand and moral free space on the other. We argue that all businesses share a common objective of sustaining long-run economic value for their stakeholders. We develop this argument using an evolutionary logic into a hypernorm along three propositions: First, the firm influences, and is influenced by, members of the society (social context proposition). Second, managers maximize profit subject to joint constraints of technical feasibility and ethical norms (managerial decision proposition). Third, ethical norms evolve from interactions among the stakeholders without a central authority. Natural selection favors norms that maximize long run economic value for the society (natural selection proposition). We show that the hypernorm can spawn widely agreed authentic ethical norms. However, moral bounded rationality when interpreting the hypernorm generates different authentic norms in the moral free space.

This paper aims to address this lack by discussing the role of metatheorising in assessing new approaches to ethics. The approach is illustrated through evaluating a new pedagogy and curriculum for ethics education called Giving Voice to Values (GVV). Our method involves identifying a number of metatheoretical lenses from existing reviews of ethical theories and applying these to examine GVV's conceptual elements. Although GVV has been explicitly presented as a pedagogy and teaching curriculum, we argue that it has the potential to contribute significantly to the development of ethical theory. We discuss the general implications of this metatheoretical method of evaluation for new approaches to business ethics and for GVV and its future development. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Communicative ethics; Giving Voice to Values; Metatheoretical evaluation; Metatheory building; Performative ethics,

We find that significant progress is being made by large listed Australian companies towards integrating sustainability into core business operations. There is evidence of leadership structures being put in place to ensure that board and senior management are involved in sustainability strategy development and are then incentivised to monitor and ensure implementation of that strategy through financial rewards. There is evidence of a willingness to engage and communicate clearly the results of these strategies to interested stakeholders. Overall, there appears to be a developing acceptance amongst large corporations that efforts towards improved corporate sustainability are not only expected but are of value to the business. We suggest that this is evidence of a managerial shift away from an orthodox shareholder primacy understanding of the corporation towards a more enlightened shareholder value approach, often encompassing a stakeholder-orientated view of business strategy.

I contend that even Confucian workers who regularly engage in social rites at the workplace have an internal, Confucian reason to appreciate the value of rights at the workplace. I explain, from a Confucian non-ideal perspective, why I disagree with the presumptuous idea that labor (or workplace) rights are necessarily incompatible with Confucian ideals and values. Specifically, I argue that if managers were ""sages,"" the highest moral exemplars and authorities in the Confucian tradition, they would perceive that social rituals alone are often not a contextually intelligent and valued response for the development of intimate communities in the modern workplace. The sage perspective will lead Confucian managers to realize, from their own moral perspective, that they have good reason to balance rites with rights, so long as the adoption is extrinsically valuable and consistent with the Confucian ideal.

This is especially true for community sport. Community sport is pivotal because community sport organisations can provide opportunities for members to participate actively, thereby enhancing social engagement and community cohesion. The purpose of the study was to identify possible factors and challenges that may influence participation in community sport in Eldorado Park. A qualitative research approach utilising semi-structured interviews was adopted for the study. The sample of the study comprised key community members of Eldorado Park, a suburb south of Johannesburg in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Key members in the context of this study are those individuals who played a significant role in uplifting the community through organising and supporting community sport. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants who were resident in the community for at least ten years. An interview schedule, which focused on opportunities and constraints of participating in community sport, was developed for the study. Two researchers who were experienced in qualitative research were requested to pre-test the interview schedule. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were subjected to content analysis with the aim of developing themes emanating from the analysis. The findings from the in depth interviews revealed several factors and challenges associated with participation in community sport in Eldorado Park. Five broad themes, namely facilities, undesirable behaviour, stakeholder involvement, social factors and resources were identified through the analysis of the transcripts. A multilateral intervention involving community members, the municipality and businesses is therefore necessary to attract community members and especially the youth, to participate in community sport. This will be helpful in curbing undesirable risk behaviours in the community such as alcohol, illicit drug abuse and gangsterism. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.",Challenges; Community sport; Eldorado Park; Participation; Social engagement,

This study applies anthropological and legal perspectives to analyze problems related to gender inequality caused by large-scale land acquisitions. It argues that inequalities cannot be resolved by simply changing regulations related to traditional communities' and women's rights and that gender relations and land tenure issues reflect interconnected social arrangements based on historical specificities of traditional communities.

This remark brings into the arena the issue of the impact of patent protection and the lack of generic competition on the fundamental right to have access to medicines provided for in the Constitution of South Africa and recognized in various regional and international human rights instruments and declarations. The right to have access to medicines can be assured if a sustainable supply of affordable medicines can be guaranteed. However, when sustainability of supply can be guaranteed, new medicines are often too expensive for poor people and governments in the developing countries. This paper seeks to investigate the challenge posed by intellectual property, specifically pharmaceutical patents, which human rights activists blame for creating monopolies that keep medicines inaccessible or unaffordable, and which pharmaceutical companies extol as necessary incentive for expensive research and development. The aim is to provide recommendations, on how this challenge that arises when intellectual property (pharmaceutical patents) and human rights converge can be overcome by pharmaceutical companies. The paper concludes that the enjoyment of the fruits of one's intellectual property while at the same time preventing adverse human rights impacts is possible through a stakeholder and human rights oriented corporate governance approach.",Corporate governance; Human rights; Intellectual property; Monopoly; Patents,

However, a mismatch between the perceptions of a company's corporate behavior and a consumer's ethical behavior has scarcely been assessed from the point of view of individual diff erences on the consumer side. The purpose of the current study is to explore individual diff erences (optimistic versus pessimistic attitude towards business) in the use of ethical judgments regarding questionable conduct of a business versus that of a consumer. In other words, we investigate if the consumers who are positively disposed towards business are less critical of unethical corporate than of consumer actions. In our study, we compared the level of optimism with regard to businesses with attitudes towards business ethics (using the Perceived Role of Ethics and Social Responsibility scale (PRESOR) created by Singhapakdi, Vitell, Rallapalli and Kraft (1996)), and the attitudes towards consumer ethics (using the Consumer Ethics Scale (CES) by Vitell and Muncy (1992)). Research results indicate that the individuals having optimistic attitudes towards business are less likely to use double standards when it comes to (un)ethical consumer behavior, compared to (un)ethical corporate actions.

Business ethics is about identifying and implementing values, rules and standards of conduct for guiding morally right behaviour in an organisation’s interaction with its stakeholders. Against this background a quantitative analysis of the ethical practices of 46 companies operating in the Eastern Cape automotive industry was conducted to determine the extent to which ethics-related interventions contributed to establishing and maintaining an ethical organizational environment. A structured online questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data collected was subjected to extensive statistical analyses, including Cronbach Alpha coefficients and item total correlations, and various descriptive statistics were included as a quantitative summary of the data. A constant reference value for the study was also calculated to allow inferences regarding the significance of the tested variables to the study. The results revealed that the organisations in the sample are highly ethical due to the presence of ethics-related interventions, including a code of ethics, committed leadership, adherence to internal and external governance requirements, compliance with legislation and encouragement and disclosure of unethical behaviour. In light of the high number of ethical scandals internationally, this study will add to the empirical body of business ethics research, as it provides organisations with a framework to establish and maintain an ethical business environment. © 2014 University of Pretoria.

Many argue that it was the failure of PT. Lapindo during the drilling process but the verdict of the District Court of South Jakarta decided that it was a natural disaster. Environmental crime provision is stated in The Environmental Management Act 2009 No. 32 but this stipulation does not reduce the number of corporate environmental crimes as there are other factors involved such as enforcement. The protection of people's environmental human rights is also recognized under The Law of 1999 No. 39 on Human Rights. Regrettably, prosecuting corporate environmental crime from the angle of human rights is at a dead-lock due to the fact that the Indonesian Human Rights Court is only authorized to prosecute genocide crimes and crime against humanity.

The first aspect is its target audience used for research - household consumers of electricity, who can be called ""vulnerable"", captive consumers. The second aspect is the specificity of the electricity market. The aim of the research was to study the relationship between corporate social responsibility, instantiated by the quality of services provided by S.C. Electrica S.A. - Electrica Distribution and Supply South Transylvania and the consumers' loyalty towards the company, in case other electricity suppliers emerge. A subsidiary aspect was the generation of a database having an impact on customer retention. We have carried out some quantitative research, based on the survey method, having a sample of 521 household consumers from the Mures County. The study we carried out proves that consumer satisfaction, their degree of satisfaction under different aspects, is a way of gaining their trust on this particular market. Those consumers with a higher degree of trust in the company are more loyal. This will result in reducing migration to another electricity supplier, in the future, when all household consumers become eligible.",Consumer satisfaction; Consumer trust; Corporate social responsibility; Loyalty; The quality of electric power supply services,

The role of non-governmental organisations towards inducing a more responsible behaviour is explored. By drawing on literature and reflecting on documented actions of various multinational corporations, particularly from the extractive sector, we find a commonalty that cuts across the board: a considerable disparity exists between policies, strategies and actions that these organisations display in the interest of their inherent, short-term economic gains. Such gains jeopardize interests of both internal and external stakeholders as well as the environment especially in the developing world. We argue that the disparity in implementation can be linked to weak structural institutions and lack of ethical standards in most developing countries. © 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.",business strategy; corporate social responsibility; developing countries; non-governmental organisations; oil industry,

The effect of the internet could be an increased variance in social adjustment rather than an average improvement or deterioration. Adolescent internet users might be well adjusted, as they report higher levels of social activity and network involvement; however, internet use and social involvement tend to vary according to education, income and age. Therefore other variables need to be investigated in order to determine the extent to which social isolation and behaviour problems are a result of internet use, regardless of any inherently social disposition on the part of the user. It is not the aim of this article to investigate whether socially isolated adolescents were deficient in social skills even before taking up the internet. The purpose is to investigate the extent to which emotional and interpersonal skills are related to internet use. The main relevant argument is that the internet will cut adolescent users off from genuine social relationships and ultimately lead to impoverished participation in social life. Counter-arguments highlight the potential of new media to enhance adolescents’ social lives as it enables them to engage more easily in communication with their peer group. The importance of peers is one feature of adolescence. Adolescents spend a great deal of time with friends and place a high value on these relationships. In order to determine whether internet use does in fact have a negative impact on social adjustment, it is important to understand what emotions are, and what exactly constitutes emotional intelligence. When used responsibly, the internet can be a great place to interact socially. Consequently, this generation requires a unique brand of education that will enable them to realize their personal dreams and serve the society they are a part of. © 2014 Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

With this in mind, we propose a qualitative and example-based approach that endeavors to provide a versatile way for business teachers to incorporate ethics into their general business classes.

An examination of the institutional arrangements at the interface between the mining company and local communities identified power hierarchies and dependencies in the context of a dominant paternalistic environment. The interactions, inter alia, limited social cohesion and intensified the fragility and weakness of community representation, which was further influenced by ethnic hierarchies between the varied community groups; namely, indigenous communities and migrants to the area from different ethnic groups. Moreover, dependencies and nepotism, which may exist at all institutional levels, can create civil society stakeholder representatives who are unrepresentative of the society they are intended to represent. Similarly, a lack of horizontal and vertical trust and reciprocity inherent in Malagasy society engenders a culture of low expectations regarding transparency and accountability, which further catalyses a cycle of nepotism and elite rent-seeking behaviour. On the other hand, leaders retain power with minimal vertical delegation or decentralisation of authority among levels of government and limit opportunities to benefit the elite, perpetuating rent-seeking behaviour within the privileged minority. Within the union movement, pluralism and the associated politicisation of individual unions restrict solidarity, which impacts on the movement's capacity to act as a cohesive body of opinion and opposition. Nevertheless, the unions' drive to improve their social capital has increased expectations of transparency and accountability, resulting in demands for greater engagement in decision-making processes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Good governance; Madagascar; Nationalised large-scale mining; Rent-seeking; Stakeholder engagement; Unions,Industry; Good governances; Large-scale mining; Madagascar; Rent-seeking; Stakeholder engagement; Unions; Transparency; accountability; chromite; civil society; decision making; governance approach; mining industry; rent seeking; social capital; stakeholder; trade union; Madagascar

The purpose of the paper is to operationalise CSR as an application of Ubuntu rather than as a western business tool. Insights are drawn from a quantitative survey that included 246 customers of the South African mobile service provider Vodacom. The findings revealed that most consumers believe that companies are morally obligated to be socially responsible. Furthermore, it was determined that customers view organizations as being part of society and are therefore obligated to contribute as humans would.

Design/methodology/approach – A value approach was applied to develop a model of retrofit activities. A Europe wide stakeholder engagement, consisting of over 50 face-to-face interviews with key informants with energy efficiency retrofit (EER) knowledge and expertise, informed analyses on flows of both tangible and intangible value for commercial EER projects. Findings – Given the need to expand the EER marketplace, the sustainability of EER processes is as important as the sustainability of EER project outcomes. Understanding value creation in retrofit processes is crucial to successfully harnessing the available energy savings potential from the built environment. Practical implications – The increasing importance of externalities, such as carbon, means that previously unaccounted for costs are now being considered in business models. For EER projects, the challenge is to respond to this new business environment, while maintaining adequate value for stakeholders. For commercial property developers, this means a growing impetus to understand the value propositions of other EER stakeholders.

Yet conceptual views on responsible leadership differ in their definitions and theoretical foundations. This study attempts to reconcile these diverse views and uncover the phenomenon from a business leader’s point of view. Based on rational egoism theory, this article proposes a formal mathematical model of responsible leadership that considers different types of incentives for stakeholder engagement. The analyses reveal that monetary and instrumental incentives are neither sufficient nor necessary for business leaders to consider societal and environmental stakeholder needs. Non-monetary and non-instrumental incentives, such as leaders’ values and authenticity, as well as their planning horizons, counterbalance pure monetary and instrumental orientations. The model in this article complements the growing body of research on responsible leadership by reconciling its various conceptual views and providing a foundation for future theory development and testing. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Rational egoism theory; Responsible leadership; Stakeholder–stockholder dichotomy,

However, limited research has been undertaken to examine the relationship between corporate reputation and customer-related behaviours. This paper deals with a study in which the shortened customer-based corporate reputation (CBCR) scale of Walsh et al. (2009) was validated in a study of supermarket customers in a developing country. The findings support only two of the five dimensions of the Walsh et al. scale. These are customer orientation and competitiveness of the firm. None of the original reputation dimensions or items associated with good corporate citizenship, such as good employer and being socially and environmentally responsible, was part of the dimensions that remained after the statistical analyses. Both customer orientation and competitiveness of the firm are strongly associated with important outcome variables such as trust, loyalty, repatronage intention and overall reputation. The findings of this study reiterate the view that great care should be exercised when scales are considered for application in a context not similar to the one where the scale was developed. © Warc 2014 Warc Ltd.",,

Here we extend that work by focusing on the design of social and environmental accounting (SEA) information systems that take pluralism seriously. We theorize the challenges of designing such systems wherein they are expected to address the needs of multiple users with different interests that may emerge from different economic, social, political and/or cultural perspectives, as they relate, for example, to sustainability reporting, ethical investment, participatory development studies and indigenous resource management. Using dialogic engagement, we attempt to move beyond traditional, and often highly constrained, conceptualizations of ""stakeholder engagement"" and propose a framework for undertaking systems design that can facilitate high quality and relevant SEA information systems that meet the needs of a wide range of actual and/or potential users. We provide an example of how the framework might be enacted using a framing methodology. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Accounting information systems; Contentious framing; Pluralism; Polylogic/dialogic accounting; Social and environmental accounting,

While considerable research has been conducted on CSR in developed countries, the extant literature on CSR in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is scant and CSR is seen in terms of philanthropy. This paper aims to examine CSR from a broader perspective and in particular to identify the factors that hinder and promote CSR activities in SSA using the Smit (2009) CSR Value Chain Model. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on data obtained from a survey conducted by GTZ (now GIZ) on factors promoting and hindering CSR in SSA. The study surveyed 85 companies from six countries, namely; South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Namibia. The study essentially examined the internal and external CSR environments of the companies in the participating countries. Findings – The study revealed that there are nine key promoting and hindering factors of CSR for businesses in SSA. These include: leadership and governance, policy framework, project management, monitoring, evaluation and reporting, stakeholder engagement, staff engagement, government, funding and beneficiation. The study recommends a systemic and context-sensitive approach that relies on the potential of organisations and communities to design and implement their own solution within global frameworks in order to further develop CSR in the region. Research limitations/implications – There are a number of limitations in this study. First, this study did not include any informants from the responding organisations’ stakeholder groups, but relied mainly on information obtained from single respondents from organisations. Further research should include responses from other stakeholder groups. Practical implications – To promote or achieve the successful implementation of CSR and broaden its scope within the region beyond its current focus on philanthropy, managers must build bridges with their stakeholders through both formal and informal dialogues and engagement practices. Additionally, firms may enhance and maximise both social and economic value created when managers link their CSR activities to areas that improve firms’ long-term competitive potential by collectively and systematically applying their distinctive strengths to such activities in accordance with the value chain model. Originality/value – The finding in this study is novel and adds an important contribution to the developing CSR literature in the SSA region. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Corporate social responsibility; CSR hindering factors; CSR supporting factors; Philanthropy; Sub-Sahara Africa,

As an alternative, private regulation, developed and administered by companies, industry associations, and nongovernmental organizations, has emerged to safeguard economic, environmental, and social sustainability in producer countries and along the value chain. The academic literature on private regulation in global value chains has grown over the last decade, but currently few major reviews of the research have been undertaken. This paper examines peer-reviewed research in the relevant disciplines published in academic journals up to December 2011. Our goal is to identify and classify the topics and theories in the global value chain literature. We conclude that the number of articles explicitly examining private regulation, in a global value chain context, is relatively small when considering the importance and growth of these chains in the world’s economy. We also conclude that agriculture, forestry, and apparel manufacturing are the most often studied economic sectors; in contrast, other sectors, such as the information, communication and technology, with their complex global value chains, and often problematic environmental and social conditions, are understudied. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate responsibility; Ethical trade; Global value chains; Private regulation; Sustainability,

Following the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in 2010, BP plc. was accused of having set new records in the degree of divergence between its actual operations and what it had been communicating with regard to corporate responsibility. Its legitimacy crisis is here to be appraised as a case study in the discrepancy between symbolic and substantive strategies in corporate greening and its communication. A narrative analysis of BP's ""beyond petroleum""-rebranding and the ""making this right""-campaign issued in response to the Gulf of Mexico disaster discusses their respective implications for (green) corporate change. Further, the question is addressed why BP's green image endeavors were so widely accepted at first, only to find themselves dismissed as corporate greenwashing now. The study concludes that where a corporation's ""green narrative"" consistently evokes established narratives, its legitimacy will be judged against narrative, rather than empirical truth. Thus, the narrative will be more willingly accepted as speaking for the issuing company's legitimacy, irrespective of whether it reflects substantive greening or not. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",BP; Corporate communication; Corporate environmental responsibility; Image crisis; Impression management; Narrative analysis,

One thousand top level managers of Icelandic firms were approached and asked a number of questions aimed at establishing their view on the relationship between ethics education and the role of business schools in forming and developing business ethics education. Icelandic businesses were badly hurt by the 2008 crisis, and therefore Iceland provides an interesting foundation for an empirical study of this sort as the aftermath of the crisis has encouraged managers to consciously reflect on the way their business was and should be conducted. Based on the results of the survey, a few main themes have developed. First, it appears that according to practicing managers, business schools should not be held responsible for employees' unethical behavior. Nevertheless, managers believe that business schools should assist future employees in understanding ethics by including business ethics in teaching curricula. Second, managers believe that the workplace is not where ethics are learned, while also insisting that former students should already have strong ethical standards when entering the workplace. Third, managers call for business schools not only to contribute more to influencing students' ethical standards, but also to reshape the knowledge and capabilities of practicing managers through re-training and continuous education. Based on the results of the study, the article also offers some recommendations on how to begin reformulating the approach to business ethics education in Iceland, and perhaps elsewhere. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Business schools; Ethics; Higher education; Iceland,

The strategy of this paper is to distinguish between a principle of organization that fosters participation (type I democracy) and a principle of legitimation that draws on consent (type II democracy). Based on this distinction, we highlight conceptual shortcomings of the literature on stakeholder democracy. We demonstrate that parts of the literature tend to confound ends with means. Many approaches employ type I democracy notions of participation and often take for granted that this also improves type II democratic legitimation. We hold this to be a mistake. We provide examples of the ambiguity of organizational procedures and show that under some circumstances a decrease in the degree of participation may actually increase legitimation because a governance structure that results in higher productivity can provide higher benefits for all parties involved, serve their interests and therefore meet their agreement. Less type I democracy may mean more type II democracy. We believe this to be an important insight for judging (and further improving) the legitimacy of both capitalistic firms and competitive markets. © 2014 Business Ethics Quarterly.",Consent; Constitutional economics; Democracy; Legitimacy; Participation; Stakeholder theory,

However, beyond offenders and victims, reintegration depends on the views of organizational peers and their desire to interact with these parties. In two studies, we demonstrated that offender amends and victim forgiveness interact to predict peer reintegrative outcomes. We found evidence of backlash against unforgiving victims: Peers wanted to work the least with victims who rejected appropriate amends, thus penalizing them for their failure to contribute to the restoration process. This backlash effect was due to decreased liking of the victim and the perceived failure to repair the offender-victim relationship.

The long tail is a concept defined by Chris Anderson to describe a business model used by the majority of Internet firms and ecommerce stores. Is the long tail model crucial to the news media's competitive market capacity today? The study integrates relevant economic concepts of production costs, distribution costs, search costs, and market performance to construct a long tail economy for online news. Using survey, third-party traffic metrics, and content analysis, this study found that the traffic performance of online news sites was significantly impacted by long tail forces, but the impact had not transferred to the news sites' financial performance. The synthesis provides rich explanations of how the long tail economy can be applied to online news to reveal the forces that both drive and constrain its performance. © Taylor & Francis.",,

I begin by outlining the notion of a practice, before turning to Moore's attempt to provide a MacIntyrean account of corporate governance. I argue that Moore's attempt is mismatched with MacIntyre's account of moral education. Because the notion of practices resists general application I go on to argue that a negative application, which focuses on regulation, is more plausible. Large-scale regulation, usually thought antithetical to MacIntyre's advocacy of small-scale politics, has the potential to facilitate practice-based work and reveals that MacIntyre's own work can be used against his pessimism about the modern order. Furthermore, the conception of regulation I defend can show us how management is more amenable to ethical understanding than MacIntyre's work is often taken to imply. © 2014 Business Ethics Quarterly.",MacIntyre; Management; Practices; Regulation; Virtue-ethics,

The results confirm the multidimensionality of tax evasion attitudes. Idealism was negatively related to self-interest tax evasion attitudes while relativism was positively related to such attitudes. Idealism was also positively related to tax evasion attitudes stemming from concerns about the justice of the tax system. Idealists in a weak tax environment seemingly go through a cognitive reframing process where they recognize that the tax system is unfair, and accordingly tax evasion is a way to serve a different moral absolute, that is of equity, rather than another different moral absolute, which is fulfilling obligations to governments. The results are also explained in light of the suggested low moral intensity of tax evasion among respondents. Policy implications are presented. © 2014 The Authors.

To capture the distinct nature of this global focus, researchers have developed a three-generation CSR typology. In this paper, we first evaluate the usefulness of this typology for understanding corporate approaches to CSR by examining how several companies position themselves thematically in CEO introductions to sustainability reports. On the basis of this, we then evaluate the practical value of this typology for assisting those who work with CSR strategy. The analysis revealed expressions of all three CSR generations, with third-generation thinking being apparent, but not dominant. It also verified that the three-generation CSR typology can be an instructive means of both evaluating as well as framing a company's approach to sustainability, though with modifications.

We discuss a research study to analyze how pressures from internal and external stakeholders of a firm, economic pressures, environmental regulations, and pressures of environmental compliance have affected environmental performance of firms using data collected from manufacturing firms in the United Kingdom. We have found that internal stakeholders provide the greatest impact in shaping environmental performance of firms, closely followed by economic pressures, environmental regulations, and external stakeholders in that order.

While the article identifes an opportunity for this particular approach to reform patriarchal interpretations and practices of Islam toward gender egalitarian interpretations and practices, it also contests the notions of adaptation and well-being inherent within the capability approach.

Moreover, in order to address limited micro-level research in CSR, we develop a measure of employee perceptions of CSR through four pilot studies.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an SRI framework applicable to IFIs and other Shari'a compliant entities and assess its applicability within Shari'a departments of two Islamic banks. This paper involves cross-case analysis based on interviews with Shari'a department officials in two settings differentiated by their respective independence. The proposed framework consists of required, expected and desired SRI aspects as applicable to IFIs. The findings reveal that the required aspects are uniformly observed by the two cases. There are, however, variations when it comes to observing the expected and desired ethical SRI aspects that may be driven by the independence of the Shari'a boards.

My goal is not to defend or reject the economic case for sweatshops. Instead, proceeding from a broadly pluralist understanding of value, I make and defend a number of claims concerning the ethical relevance of economic analysis for values that different agents utilize to evaluate sweatshops. My arguments give special attention to a series of recent articles by Benjamin Powell and Matt Zwolinski, which represent the latest and best defense of the economic case for sweatshops. In the process, I challenge Zwolinski's ""non-worseness claim"" (NWC), and the idea that opposition to sweatshop wages and working conditions fails to respect that the autonomy of would-be sweatshop workers. Ultimately, I conclude that even if the economic case for sweatshops rests on a solid empirical foundation, agents possess good reason to advocate for better wages and working conditions for sweatshop workers, and to prefer less exploitative or coercive relationships. Sweatshop labor undermines a compelling vision of free markets, according to both Kantian and republican conceptions of freedom, and the relationships formed by those who participate in such markets. ©2014 Business Ethics Quarterly.",Background justice; Exploitation; Labor rights; Supply chain ethics; Sweatshops,

Confronted with charges from regulators, several banks, such as Barclays, UBS (originally Union Bank of Switzerland) and the Royal Bank of Scotland, have paid huge fines and settled the matter to avoid criminal prosecution. The scandal raises serious questions of corporate governance, and this article examines the issue from the governance perspective, using Barclays as a case study. Internal failures occurred at several levels in Barclays' reporting of rates. Misreporting was mainly of two varieties - misreporting for personal gain and misreporting encouraged by senior managers, ostensibly in the corporate interests. The article argues that corporate governance systems and structures are powerless in dealing with such fraud or lack of judgment. Misreporting for personal benefit was clearly a breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty of the managers involved. But misreporting, ostensibly to protect corporate interests, is more probably a breach of the emerging fiduciary duty of good faith. The article also points out that the misdeeds occurred in the banks during an era of financial liberalization and permissiveness. In particular, it highlights that the loose structure of interest derivatives and the potential they offered for speculation were important factors in the practices at the banks involved in the LIBOR episode. The article concludes with an analysis of the implications of the LIBOR episode and its consequences for corporate responsibility and accountability as well as public regulation and its efficacy. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",Banks; Conflict of interests; Corporate governance; Fiduciary duties; Financial liberalization; LIBOR scandal,

Determinants of changes in international economic relations which affect formation of ethics and responsibility of the international business were identified. Improvement of the world market agents' rationality should be aimed at forestalling the emergence of new environmental threats and risks to humanity. This process is accompanied by the increasing complexity of the business relations forms between the countries as a result of updating their strategies to achieve progress and competitive advantages in certain effects of globalization, information technology, scientific and technical progress. Understanding of the global ecological security concept has been updated, regardless of each country's economic well-being level, as they all are integrated into the global relationship of responsibility and interaction at different levels of internationalization and construction of the world system's new configuration. Promising and effective diversification of the international business areas provides harmonization of economic and environmental interests of market agents, and the states a priority for social and environmental benefits of society. It is revealed that the criteria for responsibility and environmental security are conditional and changing under the influence of historical, cultural, ethnic, geographic, natural, information and political factors. Socially oriented business, focused on achieving the goals of sustainable development, provides benefits to all market participants through the positive image maximizing in community.

In particular, using firm-level Buddhism data, measured as the number of Buddhist monasteries within a certain radius around Chinese listed firms’ registered addresses, this study provides strong evidence that Buddhism intensity is significantly negatively associated with tunneling. This finding is consistent with the view that Buddhism has important influence on corporate behavior and can serve as a set of social norms and/or an alternative mechanism to mitigate controlling shareholders’ unethical tunneling behavior.

Specifically, we argue in this paper for an expansion of the traditional 'make or buy' decision to include a 'steal' option. Several propositions are offered to suggest that the context in which this act of entrepreneurial piracy occurred could be generalised to other cases of artificial market constraints on valuable resources and includes the features of information compactedness, opportunism, bounded rationality, and strategic deception. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Boundaries of the firm; Bounded rationality; Business ethics; Buy; Entrepreneurial piracy; Ethical decision making; Information compactedness; Legal piracy; Make; Opportunism; Steal; Strategic deception; Strategic planning; Strategy; Uncertainty,

Yet it happens all the time. We fall prey to obstacles that obscure or drown out important signals that things are amiss. Becoming a ""first-class noticer,"" says Max H. Bazerman, a professor at Harvard Business School, requires conscious effort to fight ambiguity, motivated blindness, conflicts of interest, the slippery slope, and efforts of others to mislead us. As a manager, you can develop your noticing skills by acknowledging responsibility when things go wrong rather than blaming external forces beyond your control. Bazerman also advises taking an outsider's view to challenge the status quo. Given the string of ethical failures of corporations around the world in recent years--from BP to GM to JP Morgan Chase--it's clear that leaders not only need to act more responsibly themselves but also must develop keen noticing skills in their employees and across their organizations.",,"article; business ethics; methodology; personnel management; United States; Ethics, Business; Personnel Management; United States"

The problem with managing earnings is it becomes an ethical practice, regardless of who is or may be affected by the practice or the information that flows from it. Previous studies surveyed students and business managers to measure their perceptions about the morality of earnings management actions. This study compares a university in the MENA region with a university in the USA and shows that there is a significant difference between the perceptions of the universities. The accounting student of today becomes the business manager of tomorrow. Therefore, the problem is whether the accounting student's personal values can be changed towards a desired end. Students need more exposure and understanding of earnings management. Accounting educators should aim to assist students to understand how they may react once confronted with an ethical conflict when in practice. Furthermore, accounting courses should include regular reports of fraudulent practices in the media and accounting journals and greater emphasis should be placed in the accounting curricula on ethical earnings management practices.

Previous studies have sought to identify the positive consequences of trust such as loyalty and repurchase, but the question of what builds trust remains largely unanswered. To answer the question, we developed a model that depicts the relationships among transparency, social responsibility, trust, attitude, word-of-mouth (WOM) intention, and purchase intention. An online survey was conducted with a US nationwide sample of 303 consumers, and the data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling method. The results indicated that consumers’ perceptions of a corporation’s efforts to be transparent in the production and labor conditions and to be socially responsible by giving back to the local community directly affected these consumers’ trust and attitudes toward the corporation, and indirectly affected their intentions to purchase from and spread positive WOM about the corporation.

The problem is that this kind of rent and rent seeking, when they fail to deliver desirable outcomes, are better described as government failure. I suggest that this means we will have to expand Heath's framework to a market and government failures approach. I then try to defuse objections that as a government failure, rent seeking may not appear relevant to what managers ought to do. Solving this conceptual issue will also give us an excuse to revisit a separate conceptual issue: the normatively thick conception of ""rent"" and rent seeking behavior that some use. This normatively thick conception is problematic, I argue, and I offer the beginnings of a novel, normatively neutral conception that is useful for our purposes in making the ethics of rent and rent seeking behavior more than a merely trivial exercise. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Beyond-compliance obligations; Business Ethics; Market failure; Market failures approach; Regulation; Rent seeking; Self-regulation; Stakeholder theory,

Over the last decade it has been argued that positive duties also befall commercial agents, at least when confronted with large scale public problems and when governments fail. The argument that enterprises have positive duties is often grounded in the political nature of commercial life. It is argued that agents must sometimes take over governmental responsibilities. The German republican tradition argues along these lines as does Nien-Hé Hsieh. Agents in commercial life are bound by positive duties because at some point they become citizens that must take on the responsibilities of the state. In this paper we leave undisputed the claim that corporations must acknowledge positive duties. However, we demonstrate that the political grounding fails, at least in the sense that this theory insufficiently acknowledges a long standing liberal tradition that vindicates apolitical markets and clear borderlines between politics and economics. We carve out an alternative route to the grounding of one specific positive duty-the duty to further justice. Our argument is based on the moral nature of commercial agents (including corporations) and tries to demonstrate that the duty to further justice ensues from liberalism. Taking a Kantian perspective, it conceptualizes the duty to further justice as a moral duty, orientated toward the political domain. It is grounded in the obligation to attain moral autonomy in the civil condition. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Duty of assistance; Duty to further justice; Kant; Politicization; Republicanism; Ruggie,

Thanks to the recent success of films such as Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds or Academy Awardwinning Benigni's film La vita è bella and Spielberg's Schindler's List it is commonly believed that the Holocaust is a very frequent and popular theme. Nevertheless, this statement is only partly true, especially when it comes to Italian cinema. Soon after the atrocities of the WWII Italian cinema became one of the most prominent and influential thanks to its national film movement, neorealism, characterized by stories set amongst the poor and famished postwar Italy, celebrating the fight for freedom under the banners of Resistance and representing a nation opposed to the Fascist and Nazi regime. Interestingly, these films, in spite of their very important social engagement, didn't even mention the Holocaust or its victims and it wasn't until the 1960's that Italian cinema focused on representing and telling this horrific stories. Nevertheless, these films represented Italians as innocent and incapable of committing cruel acts. The responsibility is usually transferred to the Germans as typically cold and sadistic, absolving Italians of their individual and national guilt.",Good italians; Holocaust; Italian post-war cinema; Myth,

A main question that is also given substantial attention in the business ethics literature-even more so in the wake of the recent financial crisis-is whether increasing levels of executive compensation can be justified from an ethical point of view. Also, the relationship of executive compensation to instances of unethical behavior or outcomes has received considerable attention. The purpose of this paper is to explore the social, ecological, and existential costs of economic incentives, by discussing how relying on increasing levels of executive compensation may have an adverse effect on managerial performance in a broad sense. Specifically, we argue that one-dimensional economic incentives may destroy existential, social, and systemic values that influence the manager's commitment to ensure responsible business conduct, and have negative spillover effects that may reduce the manager's performance. There are well-documented findings that demonstrate that reliance on sources of extrinsic motivation (such as economic incentives) may displace intrinsic motivation. Our perspective is a holistic one, in the sense that we will explore the influence of sources of extrinsic motivation on the manager's intrinsic commitment to different types of values. We will in particular investigate how it may influence the manager's ethical reflection and behavior or lack thereof. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Executive compensation; Holistic perspective; Incentives; Motivation; Value-dimensions of managerial performance,

In this context, the necessity to focus on ethics as a prerequisite in regular decision-making at the level of these organisations represents a major challenge for higher education, in particular for the business administration field, which has to ensure the comprehensibility of these phenomena. The research is divided into three main sections that focus on the ethical dimension of human activities in the economy, starting from the need to integrate ethics into business education: problems and objectives of the curriculum regarding ethics, requirements for elaborating the curriculum, as well as students' perception of the introduction of ""Business Ethics"" in the curriculum. Based on the specialised literature review, the observations at the level of organisations, the analysis and structuring of structural-phenomenological information, we disseminated the objectives and requirements of a curriculum focused on business ethics. The quantitative analysis of students' perception of the discussed issue was made by means of a survey carried out among students enrolled in Master's programmes, based on a questionnaire. The relevant elements were identified to validate the research hypotheses: relevant business factors (profit, risk, financial viability, the need for ethics and the involvement in community problems), the explanatory variables of ethical behaviour (the education, the mission and the value system, the existence of a code of ethics and of a person responsible for ethics-related issues), the requirements of the business environment in education (focus on practical aspects of Business Ethics courses, combining theoretical sessions with practical ones, cooperation with the business environment, the use of case studies as a didactic tool and updating the content of Business Ethics courses), as well as the competitive advantages gained by introducing ""Business Ethics"" in the curriculum (high degree of comprehension, more opportunities, competitiveness, efficiency in fulfilling responsibilities).

Design/methodology/approach – The authors link current debates about integrated reporting to prior research on the contested politics of social and environmental reporting, and critiques of the dominance of business case framings. The authors introduce research from science and technology studies that seeks to broaden out and open up appraisal methods and engagement processes in ways that highlight divergent framings and politically contentious issues, in an effort to develop empowering designs for sustainability. The authors demonstrate the strong resonance between this work and calls for the development of dialogic/polylogic accountings that take pluralism seriously by addressing constituencies and perspectives currently marginalized in mainstream accounting. The authors draw and build on both literatures to critically reflect on the International Integrated Reporting Council’s (IIRC, 2011, 2012a, b, 2013a, b) advocacy of a business case approach to integrated reporting as an innovation that can contribute to sustainability transitions. Findings – The authors argue that integrated reporting, as conceived by the IIRC, provides a very limited and one-sided approach to assessing and reporting on sustainability issues.While the business case framing on which it rests might assist in extending the range of phenomena accounted for in organizational reports, it remains an ideologically closed approach that is more likely to reinforce rather than encourage critical reflection on “business as usual” practices. Recognizing that the meaning and design of integrated reporting are still far from stabilized, the authors also illustrate more enabling possibilities aimed at identifying and engaging diverse socio-political perspectives. Practical implications – Science and technology studies research on the need to broaden out and open up appraisal methods, together with proposals for dialogic/polylogic accountings, facilitates a critical, nuanced discussion of the value of integrated reporting as a change initiative that might foster transitions to more sustainable business practices. Originality/value – The authors link ideas and findings from science and technology studies with literature on dialogic/polylogic accountings to engage current debates around the merits of integrated reporting as a change initiative that can contribute to sustainability. This paper advances understanding of the role of accounting in sustainability transitions in three main ways: first, it takes discussion of accounting change beyond the organizational level, where much professional and academic literature is currently focussed, and extends existing critiques of business case approaches to social and environmental reporting; second, it emphasizes the political and power-laden nature of appraisal processes, dimensions that are under-scrutinized in existing accounting literature; and third, it introduces a novel framework that enables evaluation of individual disclosure initiatives such as integrated reporting without losing sight of the big picture of sustainability challenges. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Dialogic/polylogic accountings; Integrated reporting; Social and environmental accounting; Sustainability,

While a number of studies have attempted to classify ethical attitudes into different categories, more work in this area is needed. This paper reports on a study that examined attitudes towards the acceptability of workplace behaviour that might be considered unethical. Graduate business students at an Australian university (n = 234) were asked to indicate the ethicality of 17 different behaviours, drawn from the business ethics literature. Exploratory factor analysis identified distinct factors, consisting of misuse of company resources, self-serving deceit, and the giving or receiving favours for personal gain. The derived factor structure was then tested with confirmatory factor analysis. Descriptive statistics indicated that misuse was considered less unethical than exchanging favours for personal gain.

Drawing on social learning and identity theories and using data collected from undergraduate business students (n = 318), we found that ethical climate was a significant predictor of unethical behavior, such that students with positive perceptions about their business school's ethical climate were more likely to refrain from unethical behaviors. Moreover, we found that high moral and institutional identities strengthened the effect of ethical climate on unethical behavior. In addition to novel theoretical contributions to the business ethics and socio-psychology literature, this study offers practical pathways through which business schools can nurture and instill the values and behaviors that ultimately help shape positive organizational ethics.

Design/methodology/approach-The paper utilises a visionary road-mapping approach to study the required changes and the business potential related to sustainable development in the manufacturing industry. Findings-The results were summarised in three sub-roadmaps empowerment of stakeholders, increase efficiency and creation of new performance criteria. On the basis of the summary of the sub-roadmaps, the framework was configured to describe the opportunities and challenges of sustainable business development in the European manufacturing industry. Research limitations/implications-A clear implication of this study is that a more system-oriented approach, new models for collaboration between network actors and transparently shared network-level KPIs are required before further steps towards a sustainable manufacturing industry can be taken. In addition, sustainability-driven business models are required to specify these changes concretely. Practical implications-The presented sub-roadmaps and framework summarising them could provide new insights to business practitioners exploring business potential of sustainability. Social implications-Understanding about the road-mapping process as tool that enables interaction and envisioning between different stakeholders could also have social implications supporting shared industry-level learning processes.

Traditionally, corporate governance reform has taken a structural approach, tightening the rules around the number of independent directors required on boards and committees and fine-tuning the definition of independence. However, such an approach has failed to achieve effective corporate governance. Moreover, this approach is informed by the arguably discredited assumption that individuals are rational self-interest utility maximizers. This conceptual paper questions why corporate governance scholars and regulators remain uncritical of this assumption and suggests an approach to reform inspired by a different view of human nature. Indeed, incorporating an actor-based approach to reform into existing structures may better achieve effective corporate governance while addressing an unjustified adherence to this flawed assumption. © 2014 The Authors.

From a business standpoint, social challenges in developing countries differ greatly from those in nations where governments or markets effectively provide for the population's health needs. The case illustrates what led a multinational to set up a corporate foundation and focuses on three strategic and operational dilemmas it ran up against. The case discussion shows that the ethical issues intertwined with these dilemmas are best understood using a variety of ethical approaches.

The mean age and years of work experience of the respondents were 31 and 8.2 years, respectively. The results show, first, that while moral intensity is correlated with whistleblowing intention, only the potential harm is positively correlated with such intention. Second, potential harm and social pressure differentially affect whistleblower choice of using an internal or external channel. Third, organisational commitment has a moderated mediation effect among moral intensity, whistleblowing intention and behaviour.

This article examines whether business practices within a conflict-sensitive region, the island of Cyprus, are consistent with existing business and peace literature and how the specific business practices promote peace. In particular, the article examines in detail two business practices: Green Line Trade and cross-territorial joint ventures and promotions. Our findings suggest that existing business activities in Cyprus are consistent with those proposed by the literature, but their significance in promoting peace was limited. We propose an alternative explanation for why such business practices were pursued in Cyprus at the time, drawing on studies of identity-based conflicts. And we suggest that business has a unique role to play compared with other public institutions when addressing identity conflict. Finally, we suggest that both theoretical and empirical studies of business and peace should include consideration of how business practices might help alleviate identity-related issues in conflict-sensitive regions. © 2014 The Authors.

A plurality of private standards, codes of conduct and quality assurance schemes currently developed particularly, though not exclusively, by TNCs replace traditional intergovernmental regimes in addressing profound global environmental and socio-economic challenges ranging from forest deforestation, fisheries depletion, climate change, to labor and human rights concerns. While this trend has produced a heated debate in science and politics, surprisingly little attention has been paid on the effects of private governance on questions of distribution and justice. This is highly problematic. At the beginning of the twenty-first century global inequalities are greater than ever before, while rapid economic, social, political, and environmental changes threaten to further derail sustainable development and humanitarian objectives. If private governance creates or intensifies some of the pressing global inequalities (e.g., food security), and alleviates others (e.g., environmental degradation), from a business ethics perspective, we need to know which aspects need to be strengthened and where appropriate interventions are necessary and desirable. This paper proposes a framework to examine and classify the distributive outcomes of private governance institutions through the lenses of one particular approach to distributive justice, the capability approach. Empirically, it focuses on agrifood one area where the controversy regarding the distributive concerns of private governance are particularly pronounced. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Agrifood; Capabilities approach; Governance; Private standards; Sustainability,

Based on our data collected from 330 university students in Czech Republic, we provide the following findings. First, our formative models are superior to our reflective models. Second, for the reflective model, money represents Power, Good, Achievement, and not Evil, in the context of materialism. Our formative model suggests that those who pursuit materialism cherish Achievement (vanity) but Budget their money poorly. Third, multi-group analyses illustrate that humanities students (62.4 % female) consider money as Evil and Budget their money poorly, while those in natural sciences (37.6 % female) do not. Further, men are obsessed with Achievement, whereas women do not Budget their money properly, suggesting reflective temptation for males and impulsive temptation for females.

This statement is based on the research conducted by the authors during the last three years on the companies' performance in Romania regarding the results of the innovation process and capitalization on scientific resources in order to improve this vital process. To achieve this, a mechanism should be created, through which key players in the market - companies, universities, research institutes and government - could work together towards the common goal of economic growth. This mechanism would help companies move beyond incremental innovation by using knowledge generated by universities or research institutes. This can be achieved with the support of the governmental environment, by adopting policies and creating a general favourable climate for research and by fostering its integration among companies. This paper presents an analysis of the degree to which companies in Romania use the results of academic research when developing new products or services. Among the identified issues we include the Romanian companies' tendency to perform individual research and development projects, though their frequency is quite low given the difficulties in successfully delivering them to the market. The research shows the importance of using academic research when moving beyond incremental improvements and developing the innovation processes within the company.

We find a positive association between the level and change of CSR engagement and the level and change of analyst coverage after considering simultaneity and causality. Based on the first-difference approach, we further find that the change in analyst following from the previous year affects the change in CSR in the current period, whereas the change in CSR from the previous period does not influence the change in analyst following in the current period. Furthermore, we find that the change in CSR engagement as well as the interaction effect of changes in CSR and analyst coverage reduces the change of firm risk. When we examine the CSR strengths and concerns separately, analyst following does not significantly influence firms' CSR strength but CSR concern activities decreases significantly as firms have more analyst followings. We further find the mediating role of financial analysts between CSR concerns (but not CSR strengths) and firm risk. We maintain that analysts provide indirect but additional social pressure to the firms to eventually reduce their irresponsible activities. Taken together, we interpret these results to support the stakeholder theory-based conflict-resolution explanation that considers CSR engagement as a vehicle to reduce conflicts of interest between managers and noninvesting stakeholders but not the overinvestment hypothesis that views CSR as a waste of valuable resources at the cost of shareholders. © 2014 The Authors.

One of the most prolific cooperation forms was objectified through the online social networks, a catalytic form of interaction that allows individuals to stay constantly connected and to exploit the complex nature of the communication devices and services. Starting from this point, the paper discusses the main forms of similarity which stand for the basis of interaction and communication among the members of Facebook social networks. The proposed approaches to similarity address the mechanisms which encourage the formation and the development of strong online social networks: the similarity as a condition, the similarity as a context, the similarity as a catalyzer, the similarity as a consequence and the similarity as a connection. The configuration of these dimensions in the context of the online social networks was tested by analyzing the case of Facebook online social networks. Each of the five dimensions was marked out from the perspective of a sociological interview-based inquiry conducted with fourteen students from a communication college. With a view to better illustrate certain findings, an online social network analysis was performed. As the preliminary results showed, Facebook, as an online social network, is used by the respondents especially for social searching and bonding social capital rather than social browsing which concerns the initiation of new contacts with unknown individuals in the direct interaction. In fact, the most important function of these communities is to allow members to discover other sources of similarity and to potentiate the similarity discovered in the offline environment through consistent communication and interaction. © 2014 MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.",Facebook; Online Social Networks; Similarity,

At the current stage of the national economic development, moulding and implementation the regional logistics systems (RLS) is one of the most effective ways of economic and social management both in a separate region and in the state in general. However, despite the large number of scientific publications on the selected research topic, scientists investigate only the economic and social aspects of the RLS, without analyzing their eco-destructive impact on the environment. Purpose. To analyze the prerequisites for the formation, operation and development of ecologically-oriented RLS. In order to achieve this goal, the following tasks were addressed: - prerequisites of RLS formation were analysed; - the essence of ecologically-based RLS was discovered; - organizational and economic mechanism of ecologically-based RLS was presented. Results. The authors analyzed the prerequisites for the formation, operation and development of ecologically-oriented regional logistics systems and the necessity of their creation in the regions. The authors' definition of ecologically-based RLS has been presented. Ecologically-oriented RLS is an integrated system of logistics flow processes management, which aims at alignment of the interests, meeting the needs of RLS parties and the eco-destructive influence reduction in the region.

The following measuring instruments (self-report measures) were used: the relationship of mother/father with grandparents, the Perception of Family Interactions Scale, the Friendship Quality Scale, and the Social Loneliness Scale. The results of this study confirm the hypothesis of the intergenerational transmission of parenting. Moreover, they show that the mother's parental style has a stronger effect on friendship quality in female adolescents than the father's parental style. Generally, it should be noted that the results of this research show that the mother’s parental style has a greater impact on friendship quality and social loneliness for girls than for boys. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.",Adolescents; Friendship quality; Intergenerational transmission; Parenting; Social loneliness,

This research investigated the influence of this money-is-all attitude on alienation based on a cross-cultural comparison of Korea, the US and Sweden. The money-is-all attitude was defined as a perspective in which money is regarded as an indicator of achievement or success. Self-administered online surveys were conducted with consumers ranging between the ages of 20 to 49 in Korea, the US and Sweden. The money-is-all attitude and alienation seemed to be more pervasive in Korea than in the US or Sweden. The money-is-all attitude was the factor with the strongest influence on alienation when controlling for socio-demographic factors. Furthermore, participation in sports activities was an important factor in decreasing alienation levels. The findings of this research imply that materialistic ways of thinking increase alienation and that money cannot contribute to human happiness and well-being. In addition, active participation in social activities can decrease alienation. The research results suggest that a materialistic, money-is-all attitude negatively influences alienation across cultures; in addition, in the US, an affluent consumption-based country, the money-is-all attitude had more explanatory power for alienation than in Sweden and Korea. A change in values to overcome the money-is-all attitude is required and the concepts of sufficiency and mindfulness are suggested as alternative life perspectives for the pursuit of well-being. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Alienation; Cross-cultural comparison; Korea; Money-is-all attitude; Sweden; US,

When humans moved into settled communities with more advanced means of production, the nature of fear-much like the nature of social relationships-changed. Once the means of social reproduction were secured, fear became less necessary as a survival instinct and more useful as a heuristic device. Fear evolved. Fear cannot be characterized solely as a socially constructed phenomenon, nor as the instinctual response to personally felt traumas. The growth and nature of fear must be studied as a process that develops under its own inertia, feeding off its antecedent past, and as a phenomenon that is shaped by and in turn shapes its institutional setting. Fear should be understood as both structurally determined and socially transformative.

Young people belonging to Generation Y have enthusiastically embraced social media as a means of achieving connectedness and managing social relationships. However, there is still a limited understanding of how adolescents actually differentiate between the media they use and of the effects of social media on their lives. This study differs from previous work by proceeding from the assumption that social media present a number of technological paradoxes and identifying what behavioral strategies they develop to derive the greatest possible benefit from, and cope with the ambivalent outcomes of, social media consumption. Design/methodology/approach – An exploratory study design was chosen, combining the use of focus groups and in-depth interviews with 50 Brazilian adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years. Topics of discussion were designed to cover a range of social media relevant to young people. Findings – The authors propose a conceptual model of social media consumption by young people and identify its positive and negative outcomes and the behavioral strategies of media selection and differentiation used to cope with them. These behaviors enable adolescents to derive maximum benefit from social media while minimizing the effort required to use them. Originality/value – This research contributes to marketing theory and practice by assessing the adolescent perspective of social media consumption and offering an integrated model of outcomes and behavioral strategies which they use. This model provides insights relevant to the planning of marketing communications directed towards young people. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Adolescents; Generation Y; Media use; Paradoxes of technology; Social media; Social media effects,

Although lies are generally regarded as a threat to the moral fabric of society, some lies are told in order to maintain or even enhance human relations. Such lies, therefore, could even be justified as an adaptive tool at times essential for the maintenance of social relationships. When speakers of English as a lingua franca (ELF) from different cultural backgrounds interact in order to build and maintain business relationships, the communication problems that develop can be accounted for in terms of differing perceptions that individuals have of what deceptive communication entails. This study aims to redefine intercultural business communication from an Asian perspective by examining naturally occurring business interaction between Japanese and Indian small business owners. The participants seek to establish a mutually beneficial relationship in order to cooperate in joint commercial activity. Special attention is paid to the lies told and detected by interlocutors. Employing the notion of business discourse, this study uses multiple analytical methods. The analysis depicts meaning jointly created as a result of strategic interaction. Because presenting truth tactfully requires of interlocutors' high linguistic and communicative competence, ELF users use lies as an easy strategy for avoiding conflicts. This study emphasizes situated discourse and identity as critical factors affecting intercultural business communication. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.",Deception; English as Lingua Franca; Intercultural Communication,

Of particular importance are social relationships during adolescence that shape adult health behaviors and health outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the association between adolescent peer status in school and later-life quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and healthcare costs. Methods: This study used social network and health outcomes data from Wave I (ages 12-18 years) and Wave III (ages 18-24 years) of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 10,578) to compare QALYs and healthcare costs (in 2012 US$) by adolescent peer status in US schools. Generalized linear models controlled for school fixed effects, individual and family characteristics, and US census block neighborhood effects. Non-parametric bootstrapping accounted for residual skewness in QALYs and healthcare costs. Net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated by converting adjusted 5-year QALYs into US$ values and subtracting 5-year healthcare costs. NMB was then compared across quintiles of adolescent peer status in school at Wave I. Results: Results obtained from non-parametric bootstrapping indicate that adolescents with higher peer status in school experience significantly better health and lower healthcare costs over the next 5 years. At US$50,000 per QALY, adolescents with 8 or more friends achieved NMB of US$214,300 (95 % CI 212,800-215,800) over a 5-year span, in comparison to adolescents with 0-1 friends, who attained US$209,900 (95 % CI 207,900-211,700) NMB. This difference translates into approximately US$4,440 (95 % CI 2,036-6,825) per socially disengaged adolescent in additional health costs and/or reduced QALYs over 5 years. Conclusion: The study calls for randomized controlled trials targeting adolescent peer group structures in schools as a means to promote better health and lower healthcare costs in adulthood. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",,adolescent; adolescent behavior; article; bootstrapping; controlled study; family size; female; friend; health behavior; health care cost; health status; human; male; National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; neighborhood; peer group; personal experience; quality of life; school health service; social interaction; social network; social status; statistical model

All of us want to have satisfying lives. Yet, not everybody is happy, even among the wealthy. Believing that happiness lies through the satisfaction of physical desires and material possessions, many individuals work hard to earn income, often at the expense of leisure and good social relationships. This paper examines the determinants of subjective well-being of entrepreneurs and workers as a group in a South African province, using the principal component approach. Various components emerged as happiness--influencing factors, jointly explaining about 70 per cent of the variation in self-reported well-being. These sets are related to asset ownership, family togetherness and personal attributes, household characteristics, human and social capital, future financial security (pension), work relationships, and community involvement. Religion and creativity account for almost a tenth of the variation in subjective well-being.

Recent experimental evidence has brought to light that the assumptions of the Prospect Theory by Kahneman and Tversky do not hold in the proposed substantive domain of “sociality”. In particular, the desire to be a part of the social environment, i.e. the environment where individuals make decisions among their peers, is not contingent on the framing. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that humans are “social animals” for adaptive reasons. However, entering a social relationship is inherently risky. Therefore, it is extremely important to know how much people value “sociality”, when the social outcomes are valued more than material outcomes and what kinds of adaptations people use. Design/methodology/approach - We develop a new theory and propose the general utility function that features “sociality” component. We test the theory in the laboratory experiments carried out in several countries. Findings - Our results suggest that when stakes are low the theory of “sociality” is successful in predicting individual decisions: On average, people do value “sociality” and it surpasses the monetary loss. Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper is the breakdown of the risk attitudes under low stakes and individual level of decision-making. Another advancement is the ability to formalize the social utility or the theory of “sociality” in an economic model; we use general utility function that we define both on the outcomes and on the process of the decision-making itself and test in laboratory studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited,",Risk attitudes; Sociality; Utility,

During this special moment, children are free to share and swap their snacks, according to their affinities. The study aims to demonstrate how this food consumption is part of the process of children's socialization. Design/methodology/approach: This paper relies on an ethnographic study of children's behaviour during snack time. Two primary schools representing two different social backgrounds are compared. Pupils are aged from six to ten years. The systematic review of children's snacks during a three-month observation period in each school allowed the author to transform the qualitative observations into quantitative data. Findings: The trading of snacks between children gives rise to entire networks, strategies of exchange and sometimes even snacks theft. The food exchanges act as an indicator of social relationships between the kids. In this regard, snack time teaches us even more about children's behavior and socialization. There are two reasons for that, the first one is that the products consumed are chosen, either by the parents or the children themselves and has nothing to do with the lunch served by the school. The second one is that it is a particularly pleasant moment for them, as it is a time for sweet food shared with their peers. Research limitations/implications: This is a limited monograph of the snacking behaviour of 20 children with the highest attendance to afterschool study. Originality/value: The originality of that study is to focus on a space-time and a school food practice that are not often investigated by researchers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Children; Peers; School; Snacks; Socialization; Trade,

The power of important actors to misuse the community forestry approach for their self-interests has been reported as a major obstacle to comprehensive success. Hence, this article aims at developing an analytical, theory-based and empirically applicable framework for assessing an actor's power using community forestry as an illustrative case. The actor-centred power approach (ACP) analysis aims to provide a scientific answer to the question of who are the politically most powerful actors in community forestry practices. In making use of suitable components of power theories it builds strongly upon the social relations of actors, organisational aspects and power sources, as described by Weber, Dahl, Etzioni and their adherents. Actor-centred power approach (ACP) is defined as a social relationship in which actor A alters the behaviour of actor B without recognising B's will. In our framework we distinguish between three core elements: coercion, (dis-)incentives and dominant information. These make up the basis for observable facts that involve not only physical actions but also threats by power elements and the very sources of said power elements. Theoretical considerations show that, despite the focus being on actors, by looking to their power sources a considerable part of structural power can be more tangible at least in part, like rules, discourse or ideologies. Furthermore, the paper shows how the actor-centred power approach distinguishes power from other influences on forest management and contributes to the identification of the group of powerful actors on an empirical basis. Due to the focus on actors and well-defined and observable elements of power, the actor-centred power approach (ACP) could serve not only as a basis for research but also as a tool for quick assessment of power networks, delivering valuable preliminary information for designing forest policy in practice. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Actors; Coercion; Community forestry (CF); Incentives; Information; Power,Timber; Actors; Coercion; Community forestry; Incentives; Information; Power; Forestry; Forestry; Incentives; Information Retrieval; Power

It is because her country and generation have observed a despotic racist ideology and a newly established democracy consequently. She places herself in the middle of these two turbulent realms to diagnose the wicked parts of them. In My Son’s Story (1990) she examines the psychological impacts of prevailed ideologies upon the psyches of common people. She tries to seek some panaceas for these fractured psyches through her fictional works. My Son’s Story gives an account of endeavor and delusion of South African people in their fight for freedom. The socio-political reality of the country under a biased ideology is disclosed through the perceptions of the narrator. This paper tries to rely upon Louis Althusser’s concept of ideology to give a new reading of the novel. Althusser’s perception of freedom as an ideology in shaping people’s consciousness shows the role of ideology in the establishment of social relationships. It brings to the light the interaction between education, society, and freedom. In the novel we come across with particular situations as naturally true. Gordimer makes a significant contribution in literature by bring them into the surface. She delineates the ways of legitimating the power of the ruling class in society. Characters in the novel are unaware of the ideology which surrounds them. They try to shape their identities based on this unconsciously.

Many countries have promoted its cultivation as part of a broader rural development strategy aimed at generating paid work and producing both export commodities and biofuels. However, oil palm expansion has often occurred at the expense of ecosystems and subsistence agriculture, and on lands riddled with tenure conflicts. In this article, we analyse the implications of the combined effect of labouring in oil palm plantations and land access on households, and we discuss how these implications affect human well-being in two indigenous communities of the Polochic valley, Guatemala. Combining participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and land-time budget analysis at household level, we reveal how oil palm cultivation increases incomes for plantation workers' households, but decreases the productivity of maize cultivation, reduces the time that household members have available for other activities and, particularly, reduces women's resting time. In contrast, households that focus more intensively on maize cultivation show higher degrees of food security and women can allocate more time to social activities. However, our results also show that maize consumption per capita has not decreased in households working in oil palm plantations since such crop is considered sacred by the Q'eqchi' and plays a central role in their diet and culture. In conclusion, we argue that while working for an oil palm cultivation can increase specific elements of the basic material conditions for a good life, other aspects such as food security, health, freedom of choice, and social relationships can become deteriorated. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Gender; Guatemala; Indigenous communities; Palm oil; Societal metabolism; Well-being indicators,crop production; cultivation; development strategy; export; food security; household survey; income; maize; oil; plantation; rural development; socioeconomic impact; subsistence agriculture; Guatemala [Central America]; Guatemala [Guatemala (NTN)]; Elaeis; Elaeis guineensis; Zea mays

An Empirical Test of Competing Theoretical Perspectives,2015,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84949317531&partnerID=40&md5=edfbd2ff53e467492414af15a39d7654,"What drives managerial perks? The commonly accepted view of perks suggests that they are a misuse of firm resources for managers’ private benefit (cost view), and thus perk consumption is unethical. However, an alternative view argues that perks can motivate managers to work hard and thus add to the value of the firm (incentive view): from this perspective, perk consumption is an ethical form of behavior. The fundamental difference between the two positions has critical implications for practice, and this article tests these competing views to determine the circumstances in which one view dominates the other. Using hand-collected data on perks in Chinese-listed companies, we find strong empirical support for the incentive view, which is more likely to be held in firms with moderate ownership concentration. This article not only contributes to the literature on business ethics, but also has critical implications for managerial incentive practices in emerging economies. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Agency theory; China; Ethics; Incentive; Perks,

Addressing the problems caused by the unsustainable landscape of the fashion industry requires alternative solutions, new business models or whole systems rethink. Fashion remanufacturing is one such strategy that supports material recirculation and thus reduces land filling of fashion waste. This paper examines the concept of fashion remanufacturing, the requirements for a reverse supply chain and the barriers and opportunities that exist for future growth of this sustainable business. The investigation reveals that although collaboration among key players along the reverse supply chain is essential for business growth, the extent of this growth is dependent on the commitment and involvement of large fashion retailers and the fashion consumer. We conclude the paper by considering the implications for the fashion industry if fashion remanufacture were to become a more mainstream business model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Estimating a simultaneous equations model of ramping incidence, spreads, and the probability of deploying real-time surveillance (RTS), we show that quoted bid-ask spreads are positively related to the incidence of MTC across seven liquidity deciles. The magnitude is economically significant; improving market integrity by cutting MTC in half reduces spreads 6–11 %.

The relationships between state regulations and public nature point to a specific engagement in which nature is divided, distributed, and owned, namely through the market driven prospects of transferable quotas. This article examines fishing quota as a set of relations that links the transformation of fish from biological organism to global product and thus weaves science, the state, markets, and social relationships into an entanglement of different forms of capital. In this context, the tension between the quota holder, the value of that quota, and their participation in the industry reflects a complex network of capital mediated through various strategies. Based on ethnographic research in the Namibian trawl sector, this article surfaces these modes of capital in the dynamics of the fishing operations. As such, the fishing industry, the company that holds the fishing rights, the government's role in quota allocations, the vessels, gear, and technologies, and the relationships and roles of the crewmembers and skippers' knowledge all contribute to a particular formulation of fishing practices. Fisher's knowledge in industrial fishing practices becomes a site in which to explore the consequences of ITQs that may also begin to destabilise the neoliberal business model for fisheries in times of crisis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Capital; Fisher's knowledge; Industrial fishery; ITQs; Namibia; Networks,capital; fishery production; fishing industry; knowledge; quota system; trawling; Erongo; Namibia; Walvis Bay; Rexea solandri

We develop a coherent economic framework of responsible investing to address this paradox. The framework offers theoretical underpinnings for all research on responsible investment as it provides the theoretical underpinnings for the actual behavior of market participants. We associate corporate social performance with key financial accounting ratios like the market-to-book ratio (market value of the firm in relation to accounting value), return on assets, and stock market return. We conclude that there is a strong theoretical foundation for a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, though the relation is conditional on which financial performance measure is considered.

Using a two-by-two factorial design, we conduct four experimental treatments in China and also perform the identifiability treatment in New Zealand as a cultural control. We find that in China both manipulations were positively and significantly related to the probability of a repayment promise being kept. Moreover, these two factors were substitutes for each other.

Despite methodological advances and practical experiences, there is no systematic review that clarifies the current scope and challenges of participatory MCDA in fisheries management, aquaculture and marine conservation. Using the ISI Web of Science database, 95 peer-reviewed publications were found that report MCDA applications in marine management (fisheries or aquaculture) and marine conservation. Of these, 31 studies explicitly and systematically incorporate stakeholders' engagement at one or more stages of the MCDA process. Results show how participative MCDA has been applied in a wide range of marine multi-objective problems. Interestingly, 76% of studies included participation and 24% consultation processes. Most MCDA studies in marine environments were developed in Europe and Asia. Results highlight that despite successful experiences in participative MCDA, participation has been generally fragmented. Participatory processes have focused mainly at particular stages, such as the establishment of objectives and criteria, and elicitation of weights of importance. Conversely, other important stages of MCDA, such as identifying alternatives, estimating consequences or prioritizing management alternatives, exhibited low levels of participation and/or consultation. In addition, results suggest that uncertainties around multiple values judgments are seldom treated in marine MCDA studies. Greater rigor in promoting an active participation in the complete decision process and fully considering the uncertainties around people's value judgments are important research gaps, which if addressed, could substantially improve participative MCDA applications aimed at achieving sustainable management and conservation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Analytic Hierarchical Process; Aquaculture; Consultation; Decision making; Fisheries; MCDA; Participation; Stakeholder engagement,analytical hierarchy process; coastal zone management; decision making; fishery management; multicriteria analysis; resource development; stakeholder; sustainable development; Asia; Europe

This is achieved by drawing on concepts from Michel Henry’s phenomenology of life in the field of business ethics. The French philosopher Michel Henry (1922–2002) is distinguished by his identifying two modes of appearing: ‘intentionality’ (appearing of the world through representations) and ‘affectivity’ (appearing of life). Henry suggests that relying only on abstract representations constitutes a specific ideology that causes individuals at work to ignore the actual experience of being affected, and hinders the appearance of life to guide their actions, in turn hindering ethics. Empirical illustrations are provided by a case study that explores the practices of management accountants in a travel retail corporation. By observing the empirical practices of management accountants, a body of professionals whose role is largely dependent on information technology, abstraction and technical expertise to trace organisational flows and transactions, we shed light on the difficult ethical issues associated with their role of surveillance and control of other managers’ work. The case study illustrates a wide range of everyday working practices among management accountants. Some convey the impression that they lack empathy and consideration for other individuals, while others engage in close cooperation and ethical practices despite the constraining configuration of their role. A significant result of this research is that it illustrates and interprets, based on Henry’s phenomenology, a wide range of working practices. Consistent with Henry, we argue that the source of business ethics lies beyond professional standards, codes and values. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Financial controllers; Information technology; Management accountants; Michel Henry; Phenomenology; Work ethics,

In 2013, the decision was made to transfer the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) to the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), to align the pCODR and CADTH Common Drug Review processes while building on the best practices of both. The objective of this research was to conduct an examination of the best practices established by the pCODR. Methods: A qualitative research approach was taken to assess the policies, processes, and practices of the pCODR, based on internationally accepted best practice “principles” in HTA, with a particular focus on stakeholder engagement. Publicly available information regarding the approach of the pCODR was used to gauge the agency’s performance against these principles. In addition, stakeholder observations and real-world experiences were gathered through key informant interviews to be inclusive of perspectives from patient advocacy groups, provincial and/or cancer agency decision-makers, community and academic oncologists, industry, expert committee members, and health economists. Results: This analysis indicated that, through the pCODR, oncology stakeholders have had a voice in and have come to trust the quality and relevance of oncology HTA as a vital tool to ensure the best decisions for Canadians with cancer and their health care system. It could be expected that adoption of the principles and processes of the pCODR would bring a similar level of engagement and trust to other HTA organizations in Canada and elsewhere. Conclusion: The results of this research led to recommendations for improvement and potential extrapolation of these best practices to other HTA organizations worldwide, along with suggestions for continued evolution of the pCODR in conjunction with its integration into the CADTH. It is clear that the transition of the pCODR to CADTH provides an opportunity for practices initiated by the pCODR to become the standard for these newly amalgamated HTA agencies in Canada. © 2015 Rocchi et al.",Drugs; Health technology assessment; Oncology; Reimbursement,Article; biomedical technology assessment; Canada; Canadian; cancer patient; drug research; health care system; human; interview; oncologist; oncology; patient advocacy; patient decision making; qualitative research; trust

But little evidence has yet been compiled showing the actual results of ocean plans, and whether or not they have delivered on their promise to balance competing interests through a collaborative process that considers environmental concerns. This paper presents an empirical study of five government-approved ocean plans, all of which resulted in broadly shared net benefits. Economically, these five ocean plans delivered on average $60 million per year in value from new industries and retained value in existing industries, although some stakeholders bore losses and government spending did not decrease. Environmentally, planning increased marine protection, ensured industrial uses avoided sensitive habitat, cut carbon emissions, and reduced the risk of oil spills. Socially, marine planning increased broad stakeholder engagement (thus improving design and administration of plans), while building trust that will likely improve sustainable future use of ocean space. © 2015 The Authors.",Conservation; Economic value; Marine spatial planning; Ocean planning; Social impact,empirical analysis; nature conservation; public spending; social impact; spatial planning; stakeholder

This study proposes a business approach addressing the common barriers against the strong presence of sustainable construction materials in these countries. The Egyptian market was selected as a candidate for a potential sustainable transformation. The use of sustainable concrete is advocated as a pivotal market transformation that warrants technical leverage in the construction industry and ensures local development as well as global competitiveness. A mixed-mode survey was performed to estimate the level of understanding of sustainable construction and, thus, gauge market's receptiveness to change. Like most sustainable changes in developing countries, the use of sustainable concrete in Egypt as a mainstream construction material is challenged by the stagnant culture of the industry and the absence of a proactive legislative role. Business implementation of the desired transformation is suggested to endure the three stages of the Kotter's model for change: unfreeze-change-lock. In view of the noted commonness of the barriers and similarities in construction cultures of developing countries, due consideration to the proposed approach could be given in these markets. The business dimension of this effort is intended to complement past attempts promoting sustainable transformation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual model originates from EC adoption study backgrounds, grounded in the major concepts of frequently EC adoption and their dependent-extended models. Literature review presents relevant items under their main first order factors, including family SMEs' heterogeneity factors, categorized by contexts. Findings - The model, in which EC adoption refers to the significance of ‘Extent of Deployment’ as innovation behavior, respecting to the theoretical basis of human behavior including essential pure theories (i.e. Learning; Anchoring-and-Adjustment) and major concepts of frequently EC adoption models (TAM; TPB; SCT; DOI), besides role of family SMEs' heterogeneity factors (i.e. The moderating effects of 'Family Strategic Orientation') provided a basis for assessing potential EC adoption antecedents (under which different facets of EC adoption would be considered) including 13th first orders, categorized under four main individual, organizational, industrial, and national contexts. Practical implications - As a sustainable business market mean, EC adoption as an extra-exploitation of electronic commerce, making wider and more diversified external ‘business-linked’ and/or ‘customer-linked’ business relationships, particularly for family SMEs that suffer from 'marketing deficiency', time and effort is necessary so as to identify influencing factors and diagnose their effects on EC deployment in such Iranian SMEs, where EC adoption is questionably near to ground. The presented model is quite valuable for the analysis. Originality/value - This paper presents a conceptual model for analyzing EC adaption factors under related contexts. Independent influences of 12 first potential factors categorized in four contexts as well as the moderation effect of 'family strategic orientation' variable on EC adoption are studied in the model. The design differs from previous studies as they used dichotomous approaches for ‘family strategic Orientation' determination. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

Recent debates have explored whether these initiatives represent opportunities for the “democratization” of transnational corporations, facilitating civic participation in the extension of corporate responsibility, or whether they constitute new arenas for the expansion of corporate influence and the private capture of regulatory power. In this article, we explore the political dynamics of these new governance initiatives by presenting an in-depth case study of an organization often heralded as a model MSI: the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). An effort to address global deforestation in the wake of failed efforts to agree a multilateral convention on forests at the Rio Summit (UNCED) in 1992, the FSC was launched in 1993 as a non-state regulatory experiment: a transnational MSI, administering a global eco-labeling scheme for timber and forest products. We trace the scheme’s evolution over the past two decades, showing that while the FSC has successfully facilitated multi-sectoral determination of new standards for forestry, it has nevertheless failed to transform commercial forestry practices or stem the tide of tropical deforestation. Applying a neo-Gramscian analysis to the organizational evolution of the FSC, we examine how broader market forces and resource imbalances between non-governmental and market actors can serve to limit the effectiveness of MSIs in the current neo-liberal environment. This presents dilemmas for NGOs which can lead to their defection, ultimately undermining the organizational legitimacy of MSIs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Civic regulation; CSR; Deliberative democracy; Eco-labeling; Environment; Forests; Global governance; Gramsci; Multi-stakeholder initiatives; Non-governmental organizations; Transnational politics,

Stakeholder workshops were undertaken with participants being free to identify objectives based on their own insights and needs. Overall 26 objectives were proposed, with 58% agreement in proposed objectives between two workshops. Based on published evidence for pressure-state links, examples of operational objectives and suitable indicators for each of the 26 objectives were then selected. It is argued that given the strong species-specific links of pelagic species with the environment and the large geographic scale of their life cycles, which contrast to demersal systems, pelagic indicators are needed at the level of species (or stocks) independent of legislative region. Pelagic community indicators may be set at regional scale in some cases.

A representative survey of the boat-based angling population in Puget Sound, WA, USA, was conducted to provide baseline information regarding angler knowledge about rockfish, fishing practices, perceptions of threats to rockfish, and preferences for recovery measures to inform the recovery plan for three rockfish species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the hypothesis that variation in stakeholders[U+05F3] perceived threats to rockfish and preferences for rockfish recovery measures is related to their fishing practices and knowledge of rockfish biology. Knowledge of rockfish longevity and past experience fishing for rockfish were important predictors of support for conservation measures and willingness to take personal action to recover rockfish. These findings highlight the important role education may play in garnering the necessary long-term support for rockfish recovery. Further, locations where anglers fished in Puget Sound were found to shape perceptions of threats to rockfish, suggesting that place-based management options should be considered where biologically appropriate. This study illustrates both the utility and complexity of species management in social-ecological systems and provides a framework for comprehensively engaging stakeholders and understanding their relationships with endangered and threatened species prior to the development of a recovery plan. Such engagement may not only better inform management and outreach decisions but also pave the way toward more collaborative and effective endangered species management and conservation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Conservation; Endangered species; Management; Rockfish; Social-ecological surveys; Stakeholder outreach,conservation management; Endangered Species Act; recovery plan; species conservation; stakeholder; Puget Sound; United States; Washington [United States]

In the model considered a number of scenarios under which relationships of the company with the stakeholder groups vary periodically. For each scenario periodically predicted the dynamics of changes in the characteristics of such relations, and calculated weighing coefficients of applicability of the type of engagement strategy of the company with each stakeholder group. Coefficients obtained are reduced to integral coefficients based on which, using a generalized criterion that combines the expected value and the mean squared deviation, made the decision on the choice of a particular type of engagement strategies of the company with each stakeholder. This approach allows to select and rank the Pareto-optimal set of types of strategies and delimit the risk tolerance of the decision maker. The model also provides a method of selecting the most suitable type of strategy based on the expected utility criterion. The advantage of the proposed model is that it takes into account the risk tolerance of the decision-maker. © 2015 Canadian Center of Science and Education.

These processes are intended to include and integrate appropriate economic, environmental, and social input into decision-making. To address identified challenges with gathering social data this study uses the Q-method to characterize different perspectives about what is valued about the ocean, seafood, and the community in the seafood sector of a single coastal community in British Columbia, Canada. Drawing on a sample of 42 people from the sector, this study identified a range of values, that group together into five distinct perspectives. These perspectives provide insight into how people value the experience versus the utility of the ocean and the different value they attribute to the outcomes of ocean management versus the process deployed. Values do not group together by seafood sub-sector, although the importance of teaching, stewardship, and conservation and respect for the ocean's resilience are common to all. On the other hand, the various perspectives most sharply diverge with respect to the role of aquaculture and special rights of access. This work demonstrates how the Q-method can help to identify, capture, and compare social values within a sector. In addition, this method can provide participants with a forum to discuss what is important and can provide a common vocabulary that cuts across existing constituencies. This has the potential to facilitate the consideration of a broad range of social values in ocean management. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Eco-system based approach; Integrated ocean management; Seafood sector; Social values; Stakeholder engagement,conservation management; decision making; ecosystem management; environmental values; food industry; marine ecosystem; seafood; stakeholder; British Columbia; Canada

The econometrical framework applies an ESG portfolio approach using the Carhart (1997) four-factor model as well as cross-sectional Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions. Previous empirical research indicates a relationship between ESG ratings and returns. As against this, the ESG portfolios do not state a significant return difference between companies with high and low ESG ratings. Although the Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions reveal a significant influence of several ESG variables, investors are hardly able to exploit this relationship. The magnitude and direction of the impact are substantially dependent on the rating provider, the company sample and the particular subperiod.

However, most of the propositions made by CSR scholars have been described as being normative and prescriptive in nature. The implication of this is that the process through which outcomes are generated from the implementation of CSR lacks adequate exploration and has remained relatively unknown. To explore the problem noted above, a literature review was carried out. The need for a paradigm shift from responsiveness paradigm to a performance based paradigm in the practice of CSR was observed. A performance based paradigm entails the generation of expected outcomes from the implementation of CSR through creating value alignment between business’ values and stakeholders’ values. From the literature review, three recommendations were generated. They include the need for a shift towards a performance based paradigm of CSR, need for the exploration of the interactive process in the relationship between business and society, and the need for more empirical based studies with focus on the interactive process of CSR as a means of predicting CSR outcomes. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

Design/methodology/approach – This study tested these relationships through canonical correlation analyses. The data used were drawn from corporate HQ and 63 subsidiaries, which were publicly listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange in 2007. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used in the study. Findings – The results generally indicated that the isomorphism between the CSR practices of the HQ and those of their subsidiaries could impact both the CSP, especially the product and employee dimensions, and the CFP. No relationship was found to exist between the CSP and CFP. Originality/value – Despite extensive interest by scholars and practitioners in the subject area, relatively little is known about the management of CSR by the multinational enterprises (MNEs) (Meyer, 2004), as the literature does not systematically examine the effects that occur on employee performance following the diffusion of CSR among the MNEs subsidiaries. Extending earlier literature on CSR, by integrating the effect of the CFP, the present study focuses on the effects of isomorphism between the CSR practices of the MNEs and those of their subsidiaries on both CSP and CFP. Further, the study examined the interrelation of CSP and CFP from the perspective of international management. Given the increased interest in corporate governance matters at the international level, CSR plays a central and fundamentally important role in the corporate governance of the MNEs because of both globalization forces and the pressures exerted by stakeholders. In this context, this paper is one of the first to explore the transfer of CSR practices from the MNEs to their subsidiaries. The effect of CSR on performance is an important research question, especially for emerging markets (Ibrahim and Angelidis, 1995; Waddock and Graves, 1997; Ghazali, 2007; Johnson and Greening, 1999). Despite the importance of this issue, however, until recently, only a limited discussion has been evident in the literature on CSR in the international arena with particular reference given to the emerging economies. Studying the effects of the CSR isomorphism on the performance in Turkish context is justified in three ways. First, Turkey is the largest emerging economy in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East (Tatoglu et al., 2003, p. 7). It presents the emerging nature of the market and the transitional characteristics of the institutional environment (Cavusgil et al., 2002). Second, the drivers for CSR in Turkey, such as the other emerging markets whose institutional characteristics and economic fundamentals is similar, are exogenous and institutional rather than endogenous factors (Ararat and Gocenoglu, 2006, p. 11). Excluding the philanthropic activities, the very first manifestations of CSR were observed in the business conduct of MNEs in Turkey (Ararat and Gocenoglu, 2006, p. 11). MNEs have a dominant and leader role in Turkey for CSR practices. Finally, the subsidiaries operating in Turkey are less likely to resist the transfer of the organizational policies and practices such as human resource management policies (Sayim, 2010, 2011) and organizational culture (Ilhan, 2008). In fact, they want to even transfer the policies and practices from MNEs (Sayim 2010, 2011; Ilhan, 2008). Therefore, Turkish context provides a good case to test the effects of the CSR isomorphism on the performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance; Institutional theory; Isomorphism; Social performance; Turkey,

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative self-administered survey was conducted with a convenience sample of Vietnamese business students at a banking university in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This study used the 30-item Attitudes Toward Business Ethics Questionnaire (ATBEQ) constructed by Neumann and Reichel (1987) based on the work of Stevens (1979). The Vietnamese version questionnaire was distributed, and 282 surveys were used for analysis. An item-by-item analysis was conducted based on gender and the experience of having taken a business ethics course. Findings – Significant differences were found on seven items based on gender and four items based on the experience of having taken a business ethics course. However, respondents appeared to have similar attitudes on the majority of the items. Research limitations/implications – Perhaps the greatest limitation of this study is the relatively uneven distribution of the respondents in the sample. The sample is skewed slightly toward women who are a bit older, fourth year or post-graduate and those who have not taken a business ethics course. In addition convenience sampling technique reduced its generalizability. This study is important because it supports the idea of ethics education to improve ethical decision-making of future business leaders and that education has an effect in Vietnam. Practical implications – As business students are the main subjects of this research, it can be useful for those involved in development of management and business education in Vietnam to have an overview on how gender impacts business students’ ethics perception. For the executives of multinational corporations, this study provides important information and adds support to a decision to do business in Vietnam. Social implications – Although there may be a perception of a less than ethical climate in Vietnam based on its Corruption Perception Index scores, it appears that Vietnamese business students in general express an ethical viewpoint. This study emphasizes the importance of ethics education that is culture-specific to build a strong ethical business environment that can help Vietnam prevent bribery and corruption and achieve sustainable growth and prosperity. Originality/value – This study contributes to the attitudes toward business ethics research and sheds light on the impact of gender and education (business ethics course) on Vietnamese business students’ ethical attitudes.

Building on an in-depth case study, a model of stakeholder engagement through identity, governance and legitimacy is presented. Stakeholders are managed by an identity constructed through an integration of the organization's multiple identities to form a meta-identity. Governance is important in the management of stakeholders in order to be entrepreneurial while being accountable. Stakeholders support the organization based on legitimacy that is gained through creating stakeholder value and by conforming to existing social structures as well as creating new operating models, practices and ideas. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",identity; opportunity; Social entrepreneurship; stakeholders,

CR was devised by the corporate capitalist elite, broadly defined, as an instrument for pre-empting governmental intervention. Corporations responded to surging public expectations for governmental-not corporate- assumption of social responsibility. In deploying CR practices, they would strategically enable the creation of the latter at the expense of the former, thus redefining the parameters of business's role in society and, along with it, the societal division of regulatory labour in the direction of increasing privatization. It is hypothesized that present-day attempts at 'civil regulation' of corporations embody a script of interaction among companies, publics and states that was designed to secure corporate power rather than limit it. Synthesizing organizational neoinstitutionalism and elite theory, the article shows how elites can defend their position of power through engagement in a 'defensive institutionalization project', that is, a sophisticated modification of the system aimed at redefining the very perceptions and strategies of everyone involved. © The Author 2014.",Capitalism; Corporate social responsibility; Historical sociology; Institutions; Power,

Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained through questionnaire survey and analyzed using regression analysis. Findings – A total of 221 respondents representing a 88.4 per cent response rate completed the questionnaire. The regression results show that ethics instruction received during tertiary education have a significant impact on both legal and illegal business scenarios. Accountants also judged an illegal questionable scenario stricter than a legal questionable scenario. Research limitations/implications – The questionnaires were distributed to those firms which participated in the internship programmed. Although the firms which participated were of varying sizes, care still needs to be taken in interpreting the results, as representativeness remains an issue in studies of small sample size. Practical implications – The findings appear to suggest that ethics is an important factor influencing ethical judgments. Hence, the subject should be taught at least at the tertiary level so as to inculcate ethical values early in younger generation. An ethically imbued workforce can be expected to make sound and equitable corporate decisions. Originality/value – The study offers preliminary insight into the benefit of introducing the business ethics course in the undergraduate accounting programmed at public universities in Malaysia. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Accountants; Business ethics; Ethical judgments; Gender; Malaysia,

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative self-administered survey was conducted with a convenience sample of Vietnamese working adults obtained through educational institutions, businesses and entrepreneurs and private and public sector organizations. This study used Clark and Clark’s (1966) Personal Business Ethics Scores measure. The Vietnamese version questionnaire was distributed, and a total of 704 surveys were fully completed and analyzed. Findings – Statistically significant differences were found in the variables of age, gender and government work experience. Management experience did not lead to any significant differences. Consequently, Kohlberg’s moral development theory regarding ethical development is partially supported. Research limitations/implications – This study used a convenience sample population. Future studies can compare specific populations in different parts of the country with similar working backgrounds and demographic variables. The small sample size is not necessarily representative of an entire country or the culture in Vietnam. Furthermore, it would be meaningful to investigate the relationship between ethical development and the demographic variables among other Asian countries near Vietnam. Finally, longitudinal studies can be implemented by future researchers to investigate the effects of changes in demographic variables on moral development. Practical implications – Females should be studied more to determine the factors that they consider when making decisions that impact others. Having longer time “socializing” with organizational values might be a stronger influence on ethical behaviors of a person. Vietnamese people are less tolerant for unethical behaviors when they are much younger and when they are much older. Social implications – The importance of ethics education programs at the national and organizational levels is underscored as a key element to combat corruption. Several specific recommendations on how to enhance the fight against corruption and bribery were provided.

We then present a couple of approaches we have used to advance the understanding and teaching of business ethics and entrepreneurship as a set of foundational principles. As contextual framing for our analysis we convened eight colloquia/workshops over the past three years that bring a wide-ranging group of business school faculty, scholars in complementary disciplines, and business practitioners into a small-group setting to have in-depth conversations about the role of business ethics and entrepreneurship within the business school. Data used in our analysis catalog the ways and the degree to which AACSB-accredited business schools focus their undergraduate curricula and degree program structure on ethics and entrepreneurship. Working through publically available data, primarily from business school websites, we use content analysis as a framework for statistical analysis of the alignment between how a business school articulates strategic focus (mission, vision, and purpose statements) and how it structures its curricular offerings and degree programs.

Nevertheless, there are countless socio-economic, medico-techno-scientific, environmental and ethical philosophical questions that are far from being settled. In pursuit of a more desirable and sustainable future, this work problematizes current corporate responsibility (CR) research, education and practice. Design/methodology/approach - This contribution provides a critical perspective on the future of CR research and practice and offers a way forward based on theoretical prescience. Findings - The paper delineates a taxonomy of typical crises, categorized as burning, existential, overlooked and neglected crises. This taxonomy can be used as a tool for all forms of scenario analysis, empirical work and policymaking. This allows various futures issues to be given targeted interventions, assigned a focal theory, or allocated differentiated resources and appropriate time and space depending on their technical nature and the institutional context within which the issues unfold. Social implications - This paper argues that CR research risks losing steam despite its near ubiquitous nature and the major contributions hitherto made. Nevertheless, when problems are strategically thought out in the light of the taxonomy above, they provide promising avenues for insightful research and value-creating practice to meet the expectations of both business and society.

In the context of Confucianism, one must adopt the ethical teachings in a moderate or ""middle"" way. We should not be too attached to the liberal interpretation of the Confucian texts but must have the wisdom to apply the concepts case-by-case. The issue then is if there are no legal consequences or punishment, then how we can ensure that someone will continue to comply with the standards. Design/methodology/approach-The authors analyze the Confucian texts in relation to the enforcement of the ethical standards. The authors investigate the Entity Maximization and Sustainability Model by referring to the exit option, the voice option, the influence exerted on the board of directors, the sending of the Confucian representatives to sit on the board of directors, the oppression remedy and statutory derivative actions. The authors adopt a comparative study approach and argue that the Confucian enforcement of ethics can fill in the gap where common law rules of procedure cannot reach in the context of Chinese corporate governance system. Findings-By referring to the Confucian teaching, there are several ways to encourage the superior to follow the ethical standards, namely, education, fear of punishment by society, peer pressure, intrinsic value, continuing education and codification of Confucian value/moral standards. In addition, there are several enforcement options based on the Entity Maximization and Sustainability Model, which is highly relevant to the enforcement model of Confucianism.

Forest management entails multiple social situations such as consultations or cooperative engagements between owners and forest professionals. Successful social endeavours rest on positive social capital as operationalised via trust. Based on qualitative in-depth interviews with forest owners, managers and other forestry stakeholders, this study explores how trust influences the social relationships in a local context of Southern Swedish forestry. Most strikingly, the analysis reveals large differences in owners' trust towards two major actors: the Swedish Forest Agency (SFA) and the forest owner association (FOA) Södra. Permanence of personnel, a client-based approach, and personal features of SFA's local forest officer lead to strong local anchoring and high trust towards SFA. Södra proved to be a trustful partner in the aftermath of calamities; however its industrial priorities seem to erode owners' trust. The empirical findings of this study demonstrate the importance of recognising personal relationships and the catalysing role of bonding social capital in order to understand the local forest management situations. Our results are useful for forestry organisations and policy-makers willing to comprehend the local context and implement best practices in small-scale forestry. •The study examines social capital in a local setting of Southern Swedish forestry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Bonding social capital; NIPF owners; Particularised trust; Swedish Forest Agency; Södra,Social aspects; Timber; Bonding social capitals; Client-based approach; Co-operative engagement; NIPF owner; Particularised trust; Personal relationships; Social relationships; Swedishs; Forestry; Forest Management; Forestry

To clarify what is meant by “pragmatism” as a philosophy for social and environmental accountability (SEA) research, to survey its use within this research field and to explore how a further pursuit of pragmatism may extend this research field. Design/methodology/approach – An extensive review of the SEA literature was conducted in order to determine what aspects of the philosophy of pragmatism have been used within the research. The authors organised the discussion of the literature around the pragmatist ideas of “truth” and “sensemaking”. Findings – SEA research is a heterogeneous space in which various ideas are commonly attributed to the philosophical notion of pragmatism. However, there is a tension in the literature between seeing accounting as a medium for representing social and environmental organisational activities and a pragmatist view of accountings as a way of allowing managers and stakeholder to make sense of these same activities. Research limitations/implications – A clearer development of the ideas of pragmatism may be used to redirect the focus of SEA research in a number of useful ways. Seeing accounting as a medium of sensemaking between organisations and their stakeholders allows the authors to widen the exploration of accounting not only to the production of reports but also their interpretation by users. The ideas of pragmatism also allow the authors to explore the ways stakeholders might affect change within organisations and how accounting may support this process rather than capture or limit it. Practical implications – This paper concludes by providing a set of methodological prescriptions for conducting future SEA research in a way that is inspired by pragmatism. It outlines an approach to research that focuses on users and their sensemaking and encourages an exploration of the possible ways accounting may create positive change in organisations. Originality/value – Overall, this paper refines what it means to follow pragmatism within SEA research.

An issue arises for those who espouse the mainstream view, when looking at certain types of non-collateralized debt obligations, such as student loans. If those owning student debt own capital, which seems true, then what exactly do they own?

A directional shift is required from a cooperative model to a collaborative model of federal governance in view of various endogenous and exogenous imperatives of change, such as rising assertiveness of civil society; rising “self awareness” of regional and local political elites; globalization, privatization, and retreat of the central state; and increasing reliance of the national government on intergovernmental coordination mechanisms rather than centralized/hierarchical mechanisms for policy making and implementation. Thus, I reflect on the possibility of supplementing the federal practice in India (known for being “federal in form and unitary in spirit”) with collaborative institutions and deliberative processes to achieve policy coordination. Institutional reforms are required to generate the right incentives for welfare enhancing, multi-stakeholder engagement and thereby improve the quality of democracy. Three suggestions offered are: (1) expansion of the existing structural and functional horizons of the Inter-State Council (ISC) to engage, inter alia, non-state actors, enabling it to function as a quasi judicial “collaborative council”; (2) offer constitutional status to the newly formed “collaborative community of national and international experts, practitioners, and partners” named NITI Aayog because only a “constitutional mechanism” can prevent the process/institution(s) of multi stakeholder engagement from being marred by ad-hocism and (3) transfer the financial allocation function of the erstwhile Planning Commission to a permanent Finance Commission because a collaborative federal architecture can develop only in the context of a balanced, transparent, and distortion free system of intergovernmental fiscal relations. © 2015 by De La Salle University.",Collaborative council; Collaborative federalism; Cooperative federalism; Coordination mechanisms; Federalism; India; Inter-state council; Intergovernmental interactions; National development council,

Although case studies made flexible use of the framework to account for the particularities of the local realms, the revealed pattern of associated uncertainty was highly consistent across the case studies. The scored pedigree matrices showed that the criteria 'stakeholder engagement' and 'cross validation' had greatest influence on the overall robustness of the case study assessments. The observed distribution of median pedigree scores was within acceptable ranges with respect to simulated possible score distributions. In addition, a sensitivity analysis revealed that the scoring of the pedigree criteria by five or more experts would result in less variable interquartile ranges of respective median scores. In conclusion, the developed complementary tools showed great flexibility in characterising and assessing uncertainty despite context-dependent differences among case studies such as geographical area, quality of available data, level of spatial management implementation or management objectives. Moreover, the obtained findings allow prioritising efforts and future research to support an iterative monitoring and evaluation of marine spatial plans. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Integrated assessment; Marine spatial planning; Monte Carlo simulation; Pedigree matrix; Semi-quantitative uncertainty analysis; Walker matrix,computer simulation; conservation management; ecosystem management; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; integrated approach; marine environment; matrix; Monte Carlo analysis; spatial planning; stakeholder; uncertainty analysis; Europe
Chae B.,Insights from hashtag #supplychain and Twitter analytics: Considering Twitter and Twitter data for supply chain practice and research,2015,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84929513110&partnerID=40&md5=7c15e05072745f0422a213583f08cceb,"Abstract Recently, businesses and research communities have paid a lot of attention to social media and big data. However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies - descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics - for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies' delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research. Finally, the limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are presented. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Application Programming Interface (API); Big data; Content analytics; Data analytics; Network analytics; Social media analytics; Supply chain management; Twitter,Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Chains; Computer systems programming; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Information management; Manufacture; Natural language processing systems; Research and development management; Risk management; Social networking (online); Content analytics; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Data analytics; Environmental standards; Social media analytics; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain risk management; Twitter; Supply chain management

Some market intermediaries have responded by requiring that their suppliers abide by restrictive production practices. We examine the economic effects of such restrictions and apply this analysis to limitations on the use of antibiotics in U.S. pork production. Results from conceptual and simulation analyses show that, in the absence of demand growth, less pork is sold due to higher costs in the restricted segment, and both pork consumers (on average) and producers are harmed. Demand growth of between 6-11% from adding new consumers who will consume the restricted (antibiotic-free) product but not the conventional product is needed to return consumer surplus to the level in the base case, and between 2-4% demand growth was required to return producer surplus to base. When restricted and conventional products are modeled using a vertical differentiation framework, results depend importantly on the ease with which consumers can switch to a seller who offers their desired product type. Significant distributional impacts among consumers are present when switching costs are prohibitive. © The Author 2015.",Animal welfare; Antibiotics; Corporate responsibility; Food quality; HOG production,animal welfare; antibiotics; food market; food quality; livestock farming; meat; United States; Animalia

Design/methodology/approach-The paper consists of a literature review and two surveys. The literature review concentrates on exploring investors’ and tenants’ CR and sustainability drivers. Empirical evidence was gathered via two specific surveys. The first survey targeted investors, and the second survey targeted tenants to determine the focus areas of sustainability. Findings-The findings of this study indicate that the vicious circle of blame can be turned into one of cooperation with respect to sustainable buildings if the mutual drivers for improving sustainability are linked with investor–tenant collaboration. Based on the survey, the tenants claim that productivity, corporate culture and image are the primary drivers for sustainable buildings, whereas the investors claim that corporate culture and image, tenant demand and marketability are the primary drivers. Both parties mentioned the same sustainability drivers: corporate culture and image and lower operating costs. However, it was found that investors are not communicating their CR actions to public or promoting image and productivity benefits of green buildings to potential tenants. Research limitations/implications-The limitation of this study is the sampling of Nordic countries, as there are indications of different situation in other markets such as the USA. Originality/value-Improving sustainability in the real estate industry is linked to investor– tenant collaboration. In addition to common drivers, both investors and tenants have their own list of benefits and drivers for sustainable buildings. These drivers are linked to each other. Making progress with respect to sustainability in the built environment depends on people in the industry being aware of the importance of and possibilities offered by sustainable buildings, as well as being able and willing to act on this knowledge. Only through partnership can the full potential of the built environment be realised and help deliver an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Corporate real estate; Drivers; Investor; Sustainability; Sustainable buildings; Tenant,

It reviews the use of a whistleblower to highlight AML irregularities rather than official reporting through the current AML compliance system. The article uses secondary data to offer a viewpoint on the HSBC issues from a money laundering and financial crime perspective. It extracts key statements from staff at HSBC and regulators, and examines how AML risk assessment was undertaken at this time and what changes need to occur in the future. It considers the implications of the current theoretical context for AML from an agency theory perspective. The main findings are that AML compliance needs to be embedded into a proactive corporate social responsibility approach, rather than relying solely on regulation to improve detection and reporting of money laundering activity. The research topic is new and therefore analysis papers and other academic writing on this topic are limited. Future research could consider the outcomes of the Swiss bank's attempts to prosecute the whistleblower and whether this would have implications for future internal reporting and whistleblowing approaches to support AML compliance. The outcomes from the research are the recommendations to the banking sector on addressing AML deficiencies, especially within the context of an evolving level of criminal sophistication towards money laundering. The article supports the argument for integrating social corporate responsibility and AML compliance in order to produce a whole bank response to financial crime. This is in contrast to the current systems that seem to be prevalent within the financial services, of profit and business being seen as separate rather than integral to regulation and control. The value of this article is the current example of the HSBC Swiss case and the focus specifically on AML compliance rather than tax evasion, which has been the media angle on the issue. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1741-3591.",,

In contrast with other findings which predict a positive relationship between company share price and levels of corporate social responsibility disclosures, the latter are found to have no significant association with company share price over and above the associations of the size of a firm’s equity and net income. Bivariate associations, however, indicate a significant association between share price and levels of corporate social responsibility disclosures.

The article describes the new margin-value-based approach to transportation services pricing, which is based on the ideas of stakeholder management, integrated management systems, cost-volume profit analysis methodology. Unlike traditional approaches to the operation analysis, the new model provides for constant financial cost of the invested capital, income tax and building the target economic value added (EVA) in order to maintain growth of the company’s value. The authors introduce the ‘modified marginal coverage’, which includes (in addition to operating costs) all the above components. Break-even graph (where the company’s EVA is equal to zero) is presented. In terms of the margin-value-based pricing, the authors structured the estimated price of transportation services, which allows to apply differentiated approach to cost management at a certain level and EVA generation, controlling and balancing between the interests of various stakeholders. Unlike traditional pricing models, in which the lower limit of the price may ruin the value, application of the new model allows to set the company’s target growth rates by estimating minimum sales and the lower level of the transportation service price, which determine the value creation frontier for various scenarios of the development strategy implementation. The authors suggest specific indicators for transactions efficiency, operations of revenue generating units, customer performance, which allow not just to conduct factor analysis, but also to affect motivation of the company’s employees. Application of the suggested pricing method will contribute to increase in the company’s value and maintain long-term economic growth. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

However, specifically regarding the medical supply chain literature, analysis of unethical behavior in a buyer-supplier relationship has received limited attention. The importance attached to ethical values in buyer-supplier engagements positively affects the continuity of the relationship. In this study, the following issues have been investigated: (1) whether the unethical behaviors of the supplier have a negative impact on the continuity of the relationship between the parties, and (2) the moderating effects of the procedural and distributive justice of the buyer on the relationship. Data have been collected from 307 pharmacies and analyzed utlizing the PLS (Partial Least Squares) based structural equation modeling technique. The findings obtained indicate that only the deceitful unethical behavior of the supplier directly affects the continuity of the relationship. At the same time, procedural and distributive justice of the buyer negatively influences the continuity of the relationship. However it has been determined that procedural and distributive justice do not moderate the relationship between the unethical behavior and continuity of the relationship.

Outcomes refer to the impacts of the firm on the natural environment, while processes are the firm's actions to reduce these outcomes. We focus on a specific outcome - carbon emissions - and suggest that it affects Tobin's q non-linearly. We find that firms achieve the highest financial performance when their carbon performance is neither low nor high, but intermediate. We also find that environmental processes moderate this relationship as they reinforce firms' financial performance through improved stakeholder management. This mixed picture suggests that firms do not generally internalize the costs of poor carbon performance, but those that stand out in both environmental outcomes and processes achieve net financial benefits.

As part of this solution, retailers (and other brands) reimagined how GHG emissions should be allocated-shifting from a productionist-based to a consumptionist-based perspective-and redefined what they are responsible for and what their supply chains must care about. The article argues that the complexity involved in engaging tens, hundreds, or even thousands of individual organizations across numerous products' supply chains means that requirements to measure and reduce a product's carbon footprint cannot, and are not, simply pushed down a supply chain. Rather through a confluence of the practices of translation, observation, and normalization retailers are creating, fostering, and articulating new regimes of responsibilization within which actors across successive tiers of a product's supply chains must measure, monitor, and reduce their own carbon footprints independently, conscientiously, and diligently, thereby enabling retailers to achieve carbon reductions at a distance. Seen through the Foucauldian-inspired lens of the technologies of the self and self-government under neoliberal governance regimes, this article suggests that, through the control of what is in a product's carbon footprint, how this should be measured, and how it should be reduced-what are called here carbon truths-global retailers are working to consolidate their socioeconomic powers as sustainability leaders that fundamentally direct society's response to, and mitigation of, climate change. © 2015 Clark University.",Carbon economy; Carbon truths; Corporate social responsibility; Foucault; Product carbon footprint; Supply chain governance,carbon emission; carbon footprint; corporate strategy; emissions trading; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; organizational framework; sustainable development

A gentleman in the context of Confucianism tends to be inclusive and broad-minded in embracing the interest of different stakeholders. In fact, he will balance the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders if there is any inherent conflict and try to achieve a win-win situation. Ultimately, he will run the company not just for profit-making but for social justice and commitment. Design/methodology/approach - The authors examine the leading cases in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom about the law of fiduciary duty and the duty of care and its relationship with Confucianism. In this respect, we review the teachings of the traditional Confucian texts and use Confucianism to fill in the gap where common law rules cannot reach. In addition, we adopt a comparative study approach in examining the law of directors' duties in Hong Kong, China and the United Kingdom. Findings - It can be seen that the concept of fiduciary duty and duty of care is quite complicated and evolving and always subject to the interpretations of the court from time to time. For fiduciary duty, the term itself is quite conceptual and not immediately available to the general public. But loyalty in the context of Confucianism is a very lively and down-to-earth moral principle. Besides, fiduciary duty is imposed from outside, where directors had no choice but to accept. But loyalty in the context of Confucianism is something inherent and something from within. It is a moral principle that if you deeply understand the meaning of it, you will automatically accept it as a good virtue and your conduct will naturally be guided by such a principle. Confucianism can thereby be used to fill the gap where rules and regulations cannot reach. Confucian business ethics and common law rule should be complementary to each other in the development of a Chinese corporate governance system. Originality/value - This paper is the first of its kind in discussing the relationship between the law of directors' duties and Confucianism. It argues that Confucianism plays a crucial role in guiding the behavior of the directors and can supplement the abstract principles of directors' duties in the context of a Chinese corporate governance system. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Chinese business ethics; Confucian teachings of loyalty and faithfulness; Confucianism; The law of fiduciary duty and the duty of care,

Seldom is consideration given to the existence of informal and criminal entrepreneurship within the fishing industry. Consequentially, this case charts the “Black Fish Scandal” in the UK which saw the flouting of regulations and quotas on a commercial scale netting the protagonists £63 million through the illegal landing of undeclared fish. Design/methodology/approach: The case study underpinning this paper is constructed using documentary research techniques. Findings: Entrepreneurship can be destructive in a Baumolian sense as well as being productive. The moral of the story is that the entrepreneurs involved in the scandal are primarily small businessmen and not organized criminals; and that lessons can be learned from this case on how knowledge of entrepreneurship can be used to ensure that entrepreneurs and businessmen are not tempted to stray into the commission of economic crime. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of the study is that it was constructed solely from media reports of the scandal. The implications of this study are widespread for politicians, local government, policy makers and academic researchers alike and highlight the rise and fall of an industry and the impact of “laissez-faire” entrepreneurship on the industry suggesting to politicians, local government, policy makers that there needs to be a more planned approach to encouraging entrepreneurship within such coastal communities.

This investigation represents an initial excursion into the public mind regarding the acceptability of buzz marketing techniques. One hundred thirty-one participants evaluated scenarios descriptive of actual live buzz campaigns varying in degree of transparency and deception. More negative perceptions were associated with deceptive approaches (disclosed and secret) than overt ones, and participants were less accepting of peer-to-peer campaigns than performance-to-peer campaigns. Respondents classified as moral idealists evaluated live buzz campaigns more negatively than moral relativists.

At present, the environmental issues concern more and more the competitive approach any organization can implement. Based on this approach, organizations can gain competitive advantage by managing environmental variables and by developing and implementing green marketing strategies. Considering the importance and impact of green marketing, by using theoretical concepts and defining a set of research directions, the paper and the research conducted were focused on creating a matrix model for choosing the optimal green marketing strategy, oriented towards competitive advantage. The model is based on the correlation that can be established among the generic strategies of competitive advantage, the variables of extended marketing mix (7Ps) and the green marketing strategy matrix. There are also analyzed the implications that may be generated within a company by the adoption of a green marketing strategy and its role in promoting the environmental benefits of products.",Competitive advantage; Extended marketing mix; Green marketing strategy; Matrix model; Sustainability,

While the literature has concentrated on why downstream original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and retailers become ""sustainable,"" much less is known regarding why and how upstream suppliers implement sustainability practices. Based on findings from a cross-case analysis of eight first-tier (FT) suppliers and an integration of resource dependency theory (RDT), this study explores the drivers and mechanisms of FT supplier engagement in sustainable supply chain management. Suppliers need to understand the sustainability priorities of customers and stakeholders to derive the effective focus and depth of further upstream integration with subsuppliers. Therefore, the integration between the two functions that manage the relevant external interfaces, namely marketing (downstream and stakeholder communication) and procurement (upstream), appears to be the essential cornerstone to move beyond FT supplier compliance to actual commitment to sustainability practices. We present findings on how (1) stakeholder-related, (2) process-related, and (3) product-related drivers influence the choice and effectiveness of the procurement-marketing integration (PM integration) mechanisms. Stakeholder pressures are considered to be the principal drivers of sustainability efforts. However, on their own, they rarely provide sufficient grounds for permanent and embedded PM integration initiatives at FT suppliers. Evidence suggests that suppliers' commitment to PM integration is motivated by the opportunity to leverage sustainability initiatives in their product offerings and sustainability certificates recognizable by customers and secondary stakeholders. © 2014 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.",Case study; Cross-functional integration; Resource dependence theory; Sustainability; Sustainable supply chain management,

This paper argues that the external integration moderates the influence of entrepreneurial competencies on success of SMEs businesses. Hence, the entrepreneurs should be competent enough to manage their relationships with their customers and suppliers to get competitive advantage. Only sustainable competitive advantage will ensure business survival and success. This paper adopts the resource based view of competencies (RBV) which claims that entrepreneurial competencies are valuable and intangible resources that lead towards the success of business. Entrepreneurial competencies alone are not enough to ensure the survival and success of businesses. Since, SMEs have scarce resources of finance, skills, technology and knowledge; therefore SMEs sustainable business success highly depends on many other factors such as supplier’s capabilities as well as customer’s integration. Moreover, the strong relationships of SMEs with their customers and suppliers enable them to access the information regarding latest customer choices and tastes, technologies and new methods of innovations. Therefore, this paper incorporates two theories namely, the resource dependence theory (RDT)and the resource based view (RBV) to explain the conceptual model, where RDT suggests that firms have to depend on external parties (suppliers and customers) to get critical resources for their survival. Particularly, there is a dearth of studies that have examined the influence of external integration on the relationship of entrepreneurial competencies and success of Malaysian SMEs businesses. Therefore, the current study strives to investigate the moderating impact of customer and supplier relationships on the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and success of businesses of Malaysian SMEs in the manufacturing sector.

Even though entrepreneurship does not equate to the small and medium-sized enterprises, there is strong support in literature regarding the importance of SMEs in national economies due to the authorities' potential of intervention and their contribution to gross value added. The fluctuating evolution of the Romanian business environment has led to a high volatility of its contribution to GDP, which is especially true in the case of SMEs due to their lack of technology and capital and difficult access to financing, as well as limited know-how compared to the large companies that control the Romanian market. Successful entrepreneurial initiative leads to sustainable businesses and ensures a smooth transition from business ideas to the creation of value added, thus supporting economic growth and the narrowing of macroeconomic gaps which have been generated during the economic recession. As a distinctive and dynamic component of Romanian entrepreneurship, the SME segment has a significant contribution to GDP.

Design/methodology/approach – The method is four-fold, weaving together an auto-ethnographic approach, a contextual dialogue between accounting academics and lobbyists, a Morris-inspired utopian metaphor and a stakeholder accountability event in the form of oral disclosures written as a song cycle. Findings – Current efforts at integrated reporting are unlikely to change how large companies do business in order to address the risk of climate change in the short term. If the UN reports on climate change are correct, the authors need to take immediate action. The authors argue that, instead of waiting for climatic disaster to lead to a paradigm shift in corporate practice, “monetisation” of the costs of climate change is one way to encourage integrated thinking and sustainable business models. This relies on existing finance and accounting discourse to create a new “field of environmental visibility” which engenders environmental awareness on the part of the world’s companies and policy makers. Practical implications – This utopian image may not appear a practicable, realistic solution to current problems but represents a starting point for optimism.

Combined with the unique challenges of an operating entity, this could potentially expose the profitability of sustainable businesses on a daily basis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate employees’ justice perceptions of performance management practices in a company in the chemical industry. The population includes all the employees in the chemical industry that was used in this study. A total of 140 questionnaires were issued to all the employees in an organisation which had undergone a performance appraisal and 102 respondents completed the surveys, giving a response rate of 72 per cent. A cross-sectional survey design was used in this study. The justice perceptions were measured according to an existing framework developed by Thurston and McNall (2010). The framework is founded on a hypothesised four-factor model constructed according to theories on organisational justice. The employees of the organisation in the chemical sector were involved in this study. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to measure perceptions of justice based on theories on organisational justice. The measuring instrument used was based on recognised models and theories. The study supports the construct validity of the measuring instrument and the reliability of the scales used. The justice constructs were used to identify specific items in the performance management practice that required improvement. The implications of the results are that continual interventions are required if employee commitment and productivity levels are to improve, resulting in a positive impact on business performance. Significant differences in perceptions by demographic groups were reported and discussed. This study explored the importance of understanding justice perceptions of performance management practices as an enabler for sustained business performance.

The Brundtland report of 1987 did help in setting the stage on sustainability for companies. However, in India one of the business models which lack several aspects of sustainability is e-Retail or the electronic retail. This paper outlines the need of sustainable business and also determines important parameters for sustainability of business. Further, the paper also analyses the sustainability of Indian e-retail business. The main agenda for most of the Indian e-retailers has been customer acquisition. Spending big bucks on marketing, and brand building is something which is seen round the clock 365 days a year. The aggressiveness of the e-retailers definitely makes sense in the Indian economy given the fact that the penetration of e-retail in overall retailing market in India is still in its infancy (with penetration less than 3 per cent). The companies in India are following a similar paradigm which was fooled by the global players like eBay Inc. and Amazon Inc. in the United States. Also, private equity players and venture capitalists are supporting the e-retailers by making massive investments which are purely based on base line assumption of promising future returns the business the investors would make. However, on the contrary, if the Indian e-retailers continue to offer huge discounts, they will only attract volumes thereby gaining significant market share but it would lead to un-sustainability as profitability with such deep discounts remains a distant dream. Lastly, the paper also makes a qualitative and quantitative correlation of emergence of e-retail in developed economies like US, UK along with developing economies like Brazil and Chine to that of Indian market. This correlation helped in understanding the tipping point post which a change in strategy for Indian players and increased focus on profitability will only result in sustainable business model. It is inferred from the analysis that the Indian e-retailers will have to relook their strategy and change their focus on profitability. This can be achieved by two means- one by means of cost optimisation and other by discount reduction. Cost optimisation techniques would involve reduction of cost in overheads like employee cost, fulfilment cost, payment gateway cost, logistic cost and others. This would be possible by inorganic growth route as the players have positive gross margins while negative operating margins which indicates high cost in operations. The paper outlines that the tipping point will be the ideal penetration of e-Retail in India and beyond this point players have to shift focus solely on profitability and returns. If not done, the companies won’t sustain in the market and continuous triple digit growth and whooping valuations will result in a bubble which will eventually burst. © 2015 Niraj S, et al.",Business sustainability; E-commerce; E-retail; Tipping point,

We find that teams with ""tie-hired-players"" underperform teams without tie-hired-players by 5 percent. This effect is large enough to change the composition of teams that qualify for the playoffs. Importantly, we show that adverse selection of managers and teams into the use of tie-hiring procedures cannot fully explain this finding.

To examine this problem, it draws on a presentation of the famous conception of property elaborated at the beginning of the previous century by the famous French lawyer Léon Duguit (1859-1928), and then intends to reflect on possible lessons that could be learnt from his project. Duguit, generally recalled as one of the main inventors of the notion of public service, intended a very radical critique of property on a sociological ground. His project could therefore be qualified as a pre-kelsenian socio-positivism. Drawing widely on the work of his Bordeaux colleague Émile Durkheim on the ""divison of social labor"", property should not be considered as a natural consequence of individual liberty, but, on the contrary, as part of inter-individual relationships and, eventually, of social solidarity. Hence, property should not be founded on individual free will, but on its ""social function"". This radical statement, however, cannot hide the fact that such function appears to be less an objective fact than the very expression of Duguit's claim for social justice; which explains many of the difficulties he encountered in order to define precisely what it means, how it works and by whom it should be determined. Duguit's ambitious attempt of a re-foundation of law, beyond the distinction between public and private law, thus bumps into the very uneasy articulation between facts and values. Finally, he seems to reconsider the sociological ground of the rule of law in a subjectivist light (referring to ""individual consciousness""), counterbalanced by universal conceptions of justice that can be traced back to Saint Thomas Aquinas. But this appears to be insufficient in order to define precisely a social function: consequently, his entire project tends to appear as a mere transformation of the sole justification of property, rather than as an actual limitation of it. Duguit's work, as a matter of fact, did not serve to justify the first French nationalizations, and even the modern notion of public service is only partially grounded on his views. But these limits of Duguit's project should not suffice to condemn it once and for all; on the contrary, his courageous attempt to face the problem of justification and enforcement of social justice can still be considered as a source of inspiration for social and political thinkers. The idea that property lies ultimately, not in a relation to things but on a relation between people can thus be illustrated in various ways in contemporary works in philosophy, sociology and political economy. First of all, this leads to recent attempts by André Orléan, a member of the French School of Regulation, to criticize the notion of value that can be found in standard political economy. In his view, value is to be considered not as a substantial property of goods, but as a result of the dynamics of social interactions on a given market. Consequently, appropriation, far from being the pure expression of free will, appears to be lead by unconscious social imitation. On the one hand, such analysis goes beyond Duguit's views in so far as it draws more radical conclusions of Durkheim's sociology: the actual ground of individual appropriation is not social solidarity, but social dynamics of valuation. Social interdependency does not spontaneously appear as harmonious but on the contrary, the failure of financial markets' self-regulation calls for a better involvement of State interventionism. But on the other hand, this theory appears to be not as ambitious as Duguit's, since it doesn't imply any consistent conception of social justice, nor does it reflect upon the role of law in social relationships. Thus, another and even more radical interpretation can be illustrated in recent public decisions to publically destroy massive illegal ivory stocks in order to confront the raising illegal traffic and the increase of elephant killings in Africa. Such gestures illustrate a concrete involvement of public institutions in the social dynamics of valuation. To fully understand them, one is forced to recognize their symbolical dimension, that is to say their self-attested, performative claim that these parts of animals cannot be recognized any value no more, and consequently, do not constitute goods that can be appropriated. Granted, these public destructions cannot constitute the unique way to fight illegal traffic and poaching, but they exhibit in a very pure way that the conditions of the very existence of markets and properties are not only social, but even public, and that they therefore involve political commitments. An anthropological look on modern social practices thus reveals that the search for alternative conceptions of property should also include institutional dimensions of social life. © De Boeck Supérieur.

It explicitly incorporates the moderating role of perceived self-disclosure to determine social support seeking, which is set as a key mediator in the model. The results from survey data of 407 consumers show that loneliness and life dissatisfaction are positively related to social support seeking and the relationships are strengthened by perceived self-disclosure, which in turn affects the intention to continually use social networking services.

Additionally, it examines the impact of both of these constructs on response to advertising. The confirmation of the significance of social capital gained through participation in OSNs and its impact on response to ads provides support for the notion that the relationally oriented and marketing-oriented management of OSNs are compatible. These findings are of great relevance for the appropriate management of company presence on OSNs. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Online social networks; Sociability and response to advertising; Social capital; Social status,

First was the recognition that production is a social process that enmeshes its participants in conflicted social relationships based on power. Workers and employers meet in labor markets not simply as individuals but as classes. Furthermore, labor markets are segmented systematically by race and gender. The labor process is also divided between productive and unproductive labor. In the context of social structures of accumulation, the labor process and labor markets undergo periodic qualitative changes as capitalism resolves deep crises. These understandings have contributed to challenges to the supposed link between labor productivity and wages and the claimed power of education as a force to dissolve class differences. The paper concludes with a consideration of the role of anti-communism in shaping labor studies in the United States after World War II and a critique of the supposed sharp distinction between positive and normative economics. © 2015, © 2015 Union for Radical Political Economics.",labor market; social institution; URPE history,

We put forward a classification of actions which can be considered investments in social capital, that the entrepreneur could promote. This classification should help us to understand how to influence social capital assets, especially by SMEs. These kind of firms, that are distinguished by scarcity of resources, could significantly take advantage of actual and potential resources, as well as appropriable ones, embedded in social personal relationships. The role of the entrepreneur is fundamental to promoting the creation and exploitation of collective social capital, both inside and outside the firm.

However, this distance effect appears to proxy for a social effect: it is largely explained by funders who likely have an offline social relationship with the artist (""friends and family""). Yet, this social effect does not persist past the first investment, suggesting that it may be driven by an activity like search but not monitoring.

Beyond the fact that Ostrom was the first to introduce a conceptualization of common property based on the notion of bundle of rights, a crucial point is her rejection of the ""a-temporal and a-historical perspective"" of Alchian and Demsetz's theory of property right. Ostrom explicitly affirms the political dimension of any system of property rights or rules. By political dimension, one must understand the rejection of any spontaneous, natural and individualist approach to property in favour of a view in terms of a system of rules that cannot be separated from a permanent collective action and deliberation and in terms of property rights as social relationships. The aim of this article is to highlight the contributions and limitations of Ostrom's approach to the understanding of the political dimension of property rights and institutions. Having briefly set out the research program, the foundations, the conceptual tools and the major results of this approach, I emphasize its three contributions: (1) the overcoming of the naturalistic bias in Samuelson's taxonomy of goods by the recognition of the social and political attributes of the notion of rivalry and exclusion; (2) the understanding of markets as diverse, complex and institutional construction in which collective action, law and political deliberation are present at all stages, even at the level of the definition and delimitation of the object of exchange; (3) the reflexivity of appropriators or users of common-pool resources when they have to shape and apply a system of rules. The limitations of Ostrom's approach to property and institutions concern the absence of any clear account of the nature of this political dimension. This is explained by the absence of a theory of institutional change in Ostrom's approach. It is only recently that this approach has started to deal with this issue. I show that the account of institutional change already provided is purely empirical and do not address the controversy that this issue has stimulated in several social sciences. This evasive approach to institutional change results in a weak historical view of the evolution of property rights and it undermines the ability to shape a theory that take into account the structural factors - asymmetries of power, inequality, etc. - that drive the relationships that humans have with the environment. © De Boeck Supérieur.",Diversity; Institutional change; Ostrom; Political dimension; Property rights,

It finds that today, Chinese social organizations already have a certain capacity for behaving autonomously, the capacity for endorsement, and the capacity for public service. At the same time, there are imbalances in the development of the capacities of different types of social organizations. To build social organizations, there should be a full range of diagnostics regarding their capacities, relevant legal guidelines, concentration of resources to optimize their capacity structures, enlargement of their capacity reserves, and the endeavor to propel social organizations to play a greater role in social development and social management. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",advocacy; autonomy; legal capacity; service,

The question is whether reintegration policies aiming at their return to – a fulltime – job should consider individual social network factors besides psychological and human capital factors. The purpose of this paper is to investigate welfare recipients’ job search behaviour, in particular how individual social capital is distributed, and whether it is related to job search activities. Design/methodology/approach – Standardised and structured interviews were conducted with 189 long-term unemployed welfare recipients. An adapted version of the Resource Generator instrument was used to measure individual access to social capital. Findings – Social capital scales measuring domestic social resources, status-related social resources, expert advice on regulations and financial matters, and advice on finding a job were developed and psychometrically tested. Status-related social resources were more easily accessible to men and higher educated persons. Advice on finding a job was more easily accessible to recently unemployed individuals. Domestic social resources were less accessible to ethnic minorities. Persons with more social capital, specifically status-related social resources and advice in finding a job, showed more active job search behaviour. Social implications – The differences in job search activities between respondents with more social capital and those with less social capital were present but to a small degree, and therefore there is no argument for reintegration activities to focus on enlarging social capital.

We argue that CSP activities affect these two reputations differently. In addition, we empirically test the relationship among different types of CSP, reputation among public and financial stakeholders, and financial performance. Our results suggest that (1) Carroll’s four types of CSP (i.e., economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic) affect financial performance differently, and (2) their effects are mediated by reputation among public and financial stakeholders.

This paper introduces a dynamic social network analysis framework in which this spread is conceptualized as the result of the reactions of perpetrators, victims, and observers to an initial act of unethical behavior. This theoretical framework shows that the social relationships of the actors involved in an initial act impact in multiple ways the likelihood that unethical behavior spreads. It reveals furthermore that social relationships may change in the wake of unethical behavior, such that indirect negative consequences can arise for organizations. The proposed framework provides a basis for the development of a formal stochastic actor-oriented model of network dynamics which would enable simulations of the spread of unethical behavior. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Contagion; Misconduct; Social network analysis; Spread; Unethical behavior,

Based on an exploration of the fact/value dichotomy and the pragmatist and virtue theoretic responses to it, we develop an approach to eliminating the separation thesis that integrates “business” with “ethics” while still permitting a positive/normative distinction, which we call “ethics from observation.” © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Fact/value dichotomy; Positive/normative distinction; Separation thesis; Virtue theory,

We collected data from 452 boundary spanning salespeople using multiple sources. Results demonstrate that a formative model of Coping Intelligence (CI) is superior to a reflective model and that problem-focused coping contributes to CI which, in turn, is related to affective and normative commitment. Further, our more parsimonious formative model illustrates that positive problem-focused coping and negative emotion-focused coping contribute to both affective and normative commitment. After controlling for gender and salespeople’s commission (from company’s personnel record) in separate analyses, results remain significant. We provide additional insights: Females are likely to use emotion-focused coping than males, but gender is not related to organizational commitment. Salespeople’s commission is positively related to both affective and normative commitment but unrelated to coping strategies. We shed new lights on boundary spanning employees’ Coping Intelligence and organizational commitment and offer theoretical, empirical, and practical implications to coping strategies and business ethics. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Action-focused; Affective; Boundary spanning; Continuance; Coping intelligence; Coping strategies; Emotion-focused; Ethics; Gender; Normative; Organizational commitment; Problem-focused; Sales commission; Stress,

The managerial action as a result of such strategic cognition suggests that modern organizations are seeking to develop CSR giving processes that provide them with a competitive advantage. We draw on the resource-based view of organizations and the VRIO framework to provide the theoretical foundations for our argument that CSR implementation in the form of corporate giving to charities can be developed as a dynamic capability. This can provide a competitive advantage by allowing organizations to manage key stakeholder relationships (external and internal) more effectively with benefits which could lead to increased organizational productivity and the ability to execute strategy more effectively. We interview CSR implementation managers from large organizations in Australia and find that the CSR giving process in many firms is evolving into a more sophisticated and strategically motivated process with expectations of a return. Central to this evolution is the appointment of a CSR implementation manager who acts as a boundary spanner between the organization and its key stakeholders. We posit that this corporate investment in their role and supporting structures can lead to the better management of stakeholders by organizations through the dynamic capability of the CSR giving process. We develop a table of best practise to help guide managers entering this sphere. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate philanthropy; CSR; CSR giving; Dynamic capability; Giving manager; Issue salience; RBV; Stakeholder management; Stakeholders; VRIO,

Extant research demonstrates that CR is one of the key mediators between CSR and important organizational outcomes, which ultimately improve organizational performance. Yet, hitherto the research focused on CR construct has been plagued by multiple definitions, conflicting conceptualizations, and unclear operationalizations. The purpose of this article is to provide theoretical ground for positioning of CR as an assessment construct that is modeled as a second-order factor affecting individual first-order dimensions (having a reflective nature), and to provide methodological and empirical support toward such conceptualization. We assert that intangible, socially complex, and causally ambiguous CR (latent construct) can be accurately estimated through its individual measurable dimensions. Using survey data from Peru, we empirically test the hypothesized second-order reflective model within a hierarchy of nested and non-nested models, and compare its model fit and predictive power (nomological validity) with alternative conceptualizations. Modeling CR as a second-order reflective construct relies on a set of theoretical propositions and yields several methodological advantages, including strong conceptual interpretability and parsimony when tested within a nomological context. We explicitly demonstrate positive organizational outcomes of CR: customer trust, corporate identification, in-role behavior, and extra-role behavior. Then, we demonstrate that the shorter scales of CR can be used as a good proxy for the full construct measure. The paper concludes by highlighting theoretical insights, and methodological and managerial implications of the findings. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate identification; Corporate reputation; Extra-role behavior; In-role behavior; Organizational reputation; Reflective versus formative construct; Trust,

Many of these dilemmas concern the capital that is generated (or the lack of it) through variations in the use of ethnic stakeholder social ties. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a stakeholder-based model of social capital formation, mediated by various forms of ethnic ties, to explore the duality of ethnicity: it can aid and hinder an ethnic business. Drawing upon the social capital/economic development, stakeholder salience, ethnic businesses literatures, and (to some extent) on social identity theory, we develop a cyclical model of relationships among ethnic business stakeholder attributes (ethnic kinship-based power, ethnic-moral legitimacy, and ethnic-critical urgency) and social capital, as mediated by three-way (triadic) Simmelian bonding and bridging ties, which then, in turn, affects the ethnic stakeholder attributes. We argue that the development of bridging yet strong ties through this cyclical process is relevant for the improvement of the positions of ethnic businesses in terms of both economic success and social responsibility. Specifically, we suggest that, given the duality of ethnicity in business, managers can prioritize stakeholder relationships based upon how these stakeholder ties affect social capital. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Ethnic business; Ethnic-based social dilemmas; Simmelian ties; Social capital; Stakeholder salience,

However, relationships between stakeholders are given relatively little attention, the various groups theoretically encompassed by the term “community” remain relatively undefined, and other marginalized stakeholders often go unrecognized. MSD and CIT can enable us to conceptualize the stakeholder model more clearly, to develop research projects that more adequately capture the dynamic quality of stakeholder relationships, to tailor management strategies to particular stakeholder characteristics, and to understand corporate social responsibility messages. As an example, stakeholder theory, combined with MSD and CIT, is applied to California’s cannabis/marijuana industry. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Cannabis; CIT; Communication theory; Communications; Community; Community infrastructure theory; Marginalized stakeholders; Marijuana; Media systems dependency; MSD; Stakeholder perspective; Stakeholder theory; Storytelling,

They all lead to reports confirming the overall relatively low proportion of women on boards and the slow pace at which more women are being appointed. Furthermore, the proportion of women on corporate boards varies much across countries. Based on institutional theory, this study hypothesizes and tests whether this variation can be attributed to differences in cultural settings across countries. Our analysis of the representation of women on boards for 32 countries during 2010 reveals that two cultural characteristics are indeed associated with the observed differences. We use the cultural dimensions proposed by Hofstede (Culture’s consequences: International differences in work-related values, 1980) to measure this construct. Results show that countries which have the greatest tolerance for inequalities in the distribution of power and those that tend to value the role of men generally exhibit lower representations of women on boards. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Board of directors; Corporate governance; Cross-country; Culture; Diversity; Gender; Gender diversity,

His approach to Sufism, combining an interpretation of revelation with reason, can contribute to new developments in business ethics (BE) scholarship and practice especially in Muslim communities. His thought portrays a vibrant work ethic that, while based in Sufism, has important practical implications for business.

Guided by institutional theory as a theoretical framework and social constructionism as a philosophical stance, this study uses a qualitative, interview-based methodology. Capitalizing on in-depth, face-to-face interviews with Muslim Arab women entrepreneurs across four countries in the Arab Middle East region, the results portray how Islamic work values and ethics are embedded in the entrepreneurial activities of these Arab women. The results also illustrate how Muslim women entrepreneurs seek well-being (falah) in their life and excellence (itqan) in their work while running their businesses. The Muslim women entrepreneurs adhered to the Islamic work-related values of good and hard work (amal salih), honesty and truthfulness (sidik and amanah), fairness and justice (haqq and adl), and benevolence (ihsaan) and perceived them as instrumental to the survival and success of their enterprises. The agency of the Muslim Arab women allowed them to construct and navigate their entrepreneurial careers away from the traditional, doctrinaire interpretations of Islam. This study, therefore, contributes to theory development on the interrelationship between gender and business ethics within entrepreneurial contexts and in relation to Muslim values. It also contributes to studies on entrepreneurship and business ethics by showing how Arab women practice entrepreneurship and project their faith in their enterprises.

For him, the conceptions of the local community and its normative framework, of the enterprise, and of the individuals within it need to be aligned with each other and developed together. Over time, four processes have, however, led to a widening gap between the business world and the local community. These are (1) the dissemination of the corporate model, (2) the transformation of the entrepreneurial role toward an agency role, (3) changes in the ownership structure, and (4) changes in the relation to the local community. This article presents Smith’s integrative conception of business and its contributions to the development of integrative theories of organizations and of business–society relations in the twenty-first century. Among others, it discusses the necessity to develop a normative-relational dimension of organizations that addresses the relations between the organization, its members (e.g., owners and managers), and the normative framework of the local community.

I examine Google’s decision to enter the Chinese search engine market as an example of such a conflict. I consider the view that Google’s managers engaged in justifiable moral compromise in making the choice to engage in self-censorship and show how this view depends on the idea of genuine moral dilemmas or irresolvable moral conflicts. I argue that there are serious reasons to doubt the existence of genuine moral dilemmas both in the abstract, as well as in the context of managerial responsibility.

The account contains two conditions for permissibly contributing to another party’s failure to live up to their moral responsibilities. The first condition is that the manager must intend and act in such a way as to minimize the firm’s complicity in the other entity or actor’s failure, which in most cases will imply a duty for the manager to take actions that aim towards changing the institutional context. Under the second condition, managers ought to communicate to the firm’s constituents that they take seriously the importance of the interests at stake. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate responsibility; Dirty hands; Human rights; Intentionality; Managerial responsibility; Moral conflict; Moral dilemmas,

Traditional project valuation methods attempt to monetize the benefit and cost impacts of environmental and social impacts. Monetizing costs and benefits of environmental and social goods and services however is challenging. To avoid the need to assign a priori dominance to any of these capital forms, we derive a composite index formed as an aggregate of sub-indices that represent financial returns, environmental impacts and social effects, index weights are obtained through solving a series of data envelopment analysis optimization models from a set of sub-indices over each project’s life. We assess the reliability and robustness of this approach using a portfolio of corporate projects. The sustainability of each project is benchmarked against the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ performing project within the portfolio so that weights of the component indices are derived using only the portfolio data. This approach ranks projects according to the optimal trade-off between sustainable outcomes without the need to arbitrarily prescribe weights to ensure environmental or social outcomes are met. The design of the model naturally favors projects that adequately address the full spectrum of economic, environmental, social, and any other desirable factors relative to the portfolio of projects under assessment.

Drawing on stakeholder theory, we develop hypotheses about (a) market investor reaction to the disclosure of new, relevant corporate environmental performance in both the short and longer (6–12-month) term, (b) whether market investors’ reaction reflects industry context, and (c) whether firm-level contextual variables representing firm size, and market legitimacy significantly impacts the investor reaction. We find that, for the sample of the largest 500 US firms ranked by Newsweek, investors react positively both to the raw and within-industry rankings of green performance in terms of both short-term and longer-term (up to 12 months) returns. Moreover, the investor reaction is significantly influenced by contextual variables such as firm size and firm market legitimacy. Our results are compatible with the inference that rating agencies like Newsweek serve a valuable information dissemination function such that investors in better ranked firms anticipate larger future cash flows due to more positive reactions from key stakeholders such as environmentally-conscious customers, employees, NGOs, regulators, and thus reward these firms with stock price increases. Finally, larger, more visible firms benefit more, while firms which have more market legitimacy (represented by past financial performance) benefit less. We believe these findings will be of considerable interest to scholars of environmental corporate social responsibility. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Corporate sustainability; Legitimacy; Newsweek Green Rankings; Stakeholder management; Stock market performance,

This paper proposes an educational strategy to overcome the philosophical confusions about relativism in which business people and students are often trapped. First, the paper provides some conceptual distinctions and clarifications related to moral relativism, particularism, and virtue ethics. More particularly, it revisits arguments demonstrating that virtues in business are not in contradiction with the relevance of universal principles, despite the fact that virtue ethics is often identified with particular relationships and contexts. It goes on to show how students and managers, but also researchers, often mix up radically different conceptions of moral relativism. It is also argued that this confusion is in part created by the cross-cultural management literature in which the methodological stance of the value-freedom of the social sciences is, in a perplexingly mistaken way, transformed into a rejection of all normative discussion and a plea for relativism. The remainder of the paper presents some tools that may be helpful in steering people toward less simplistic views about moral relativism and virtue ethics. It further argues that it is equally important to spell out that moral universalism can be understood in a humble way, without implying either arrogant ethnocentrism or omniscience, as part of an ongoing debate that progresses gradually. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Cross-cultural management; Moral relativism; Universalism; Virtues,

Stakeholders for and against the mine reviewed the mining partnership's environmental baseline study data but did not reach consensus on whether risks posed to the salmon fishery were too great. Anglo American left the partnership, and the Pebble Dialogue was not completed. The final planned phase of the dialogue involved collaborative community-company mine planning in what would have been a high-impact mechanism of CSR, but negotiations of the risks and benefits to stakeholders did not take place. The mining project has not achieved social license, although the Pebble Dialogue offers some components that should be considered in future public engagement exercises. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",CSR; Pebble Mine; Social license; Stakeholder engagement,Deposits; Gold deposits; Molybdenum deposits; Baseline studies; Collaborative community; CSR; License to operate; Mining companies; Public engagement; Social license; Stakeholder engagement; Fisheries; copper; gold; headwater; mine; mining; molybdenum; ore deposit; stakeholder; Alaska; Bristol Bay; United States

It examines also whether socially responsible and Islamic investments offer an additional opportunity for domestic investors to diversify their portfolios. Empirical results show that ethical investment ethical investment has inferior performance compared with their unscreened benchmarks. Moreover, using cointegration analysis, empirical results show the absence of long-run relationship between Islamic and conventional indices which offer new potential for portfolio diversification in local markets. However, there exist a long-run relationship between SR indices and their conventional counterparts. In the other hand, cointegration tests show that Islamic and socially responsible indices have long-run relationship only for FTSE indices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Business ethics; Islamic investment; Performance measurement; Social responsibility investing (SRI),
"Suh Y., Seol H., Bae H., Park Y.",Eco-efficiency based on social performance and its relationship with financial performance: A cross-industry analysis of South Korea Suh et al. Eco-efficiency and financial performance,,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84916880437&partnerID=40&md5=0006dda14469252d38dda344ee73a8d2,"Summary: As corporate responsibility for environmental management has gained attention, eco-efficiency has become recognized as an important concept for improving the social performance of the business sector as well as that of the public sector. Improving eco-efficiency is widely accepted not only as a means of increasing economic value, but also as a means of reducing environmental effects. However, managing for eco-efficiency should take into consideration the differences among industries, because the impact of eco-efficiency on financial and social performance varies among industries. To explore this variation, we conducted a cross-industry analysis of eco-efficiency based on social performance using data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA measures relative efficiency and is a useful tool for taking into account the relative importance of industry-specific characteristics. Using DEA, eco-efficiency scores were derived based on the ratio of two factors of social performance: (1) value-added inducing and production-inducing economic spillover effects and (2) the amount of greenhouse gases emitted and energy used. Then, we identified the relationships between our eco-efficiency score and financial performance, which is a measure of the firm's stability. The case study is based on 272 firms in 16 industries in South Korea. Results show that firms in product manufacturing and service-intensive industries tend to have higher eco-efficiency scores than those in raw material or chemical-intensive industries. In addition, most of the industries reveal no relationship between traditional financial performance metrics and eco-efficiency scores. A handful of industries had significant relationships with one or more financial performance metrics; in some cases, these relationships were negative, whereas in others they were positive. Surprisingly, almost all industries have no significant relationships between eco-efficiency and financial performance. This result implies that government support for policies that reward firms that attempt to be eco-efficient are needed, or that other nonfinancial metrics that influence eco-efficiency, such as employment and brand reputation, should be considered. This article is expected to support policy makers as they formulate industry-specific environmental strategies. © 2014 by Yale University.",Data envelopment analysis; Eco-efficiency; Financial performance; Industrial ecology; Input-output analysis; Social performance,Data envelopment analysis; Economic analysis; Environmental management; Finance; Greenhouse gases; Eco-efficiency; Financial performance; Industrial ecology; Input output analysis; Social performance; Efficiency

This is explored through the case study of British Sugar, which, at the time of writing, is the UK's largest sugar producer by market share. Over the past three decades, the company has systematically sought opportunities to turn waste streams and emissions from their core production processes into useful and positive inputs to new product lines. Their core business is still sugar, but the business model has evolved to offer a broad range of additional synergistic and profitable product lines, including animal feed, electricity, tomatoes, and bioethanol. The research explores the temporal dimension of dynamic business model innovation, framing it in the context of a continuous evolutionary process rather than a discrete design activity. The case will be of interest as an additional contribution to the growing literature on IS; in offering an approach for linking the themes of IE literature and sustainable business model innovation more concretely in research and practice; and, by presenting the case as an evolutionary innovation process, the article furthers the emerging literature on business model innovation for sustainability. © 2014, Yale University.",Business model innovation; Competitive advantage; Industrial ecology; Industrial symbiosis; Sustainability; Value creation,Business model innovation; Competitive advantage; Industrial ecology; Industrial symbiosis; Value creation; Sustainable development; Lycopersicon esculentum
