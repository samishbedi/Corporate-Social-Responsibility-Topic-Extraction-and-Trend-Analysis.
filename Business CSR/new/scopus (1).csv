While this case is not from one of the BRIC countries, it does take place in a large developing world country, and it does illustrate very clearly some of the legal and/or ethical dilemmas faced by multinational businesspeople and companies (especially U.S. and/or U.K companies and businesspeople) in developing world markets. The case is appropriate for senior-level undergraduates as well as students in MBA and Executive Development programs. It is designed to be taught in a one hour and a half class session, and is likely to require at least a couple hours of preparation by students;. Mr. Mike Adams is Vice President and General Manager of Pandora Investments Wurundi Inc., the Wurundian subsidiary (Wurundi is a real country in Africa and Pandora is a real company; for purposes of this case study, however, both the country and the company must remain disguised) of a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listed U.S. multinational company called Pandora Investments Group, Inc. While it is listed on the NYSE, Pandora Investments Group has very substantial operations in the UK. Pandora Investments Wurundi, Inc. (hence, PIWI) recently completed (under a contract valued at approximately $2,000,000) a gas transportation network code for the parastatal company in Wurundi called Gasco Wurundi Ltd. (hence, GWL). GWL's role in Wurundi includes creating the hard and soft infrastructure needed to move natural gas around the country. While all the key stakeholders (management of GWL, management of PIWI, etc.) agree that PIWI has successfully completed the gas transportation network code project and that all the work done by PIWI and its consultants has been truly world-class, GWL has not yet paid PIWI for its work. Earlier today, a senior executive at GWL (his name is Mr. Jonas Adorande) indicated to Adams that before he (that is, Adorande) signs off on the project (one of the required steps in GWL's payment process), Adams will need to give him (in unmarked bank notes) approximately $50,000. Additional data and information in the case include:. 1. Regarding the project: an explanation of what a gas transportation network code is, and why a country having natural gas needs one. 2. Regarding the company (PIWI): Because PIWI has in the past operated extremely successfully in a very challenging developing world market (that is, Wurundi), information is provided on PIWI's business model plus the company's past and current performance and factors impacting that performance over the years. 3. Regarding the Wurundian parastatal (that is, PIWI's customer): Background information, current performance, and factors impacting that performance. 4. Regarding Wurundi: Like China and India and some other developing world markets, even during the current economic crisis, the economy of Wurundi has continued to grow vigorously. To give students a sense of the opportunities available in the developing world, a bit of information is provided on the country disguised as Wurundi and the performance of that country's economy over the last several years. 5. Regarding US and UK laws regarding the overseas behavior of US and UK corporations and executives: Summaries of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act, plus implications of those acts for U.S and U.K. companies and businesspeople operating overseas, are provided.

Then, we investigate whether the mounting attention to CSR due to certain events has marginal effects on MSP, and whether CSR and MSP affect firms' market performances. Collectively, we find that: 1) firms' CSR levels significantly affect MSP and can substitute the governance role of minority shareholders to some extent; 2) exogenous shocks related to CSR can significantly affect MSP; and 3) firms with higher CSR level and lower MSP enjoy higher market value improvements. In addition, we find limited evidence that institutional investors may face conflict-of-interest pressures and vote against individual investors.

The authors analyze whether the proposals of associative learning theory, attribution theory, and persuasive communication are adequate to anticipate CSR image in a banking services context. A causal model is positively tested that allows the researchers to anticipate CSR image based on three variables: the coherence between the company and its CSR policy, the attribution of altruistic motivations for the company to implement CSR activities, and corporate credibility in developing CSR initiatives. Two new contributions to literature are made. First, the process is accepted in a context where CSR is a broad corporate strategy that includes significantly more initiatives than just cause-related marketing or the sponsorship of social causes. Second, the role of both company-CSR coherence and altruistic motivations is better explained in this article.

Two contemporary approaches for user-influencing design, ""Persuasive Technology"" and ""Nudge,"" are discussed against the background of social engagement in the history of design. What can be learned from the past? The most explicit but also contested examples of improving people's lives by means of design can be found in movements of ""utopian design."" We discuss the utopian aspirations in Arts and Crafts, New Objectivity, Gute Form, and Postmodernism. The major lesson to be learned is that it is necessary to find a way out of the repeated ethical dilemma between coercing human behavior on the one hand and fostering human freedom on the other. Following Michel Foucault, we will conceptualize freedom not as the absence of influences on people, but as a practice of shaping one's life in interaction with these influences. User-influencing design methods can help to prolong the tradition of socially engaged design, with tempered, non-utopian goals, but at the same time with improved understanding and more effective tools concerning how technology mediates our existence. © 2013 Dorrestijn & Verbeek.","Design for wellbeing; Ethics; Freedom; Nudge; Persuasive technology; User-influencing technology; Utopian design",,"Dorrestijn, S.; Department of Industrial Design, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands; email: s.dorrestijn@utwente.nl",,,19913761,,,,"English","Int.

What are the relevant and responsible contributions that corporations are expected to provide in support of defining solutions to sustainability issues? This paper shows how corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a negotiation process to help corporations manage uncertainties through collaborative work and alignment with stakeholders. From that angle, CSR is a process that generates standard and acceptable business practices. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses both an adductive as well as an interpretative approach of CSR and looks at CSR as a collaborative process that builds rules and norms. Findings: CSR is defined as a contractual process between stakeholders in order to drive decision making processes and agree on commitments between business and society. Interestingly, all studied examples depict the development of standard and acceptable business practices with very little involvement of stakeholders, which is not the understood way of driving changes to business strategy as defined by the CSR negotiation processes. Practical implications: A framework is presented linking CSR business practices research findings to empirical market isomorphism. The paper is of practical relevance for management practitioners. The limitations of recent research are also discussed. Originality/value: Our examples show that CSR is no more than the achievements of fragmented initiatives led by companies showing limited transparency toward external stakeholders. There is no overall coordination.

Design/methodology/approach: Validated scale measures were presented in a cross-sectional field study survey of 201 respondents.

Findings: Customer dissatisfaction with the microfinance product, lack of commitment from lender's staff, and dissatisfaction with informational support, were all significantly related to future purchase intentions. Only dissatisfaction toward the firm's people was significantly related to perceptions of CSR. Practical implications: Dissatisfied poor would prefer to buy elsewhere, even if they find the seller to be socially responsible. However, attitudes and behaviors of the firm's agents convey low CSR. Microfinance customers were sensitive to customer service. Service quality was also significantly related to their perceptions of CSR. Originality/value: This exploratory research is novel, examining stakeholders at the bottom of the pyramid. Indian respondents came from the origins of microfinance, and are seldom sampled.

They capacitate firms to govern numerous supplier relationships simultaneously toward ethical business conduct. Since many actors nowadays pursue the goal of ethical supplier management, a cascade of codes has emerged. However, this plurality poses multiple problems on its own account, such as lacking effectiveness of some of these codes, restrictions on the development of universally accepted ethical standards, and greenwashing. It also creates operational difficulties and unnecessary procedural costs for firms and is thus inefficient. The aggregated amount of issues suggests the development of a standardized supplier code of ethics as a remedy. Based on diffusion of innovation theory as theoretical lense and as conceptual support, we employ a multi-method research design to develop a design concept for such a standard. We begin with a content analysis of relevant scientific literature on content, adoption, and effectiveness of codes of ethics, in which we also study numerous extant codes and initiatives. It leads to six propositions on key success factors of a standardized supplier code of ethics. We then amend a design science approach to develop a design concept for such a standard that complies with these requirements, with the support of corporate experts from Germany, China, and India. Our results are informative about the content of a standardized supplier code of ethics, and we propose multiple effectiveness- and diffusion-facilitating mechanisms as additional components in the overall design concept.

First, we find that firms with better performance, higher R&D intensity, better financial health, and firms in new economy industries are more likely to engage in CSR activities, while riskier firms are less likely to do so. We also find U-shaped relation between firm size and CSR, indicating that either very small or very large firms exhibit high levels of CSR strengths and concerns. Next, we find that firms' CSR strengths relate favorably with their investments, organizational strategy, and performance, whereas CSR concerns and firm attributes are by and large negatively related. Using a 2SLS procedure, we verify that the CSR-performance relation is robust to corrections for endogeneity through reverse causation and/or biases introduced by time varying omitted variables. Finally, we find that the CSR-firm attributes relation is strengthened when the CEO's incentives are below the sample median, suggesting that CSR participation is especially important when monetary incentives are lower than benchmark levels. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Firm performance; Investment policy; Organizational strategy",,"Erhemjamts, O.; Bentley University, Waltham, MA, 02452, United States; email: oerhemjamts@bentley.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

This result implies that using interactive channels to communicate about CSR can improve corporate reputation.

Second, we highlight that, within social media-augmented 'public arenas of citizenship', individual citizens are empowered, relative to corporations and their (functional/formally organized) stakeholders, when it comes to creating, debating, and publicizing, CSR-relevant issues. Third, we posit that information and communication technology corporations possess specific, and potentially very important, capacities, when it comes to creating, or helping construct, public arenas of citizenship from within which individual citizens can influence their broader political-economic environment.

Indeed, the blame is sometimes placed on the corporate legal form, which can exacerbate the tension between duties to shareholders and interests of stakeholders. In comparison, the Benefit Corporation (BC) is a new legal business entity that is obligated to pursue public benefit in addition to the responsibility to return profits to shareholders. It is legally a for-profit, socially obligated, corporate form of business, with all the traditional corporate characteristics combined with societal responsibilities. Considering the history and perception of shareholder primacy in United States law, it is argued that this new business structure is an ethical step toward empowering socially committed commercial entities. The contribution of this research is to provide a fundamental base of knowledge about the new legal form of business, the BC, upon which further study may rely. First, the legal history of the corporation is briefly reviewed in order to provide context to the relationship of the corporate form to society, including exploration of the premise that shareholder wealth maximization is its best and only purpose. Second, the BC is described in detail, and state statutes are compared. Third, the BC is placed within the context of corporate social responsibility.

To that aim, we use a sample of 100 Peruvian exporting firms from several sectors and a methodology consisting of partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results reveal that, while acquiring and holding international certifications as well as the investments carried out in actions related to corporate social responsibility do not have positive effects on the performance of entrepreneurial foreign activities of Peruvian SMNEs, green management exerts a positive influence. Therefore, environmental management is revealed as an effective tool to help firms from developing countries compete successfully in the markets and, in turn, improve the economic situation in those regions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Corporate social responsibility; Entrepreneurial foreign activities; Green management; International certifications; Peruvian firms",,"Peña-Vinces, J.

In a country with more people living with HIV/AIDS than in any other nation (UNAIDS 2007), prevention and treatment is critical. HIV/AIDS is seen to be threatening the communities in which businesses are functioning and is further threatening the business itself. This article examines the moral and social responsibility of the corporate sector in its effort to deal with the issue of HIV/AIDS. Big business leaders have recognized the threat of HIV/AIDS to the workplace and have positioned responses towards the disease from an ethical, legal and cost-effective business perspective; however the response from small to medium businesses is relatively weak.

The model suggests that CSR, CS, and ethics are parts of the same organizational subsystem, shaped by a complex interaction between human capital, individual moral development, habitus (mindsets, dispositions), organizational practices and culture, and external situational factors. The generative mechanism, or motor, driving the development and change of organizational culture, consists of power relationships that are shaped by specific figurations of various types of human capital (social, cultural, economic, and symbolic).

Survey data from 245 full-time employees (Study 2) further supported the interactive effects revealed in Study 1. Specifically, first-party justice perceptions attenuated the positive relationship between employees' CSR perceptions and their organizational citizenship behavior (OCB); and the relationship between CSR perceptions and OCB was more pronounced among employees high (versus low) in moral identity.

Companies try to cope with societal demands by integrating them into these business operations: (1) integrating societal demands into project management by initiating a project in an area that is perceived as 'good'; (2) avoid 'bad things' by applying quality management for CSR implementation; (3) strategic CSR perceives societal demands as opportunities to create shared value and (4) transformational CSR helps to overcome constraints like low materiality and developing the capabilities of a company. While the first two stages aim at 'doing good' or 'avoiding bad', strategic and transformational CSR are key for 'being successful'. Based on extended literature review and well-documented studies, our referential framework offers insights into underlying patterns, potentials and limitations of linking CSR to business operations. Companies can assess the stage they have reached, strive for higher materiality, boost their competitiveness, and evolve in terms of CSR maturity. Hence, the referential framework adds a new and application-oriented perspective to the discussion of the business case for CSR and demonstrates how stages lead to competitive advantage and organizational transformation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","CSR business case; organizational learning; project management; quality management; responsible competitiveness; Social responsibility of business; stage model; strategic management",,"Martinuzzi, A.; Institute for Managing Sustainability, Vienna University of Economics and BusinessAustria; email: andre.martinuzzi@wu.ac.at",,,14697017,,,,"English","J.

Over the years, the company has built up a vast distribution network and today its products are sold in more than 800 franchise stores and in over 4,000 other points of sale across Europe and Asia. The Jack Wolfskin brand has enjoyed growing popularity among outdoor enthusiasts and, as a result, the company's sales have grown at highly creditable rates over the past ten years. Not surprisingly, the company has attracted the attention of several private equity firms, and in 2011 it was purchased by Blackstone Group-one of the largest of these firms-as the latter saw the company's potential for future growth. The key to this growth lies in international expansion. This is already well under way, as is evidenced by the company's penetration into the South American market and franchise negotiations in more established markets in Europe and Asia. It is noteworthy that the company is aiming to achieve its expansion goals while simultaneously following a rigorous corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda-which involves the elimination and replacement of chemicals routinely used by makers of outdoor apparel, including fluorocarbons for waterproof breathable garments. In meeting this agenda, the company will no doubt have to overhaul its current supply chain as it develops alternative production methods which are more environmentally friendly-and this is likely to result in higher costs. Nonetheless, the company is cautiously optimistic about its financial prospects, not least because it enjoys a solid position in a market which has good potential for growth. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2013.",,"Blackstone; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Current supplies; International expansion; Outdoor clothing; Private equity firms; Production methods; Industry; Investments; Supply chains; Commerce",,,,02684764,,,,"English","Text.

We examined CSR scores for Canadian firms listed only on Canadian stock exchanges and for Canadian firms crosslisted on U.S. exchanges. During this period, our analysis shows an overall decrease in CSR scores for all Canadian firms in our sample, and for both our subsamples of firms: Canadian firms cross-listed on U.S. stock exchanges and Canadian firms listed only on Canadian exchanges. Our analysis suggests that as a result of increased scrutiny facilitated by the regulatory changes, CSR disclosures become more transparent and comprehensive: CSR Strengths and CSR Weaknesses Scores both declined after 2002 resulting in an overall decline in Total CSR scores.

Drawing on data gathered from France's largest listed companies - members of the CAC 40 - we provide insights into the structures and processes that companies employ to design, implement and monitor their CSR strategy. In doing so, we provide evidence of the way that organizations seek to attain their CSR objectives, and of the relationship between the management of CSR and other business processes. Of particular interest is the role of the levers of control in enabling managers to identify and manage threats and opportunities associated with CSR strategy, thus forming risk management processes that support organizations in their attainment of strategic objectives. Furthermore, the study provides evidence suggesting the use of MCS has the potential to contribute to society's broader sustainability agenda through processes that enable innovation, communication, reporting, and the identification of threats and opportunities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate Social Responsibility; CSR strategy; Levers of control; Management control systems; Sustainability",,"Arjaliès, D.-L.; Accounting and Control Department, HEC Paris, 1 rue de la Libération, 78351 Jouy-en-Josas, France; email: arjalies@hec.fr",,,10445005,,,,"English","Manage.

It is argued that retailers, through their marketing and social responsibility strategies, evolve into promoters of a healthy lifestyle at both social and individual levels. The selected examples from Poland illustrate how food retailers, particularly fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) retailers, respond to the healthy lifestyle desideratum within an emerging economy. Methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is taken. The role and potential activities of retailers to promote a healthy lifestyle are identified by theoretical studies. Then, retailers' involvement in developing the 'health and wellness' market segment as a market opportunity is justified by analyses of competitive trends in Polish retailing. The marketing and corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of leading Polish retailers (representatives of different organisational forms) contributing to the development of a healthy lifestyle are presented. Data are drawn from companies' web pages, interviews, magazines and research agencies. Findings: Recent experience in Poland confirms the finding from previous research that the retail sector in emerging economies is rapidly progressing towards catching up with well-established practices in developed countries. On the demand side, this process is fostered by the rise of middle-class consumers, while on the supply side, the key driver is the fierce competition among international chains and domestic distributors. Practical implications: Examples drawn from Polish retailing represent good business practices, the relevance of which stretches beyond their local context and renders these business practices shareable. Social implications: Awareness is raised of the importance of progressing towards a healthy lifestyle; pragmatic advice is provided on how retailers from an emerging economy can enable changes in consumers' behaviour. Originality/value: The business focus on healthy lifestyle development fills a knowledge gap since health science perspectives still prevail in mainstream research on the topic. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Healthy lifestyle; Organic food; Polish market; Retail trade; Structural changes",,"Śmigielska, G.; Department of Trade and Market Institutions, Cracow University of Economics, Rakowicka, Krakow, Poland","Renko S.Knezevic B.",,1876066X,9781781908327,,,"English","Int.

The relationship between nascent entrepreneurs' intentions to exploit learning and the extent of a profit-first mentality is examined. The study utilises data from 257 nascent entrepreneurs participating in a business start-up programme. Structural equation modelling is used to test a series of hypotheses which examine links between sustainability education and nascent entrepreneurs' attitudes. The results indicate a strong relationship between perception of learning benefits and intentions of nascent entrepreneurs to exploit those benefits. Although a profit-first mentality is negatively related to perceptions of benefit, learning itself is not affected.

Contrary to simplistic expectations, Korea shows a concern for short-termism more than for sustainability; and a normative more than a strategic orientation in its CSR, where CSR lies at a crossroads between implicit and explicit CSR behavior. The practices reflect many Korean institutional factors, but not in simple and direct ways. Institutional factors interact in intricate ways to create complex and dynamic pressures for CSR practice.

A bivariate probit model, estimated to explain the different types of technological innovations (product and/or process), shows that firms with strategic CSR profiles are more likely to innovate in both products and processes. In contrast, adopting responsive CSR practices significantly alters firms' innovation, such that CSR may create barriers to innovation.

The understanding of CSR has evolved since then and its scope has now broadened from mere compliance to corporate laws to active alignment of internal business goals with externally set societal aspirations. Unfortunately, the significance of this multidimensional concept within the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector has continued to be overshadowed by its application in large and multinational organisations. More importantly, this has led to the practice of judging SMEs, which are experiencing increasing pressure to engage in social activities, as if they are no different from their larger counterparts. This study therefore investigates CSR from the perspective of SMEs in Australia without any theoretical presumptions and then comments on the relevance and applicability of the two theories that have been commonly used to investigate business responsibility, namely, stakeholder theory (ST) and social capital theory (SCT). The research findings indicate that CSR within the SME sector is more aligned to the fundamentals of SCT, mainly owing to the unique resource and survival challenges that they face, and which are, arguably, not so pronounced in large organisations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Small and medium enterprises; Social capital theory; Stakeholder theory",,"Sen, S.; Southern Cross Business School, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, Australia; email: suman.sen@scu.edu.au",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

First of all, to show the concept of value to customers as a determiner of a company's competitive advantage. Second, to explain the changing role of marketing activities toward social responsibility. Third, to assess the influence of social marketing activities on a company's image and the resulting value to customers. Design/methodology/approach: By drawing on existing corporate social responsibility (CSR) and marketing literature, the achievements and gaps of socially responsible marketing (SRM) can be demonstrated. In addition, the literature review focuses on showing the relationship between SRM and value to a customer. In order to achieve the purposes of the chapter, an analysis of market research based on secondary data as well as qualitative interviews has been conducted. Findings: Marketing activities should accomplish both economic and social objectives as well as aim at delivering expected value to customers. Nowadays value comes not only from lower prices or a better product range. According to research, customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to evil and to social injustice, damage to the environment, as well as the increasing level of poverty. This makes companies develop new strategies for creating value for customers. These should come from socially responsible activities the company is undertaking. Thus, companies, which implement a concept of SRM, are more likely to count on increased interest and loyalty from their customers. Originality/value: This chapter offers a fresh approach to the study of the evolution of marketing toward social responsibility and the impact on the value for customers. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Company image; SRM; Value for customers",,"Rudawska, E.; Department of Marketing, Faculty of Economics and Management, University of Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland","Renko S.Knezevic B.",,1876066X,9781781908327,,,"English","Int.

We utilize social network analysis to investigate the CSR blogs of three IT firms: Google, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel.

The ideas focus on (1) clarifying the phenomenon of tenacity; (2) looking at three foundations of our tenacity; and (3) asking ""How fragile is our tenacity?"" This article also presents three foundational principles that underlie the American experience of corporate responsibility. First, the Checks & Balances Principle tells us that there are checks and balances in democratic capitalism which give us confidence that the pursuit of economic goals will be moderated for the common good. Second, the Moral Projection Principle shows that there is good reason to consider the corporation not only as a legal person under corporate law but also as a moral person. And, last, the Moral Common Ground Principle reflects that there are shared moral values ascertainable by well-developed consciences in individuals and in corporations. The article concludes with this argument: The tenacity regarding corporate responsibility that has been so characteristic of American capitalism is fragile-calling for serious vigilance if it is to endure. © 2013 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,,"Goodpaster, K.E.; Opus College of Business, University of St. Thomas, MN, United States; email: kegoodpaster@stthomas.edu",,,00453609,,,,"English","Bus.

Its mission is to accelerate progress, and its primary point of leverage is to build on the needs of food companies to demonstrate sustainable production of ingredients. To achieve this end, the Food Lab creates a pre-competitive space for member organizations to pilot innovations through business driven supply chain projects and provides opportunities for diverse stakeholders working on sustainability to meet, learn, and support each other in becoming better leaders for change in their organizations and in the larger system.

The process follows four stages: (1) adopting a strategy to cooperate in order to overcome a legitimacy crisis, (2) adopting a moderate conflict model and imposing limiting conditions into the negotiations with businesses. The limiting conditions provide a basis for a co-creation process, (3) aligning business for co-creating a new product brand, and (4) broadening the scope towards market creation for animal friendly products. The phases of the issue-life-cycle show that interventions are dependent on the nature of the interaction and the existence of a business model.

Findings show that companies issued more product-related initiatives than promotion-related ones. Among these, less than half generated a substantial number of responses from bloggers, which could not be identified as a specific group. While new product introductions led to positive buzz, modifications of current products resulted in more negative responses, even if there was a high fit with core business. While promotion-related press releases were received negatively in general, particularly periphery promotion (compared to core promotion) generated most reactions. Our exploratory study suggests that companies can increase the likelihood of a positive reaction if they carefully consider the fit between initiatives and their core business, while taking the notion of 'controversial fit', relating to the unhealthy nature of original products, into account.

It emphasizes eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), an information standard that can improve financial transparency by making reported financial activity information machine-readable and comparable. The article draws from e-government studies, collaborative public management literature, and management information systems (MIS) literature to develop a strategic model of e-government XBRL implementation. The proposed model consists of an overarching leadership and governance strategy with three interrelated areas of activity: stakeholder relationship management, phase-in implementation, and value articulation and clarification. The implementation process and success factors articulated in the model are illustrated by the SEC's effort to implement XBRL.

While social media creates an important momentum for firms to cultivate favorable awareness by establishing a powerful framework of stakeholder relationships, the opportunities are not distributed evenly for all firms. In this paper, we investigate the impact of CSR credentials on the effectiveness of social media as a stakeholder-relationship management platform. The analysis of Fortune 500 companies in the Twitter sphere reveals that a higher CSR rating is a strong indicator of an earlier adoption, a faster establishment of online presence (followers), a higher responsiveness to the firm's identity (replies and mentions), and a stronger virality of the messages (retweets). Incidentally, the higher CSIR rating is also found to be associated with the stronger virality. Our findings also suggest that socially responsible firms can harvest proactive stakeholders' participation (user-driven communication) without investing more resources (firm-driven communication). As the first study that conceptualizes the social media as a proponent of CSR, this paper contends that ""being socially responsible"" makes more practical sense for firms with the rise of social media. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CSIR; CSR; Social media; Twitter",,"Oh, W.-Y.; University of Calgary, Haskayne School of Business, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4, Canada; email: won.oh@haskayne.ucalgary.ca",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Enterprise strategy articulates how the firm engages with actors in its economic, social, and political environment to ensure long-term corporate performance. As a growing body of evidence shows, heterogeneity in how firms identify, and engage with, their stakeholders can explain why some firms outperform their peers. However, my literature survey of more than three decades of published research reveals that enterprise strategy has stayed firmly in the shadows behind business and corporate strategy. Furthermore, many theories of firm-stakeholder relationships are normative (i.e. explain how firms should act) and do not inform strategy effectively. In this paper, I argue why enterprise strategy research is required as a cohesive body of work that connects with research in business and corporate strategy. I finish by proposing three research domains - strategic goals, organization design, and organization boundaries - that hold the potential to link stakeholder issues with mainstream concerns in strategy research and, thus, to revive a coherent research programme in enterprise level strategy. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.","Enterprise strategy; General management; Stakeholders; Sustainability",,"Crilly, D.; London Business School, Regent's Park, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom; email: dcrilly@london.edu",,,00222380,,,,"English","J.

In the meantime, scholars from other social sciences, such as economics, political science or sociology, did not hesitate as much to analyse the emergence of new forms of private and hybrid ""governance without government"" from a functional perspective. Even though legal theory has much to learn from such functional approaches, they fail under one crucial aspect: They cannot uphold the analytical distinction between law and non-law, as they only focus on governance efficiency from an actor-based perspective that is blind to ""law's own rationality"", which focus on the stabilisation of normative expectations in the society as a whole. Therefore, such functional approaches to the study of global governance need to be enhanced by elements borrowed from the systems theory of law by Niklas Luhmann. This will provide us with a conceptual framework to analyse the mechanisms of global governance regimes without ignoring their potential for ""legalisation"".

The fact that Malaysia has diverging ethnic groups and cultural system, this study addresses an insight analysis of CSR from a different perspective. The study seeks to find out the level of CSR understanding of the Malaysian executives in the financial services sector across different ethnic groups. A total of 376 responses were collected and analysed in this study. The questionnaire was used to measure the perceptions of the respondents towards several CSR issues. The findings across ethnicity of the respondents revealed that in general, there is no homogenous consensus.

Corporations in China are increasingly expected by the public and government to be more socially responsible. As such, it will be intriguing to ask, what are the characteristics associated with higher quality CSR reporting? Design/methodology/approach: CSR report quality scores are hand-gathered from HEXUN (web site) whilst financial and stock market information from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. A total of 613 CSR reports' quality scores were utilized (Rankins CSR ratings) in the process of developing the model. Reports are hand-gathered from corporations listed on both the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges (SSE). Findings: The results suggest most interestingly, the quality of CSR report (mandatory) to be strongly, positively related with corporate financial characteristics: market capitalization (corporate size), shareholders' concentration of powers, corporate financial leverage (implying bondholders/debtors' influence). Surprisingly, CSR reporting is associated neither with corporate profitability nor by state-ownership. The presence of independent directors (at least in China) seems to have negative influences. Practical implications: CSR reporting may easily be mandated by government through a regulatory process. However, this does not necessarily lead to reports of a high quality. Instead, orientation towards higher visibility in social responsibility for listed corporations is better explained by financial characteristics: market valuation, ownership and leverage. Originality/value: This paper utilizes for the first time, in-depth and multi-faceted quality CSR scores (overall, segregated into macro-social, content and technology) for investigating CSR behavior of listed corporations in China. The findings suggest financial characteristics size (market valuation), ownership (shareholders' concentration of powers) and corporate leverage are better predictors of CSR behavior among listed corporations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate characteristics; Corporate social responsibility report; Mandatory disclosure",,"Li, Y.; Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; email: yhli@bjtu.edu.cn",,,1750614X,,,,"English","Chin.

The current ominous state of poverty in South Africa together with South Africa's commitment to the United Nations Millennium Declaration to halve poverty by 2015 has motivated the researchers to consider Prahalad's proposition of collaborating with the various constituencies including the multinational corporations (MNCs) to address the needs of the BOP market. This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility of implementing Prahalad's Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) proposition in the South African market and to conceptualize alternative approaches to developing marketing strategies for the South African BOP consumers. The study adopts a theoretical research study. It reviews statistics on the extent of poverty in South Africa. Arguments for and against the BOP proposition are examined and the researchers assess how the BOP proposition may work in the South African context. The secondary data indicates that the BOP is a lucrative market in the South African context. The authors conclude that the BOP proposition, if effectively implemented, has the potential to reduce poverty in South Africa and increase the profits of multinational corporations (MNCs). The researchers recognize the importance of MNC's buying into the BOP proposition from the standpoint of corporate social responsibility (CSR).

We have found evidence on the determinants for CSR reporting posited by existing literature that have an impact on (a) the decision of companies to publish their CSR reports, (b) the decision to assure the CSR report or not and (c) the decision to hire the assurance services from an auditor or a consultant and the subsequent quality of the assurance report. Last but not least, our results from a sample of 161 CSR assurance reports evidence that assurance reports are of fairly acceptable quality, according to the index proposed. Furthermore, the value of the quality index is significantly higher if the assurance services are provided by an auditor (as opposed to a consultant) and if the CSR reporting company is larger. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Assurance; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental policy; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable development","corporate strategy; environmental economics; environmental policy; stakeholder; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; Spain","Zorio, A.; Universitat de ValenciaSpain",,,09644733,,,,"English","Bus.

Corporate public communications at the same time promote community engagement as a core aspect of corporate social responsibility. This article examines the possibilities for and conditions underpinning corporate dialogue with marginalized stakeholders as occurred around the unexpected and sudden closure in January 2009 of the AU$2.2 billion BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel mine in rural Western Australia. In doing so we draw on John Roberts' notion of dialogue with vulnerable others, and apply a discourse analysis approach to data spanning corporate public communications and interviews with residents affected by the decision to close the mine. In presenting this case study we contribute to the as yet limited organizational research concerned directly with marginalized stakeholders and argue that corporate social responsibility discourse and vulnerable other dialogue not only affirms the primacy of business interests but also co-opts vulnerable others in the pursuit of these interests.

Two main themes in this literature are the exploration of management incentives to engage in and disclose this information, and of the use and value of this information to market participants. We extend the second theme by examining the interest that specific investor classes have in the use of CSR information. We rely on feminist intersectionality, which suggests that gender intersects with other identities to yield different values, experiences, and opportunities that can lead to gender-based preferences for CSR information. Based upon a survey of 750 US-based retail investors, we find that female retail investors have a greater interest in the use of CSR information, relative to male retail investors. Women express greater anticipated future demand for this information than do men. Further, the magnitude of the increase from current use to anticipated future demand is greater for women than men. Age is a significant modifying factor in that the discrepancy between women of any age and older men is greater than that between women and younger men. Finally, women also exhibit greater demand for streamlining of the information flow, consistent with pressures induced by time poverty. It appears that current disclosure practices provide a less than optimal match with the needs of the information consumers that are primarily interested in using this information. This mismatch may result in a systematic disenfranchisement of female investing classes which suggests an ethical need to level the playing field. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethics; Feminist intersectionality; Gender; Investment behavior",,"Cohen, J.; Department of Accounting, Carroll School of Management, Boston College, 544 Fulton Hall, Chestnut Hill, MA, 02147, United States; email: cohen@bc.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Using an action research approach, I explore the possibilities and challenges of using hybrid problem-based learning to help business students engage in critically reflexive processes and, thus, the social construction of corporate social responsibility meanings.

Elite, in-depth conversations with 19 senior executives at 16 companies in India well known for their CSR initiatives revealed that practitioners appeared to be both organizational activists and agents. As organizational activists, they acknowledged the existence of diverse voices in local communities, interjected these voices into management discourse, situated decision-making in local contexts, identified tensors in the relationship between the corporation and its publics, and negotiated new meanings through dissensus. Paradoxically, as organizational agents, they used these participatory, open processes of dialogic communication to shape public opinion in favour of the organization, feeding modern organizations' proclivity for consensus. While the findings of the study support the postmodern conceptualization of the public relations practitioner as an organizational activist in the context of CSR and community relations, the agent aspect of the activist-agent dialectic problematizes and complicates this conceptualization thus enhancing understandings of the postmodern practitioner who enacts CSR within a modernist framework and navigates the intricacies of the activist-agent dialectic in their daily performance of building community relations and enabling democratic processes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Community relations; Corporate social responsibility; CSR in India; Dialectics; Organizational activist; Postmodern public relations",,"Dhanesh, G.S.; Department of Communications and New Media, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, National University of Singapore, Blk AS6, #03-41, 11 Computing Drive, Singapore; email: ganga@nus.edu.sg",,,03638111,,PRERE,,"English","Public Relat.

Study 1 investigates perceived sponsor-club fit, confirming attitude and corporate positioning similarity as relevant predictors. Importantly, CSR image similarity does not impact fit, suggesting sponsorship opportunities for organizations independent of their initial CSR image. Study 2 shows perceived sponsor CSR image to mediate the relationship between the perceptions of a community-based property's CSR image and consumers' self-congruity with the sponsor.

Proposing a social movement perspective on MNCs' responsiveness to social issues in emerging markets, we identify the mechanisms by which online activists grab firms' attention and force them to become more socially responsive. A perception of organizational vulnerability and a home-country institutional logic that is consistent with the demands of the online campaign provide political opportunity structures that hasten the corporate response but affect the magnitude of firm response differently. We test our framework in the empirical context of corporate philanthropic action following the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province in China, which triggered an online campaign that questioned MNCs' donations to the disaster relief effort.

The aim of the research question is to map out the consequences upon CSR derived from the crisis and to derive new principles of future CSR models to come consistent with the consequences of the financial crisis, and to suggest new research as well as policy-making possibilities to highlight the importance and necessary survival of CSR as an instrument for sustainable and financial progress. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a literature review of CSR prior to and after the financial crisis 2008, with an emphasis on academic papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Findings - The findings of the paper reveal that post-crisis CSR-models do not articulate anything that has not been mentioned before; however , they do strengthen former values of CSR, but still lack an overall formula of how the financial sector can adopt CSR in the core of their businesses, and transparently display their products, and the risk adhering to them. The paper proposes a new Four-""E""-Principle that may guide new CSR-models to accomplish this deficit. See under "" Originality"". Practical implications - The paper calls for a discussion on ways in which governments and businesses can enhance social responsibility, though balancing the requirements of more engagement from businesses, as well as public sector companies in CSR. This paper suggests some instrumental mechanisms of how governments can engage, not only multinational companies, but also smaller companies, and other kinds of organizations acting on the market, to make them engage more in CSR. Originality/value - The paper proposes a new Four-""E""-Principle to guide the development of new CSR-models based upon the core of Schwartz and Carroll's ""Three-domain CSR-model"", which the Principle extends and revises to: Economy, L/Egal, Environment, and Ethics. This Principle disentangles the dialectic relationship between economic and social responsibility; takes financial products into consideration; refines the definitions of good stakeholder engagement without the illusions of corporate ""Potemkinity"" and considers the benefit of replacing the semiotic meaning of the ""C"" in CSR from ""corporate"" to ""capitalism's social responsibility"" in order to extend the concept towards a broader range of market agents. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR-concepts; Financial crisis; Financial sector; Government role",,"Lauesen, L.M.; Copenhagen Business School, Department of Intercultural Communication and Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark; email: linne.lauesen@gmail.com",,,17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Design/methodology/approach - Out of 275 food companies in Japan, three leading companies were selected as cases. Their corporate websites were examined to identify the participating public schools and the teachers who had been recruited to evaluate their experiences with corporate programs. Findings - Teachers learned about corporate programs through governmental sources and direct mailings from the companies. They were motivated to use corporate lessons because of food education, creative experience-based activity, and a newly created school subject termed ""integrated study"", which became a great receptor for corporate programs. This study suggested that corporate lessons positively changed the perceptions of teachers toward the business community. Research limitations/implications - Because this is a case study, the findings may not be generalized to other situations or other countries.

In the investment industry, these wider sets of value drivers are known as environment-socialgovernance (ESG) factors. A small number of specialized ESG rating agencies provide information to investors about the extent to which firms' behaviors are socially responsible. However, a major criticism of these rating agencies is the lack of transparency in their methods. This paper aims to examine the issues of subjectivity, transparency and uniformity of ESG ratings by exploring the methods used to assess ethics performance by an Australian rating agency. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was conducted on an Australian ESG rating provider, Regnan. The data for the analysis were sourced from internal Regnan documents. Findings - The paper found that a level of subjectivity is inevitable in ESG ratings and the call for uniformity may inhibit innovation, but these issues can be addressed by increased transparency of the rating methods. Research limitations/implications - Further research is required to understand what level and, combination of, uniformity and transparency is sufficient to satisfy stakeholder requirements for ESG information. Practical implications - The discussion of the factors underlying the ethics performance rating may prompt more open and transparent debate on how to assess ethical performance of companies, and increase investor confidence in ESG ratings. It may also provide more direction to companies on how to strengthen their ethical performance. Originality/value - There is growing recognition that numerous business drivers contribute to financial performance and investment returns but they are not included in a company's profit and loss statements. These ""ESG"" factors can account for up to 66 percent of the market value of globally listed companies. In response to calls for more transparency on how ESG factors are assessed, and how ethical performance is appraised, this paper attempts to lift the veil on ESG rating methods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Corporate social performance; Environment-social-governance; ESG performance; ESG rating agencies; Ethics performance",,"Stubbs, W.; School of Geography and Environmental Science, Monash University, Clayton, Australia; email: stubbs@monash.edu",,,17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

The role of supply chain management is fundamental to CSR implementation as it has become a key customer requirement and business driver. This research seeks to investigate how the luxury sector is addressing these demands through a single in-depth exploratory study of a Scottish based luxury own-brand and branded cashmere garment manufacturer. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an exploratory approach through a single qualitative case study. Findings: Corporate social responsibility has become an increasingly important part of the luxury garment producer's operation. The luxury brands are now placing additional demands on the cashmere producer to demonstrate compliance with CSR standards which in turn requires the company to adjust its operating procedure and management processes. The current levels of transparency and auditability of the CSR management process throughout the layers of the business were less sophisticated than currently found in many mid-market garment manufacturers and retailers. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the paper are based on a single qualitative exploratory study and therefore analytic generalisations are possible from interpreting the results. Practical implications: The contribution of the paper is a greater understanding of CSR management in the work and information flows for a specialised international luxury manufacturing business throughout its geographically extended supply chain.

Given this reality, this study aims to contribute to the analysis, discussion and modeling of epistemic and practical CSR in tourism and more specifically in the hospitality industry. There was an extensive review of the literature related to theories and models of CSR management and then it was applied the case method for the empirical research in a hosting company in Santa Marta, Colombia. The results of the study show an analysis for the hotel in CRS. The conclusion is that the company is more near the proactivity than legal reactivity, since it begins to carry out practices of social responsibility that it is not forced to realize by law. In the same way, it applies a tactical social responsibility and has an average level of responsibility social with their stakeholder according to qualitative and quantitative assessments of the study.

Design/methodology/approach: A case-study research strategy was used to address the lack of existing research on enterprise training for postgraduate researchers (PGRs). The initial task was to identify those UK universities which provide enterprise and entrepreneurship training for their PGRs. Based on this desk exercise, five universities were selected according to the nature and structure of their training programmes and geographical spread such that one university was included from Wales, Scotland, South of England, Midlands and North of England. The next stage of the research focused on gaining in-depth understanding of the enterprise training available to PRGs at selected universities through face-to-face semi-structured interviews with key personnel responsible for the design and management of PGR enterprise education programmes. The data collected were analysed using the Rugby Team Impact Framework to explore the training and development provision and structure, internal and external profile raising and awareness, staff and skills required, research-based practices, the reaction of participants, behaviour and outcomes, stakeholder engagement and on-going strategy. Findings: The paper highlights the current best practices in enterprise education for PGRs. It identified key factors contributing to the success of selected programmes including the development of objectives, the modes and pedagogy of delivery and the involvement of stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The results of the research enable universities across the UK to drive the development of a suite of learning opportunities tailored to the needs of the PGR population in order to overcome barriers to engagement and best promote entrepreneurial activity - both within employment and as new venture creation - as appropriate career options.

The authors investigate the co-evolution between pioneers introducing radically more sustainable offerings and (mostly large) market leaders with their responses. While sustainability pioneers introduce new products in niche markets, incumbents advance them into the mass market, together leading to the transformation of industries, markets and consumer habits. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply the sustainable entrepreneurship perspective to a case study of the German clothing retail industry with a focus on organic cotton. The analysis covers four of the ten largest German textile retailers. Data collection is based on public available sources. Findings: The late 1970s saw the foundation of Hess Natur, which pioneered organic cotton practices and supported the development of sustainability standards in the clothing industry. In the beginning this was largely a phenomenon in niche markets, but to date some organic practices have diffused amongst mainstream retailers. This is counter-intuitive, as theory suggests that incumbents only adopt practices with significantly lower sustainability standards than companies in the niche. Research limitations/implication: The study suggests that more research should focus on the co-evolutionary dynamics between pioneering companies and incumbents and examine whether and how sustainability practices diffuse into the mass market. Practical implications: The findings can help managers to better understand their organisation's role in the transformation of industries towards sustainability and, vice versa, how the transformation may affect them. Leading the transformation challenge by adopting organic and other sustainable supply chain practices can be an important measure for market success. Originality/value: This study is one of the few pieces of research investigating sustainability-oriented industry transformation from a market-based perspective. Actual data on organic cotton diffusion in German retail are presented. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability; Germany; Integrated production; Organic cotton; Supply chain management; Sustainability-oriented innovation; Sustainable entrepreneurship; Textile industry; Transformation",,"Hansen, E.

It has two main aims: to discuss the theoretical approach to CSR governance, proposing a matrix to classify international CSR accountability standards; and to study the CSR multi-industry standardization cycle (setting and design, diffusion and implementation), creating an analytical framework to understand the innovative dynamics adopted through CSR standard-setting. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on empirical research on global CSR multi-industry standards and the emergence of a regulatory dynamic based on competition-collaboration. The paper's arguments stem from a case study of the Global Reporting Initiative and its inter-linkage and convergence with the UN Global Compact and ISO 26000. The author analyzes this case based on the global governance and institutional dynamics of regulation research. Findings: Based on the study of CSR standards, the paper presents an analytical framework with various elements to analyze CSR accountability standards: scope, type of actors, performance type and mechanisms and type of legitimacy and monitoring strategies. Second, the paper advances the study of emerging inter-linkages between GRI, UNGC and ISO 26000 and analyzes the emergence of a meta-standardization process generated by the competition-collaboration dynamic. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed to focus on the role of agency and different stakeholders on the meta-standardization process. Other research has to focus on the institutional logic and the multi-level analysis of the convergence between CSR standards and the self-regulation advanced process. In this respect, this research serves to demonstrate the leading innovative role adopted by private actors (mostly companies) in developing private standard setting for global governance. Originality/value: The value of this paper is its analysis of the main convergence dynamic adopted by the most popular, global-scope CSR multi-industry standards, GRI, UNGC and ISO 26000. The findings show how this standardization cycle helps a new collaborative governance dynamic to emerge based on the adoption of private standard-setting. The paper is also useful for practitioners, helping them understand the growing convergence among CSR multi-industry standards, and how the convergence of sustainability reporting processes is advancing towards the integration and drafting of homogeneous guidelines with the prevalence of the GRI model. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","corporate social responsibility; Governance; Institutional dynamics; Standard-setting; Standardization cycle; Sustainability",,"Albareda, L.; Department of Strategy, Deusto Business School, Bilbao, Spain; email: laura.albareda@deusto.es",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

Design/methodology/approach: Using contingency theory, factors are identified that influence corporate decisions to introduce an IETS. To examine the effects of IETSs, emissions data for a sample of large German companies is used for linear regression modelling. Findings: The paper finds that today, IETSs are mainly applied by companies with high levels of emissions that are subject to external trading schemes. The current use of IETSs seems to be primarily driven by the interest to reduce emissions cost-efficiently. Testing the effects of IETSs reveals that they are able to reduce corporate GHG emissions significantly. Research limitations/implications: The effects of IETSs are only tested for companies subject to an external emission trading scheme. Furthermore, the analysis does not distinguish between different types of IETSs. Future research should address the issue of whether the reductions observed also hold true for companies not subject to external trading schemes and should formulate recommendations on how IETSs should be designed. Practical implications: The paper informs practitioners about the potential benefits of IETSs. Originality/value: For the first time, the effects of IETSs are tested for companies subject to an external emission trading scheme. The analysis suggests that a new academic debate on IETSs is needed as the introduction of external emission trading schemes has not rendered IETSs redundant. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Contingency theory; Corporate social responsibility; EU Emission Trading Scheme; Global warming; Internal emission trading schemes; Organizational innovation",,"Hörisch, J.; Centre for Sustainability Management, Leuphana University Lüneburg, Lüneburg, Germany",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents the essentials of a public goods cost perspective in order to agitate discussion between statisticians, standard-setters for business reporting and practitioners who wish to explore new approaches in the topic of building performance indicators. Findings: The paper illustrates what has been achieved in measuring the outcomes of sustainable development efforts and what still needs to be done in order to arrive at aggregate values for national and global commons. Research limitations/implications: The viability of the concept will depend on the co-operation of businesses and national statistics which test the feasibility of the proposed micro-macro-link through numerical studies.

Practical implications: For practitioners in both the statistics profession and management accounting who are concerned with measurement of socioeconomic and environmental phenomena, this attempt at integrating sustainable development indicators to the managerial control system of companies might provide a valuable proposition. It also is a helpful contribution to the ongoing debate about the value and credibility of sustainability reporting. Social implications: If businesses make no attempts to exhibit numerically how they contribute to preserve and expand the societal commons, they will be confronted with ever-growing agitation from pressure groups and they might be bypassed in the discussion on the issue of sustainability parameters that those groups are advocating.

Internationally, we look at the CSR orientations of students in the United States and China. Within the United States, we focus on the states of Utah and Oregon. Our findings suggest that dominant existing frameworks could be improved through greater specification of substantive issues areas and stakeholder interests. Findings also suggest single level analyses may ignore important variation in CSR perceptions across geographical/cultural boundaries. In particular, significant subnational (within country) variation in attitudes and perspectives exist.

In addition, across two studies, we found that disclaimer speed and brand familiarity interact to predict brand trust and purchase intention, and that brand trust mediated the interactive effect of brand familiarity and disclaimer speed on purchase intention. Our results indicate that fast disclaimers actually reduce brand trust and purchase intention for unfamiliar brands, suggesting that there are both economic and social responsibility reasons to use less rapid disclaimers for unfamiliar brands. Conversely, disclaimer speed had no negative effects on brand trust and purchase intention for highly familiar brands, presenting ethical tensions between economic interests (e.g., an efficient use of advertisement time) and social responsibility.

Universal conceptions can incorporate multiple options and permit variation and evolution. The ""essentially contested"" character of a ""cluster concept"" is partly about influencing legal and ethical standards, public policies, and specific business practices.

Thus, in a large empirical study across several industries and countries, we examined CSR as moderator of the relationship between marketing capabilities and firm performance. Our study also follows prior research that calls for an inclusion of competitive intensity as a boundary condition to this moderation effect. As hypothesized, three-way interactions among competitive intensity, CSR, and marketing capabilities had significant relationships with firm performance. For firms in industries with high competitive intensity, marketing capabilities have a stronger positive impact on performance when CSR is high versus low.

However, gaps remain on how CSR can be effectively integrated with existing business processes. One key question remaining is how to design business processes so that they accommodate stakeholder requirements in an integrated manner. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework that can be used to integrate CSR into business processes. The framework highlights the concept of simultaneous 'top-down integration' and 'bottom-up community-related indicators development' approaches to CSR. These two approaches are elaborated with the help of two cases. The top-down approach focuses on building CSR into existing business initiatives through an integrated management systems (IMS) approach. This paper concludes that an IMS approach provides the infrastructure for the integration of CSR. The bottom-up approach focuses on the development of indicators linked to community initiatives. Examples of best practice for both the top-down and bottom-up approaches are provided in two case studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using stakeholder theory, we specifically propose that several factors increase the salience and impact of stakeholders' demands on the firm and that, in response to these factors, a firm's CSP will have greater breadth. A firm's CSP breadth is operationalized as the number of different sub-domains of CSR for which a firm has taken positive actions and is captured using a unique dataset from Kinder, Lydenburg, and Domini (KLD). This data set includes positive and negative firm actions across more than 35 different dimensions of socially responsible behavior. Findings based on a longitudinal, multi-industry sample of 447 US firms during the period from 2000 to 2007 demonstrate that firms which: (1) have greater sensitivity to stakeholder needs as a result of the firm's strategic emphasis on marketing and/or value creation, (2) face greater diversity of stakeholder demands, and (3) encounter a greater degree of scrutiny or risk from stakeholder action have a greater breadth of CSP in response to the stakeholder landscape that they face. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social performance (CSP); KLD database; Stakeholder theory",,"Brower, J.; School of Business, Queen's University, Goodes Hall, 143 Union St., Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada; email: jbrower@business.queensu.ca",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) can provide firms with opportunities for profit, but changes are likely to increase total welfare only if firms adopt them freely and without taxpayer subsidies. Mandated CSR circumvents people's own plans and preferences, distorts the allocation of resources, and increases the likelihood of irresponsible decisions. Evidence that government policies will increase welfare and a compelling argument that proven benefits outweigh reductions in freedom are necessary in order to justify CSR mandates. To date, this has apparently not been achieved. Corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) is concerned with whether firms undertake harmful actions that managers would be unwilling to undertake acting for themselves, or that a reasonable person would expect to cause substantive net harm when all parties are considered. Markets in which stakeholders are free to make decisions in their own interests provide some protection against CSI. Tort and contract law provide additional protection. Nevertheless, managers sometimes act irresponsibly. Codes of ethics that require fair treatment of stakeholders while pursuing long-term profit can reduce the risk of irresponsible decisions. Management support and stakeholder accounting are important for successful implementation. Firms may wish to consider these measures; many already have. © 2013.","Accountability; Affirmative action; Decision making; Ethics; Externalities; Free markets; Minimum wage; Paternalism; Principal-agent problem; Regulation; Seer-sucker theory; Stakeholder accounting; Stakeholder theory; Sustainability",,"Armstrong, J.S.; The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; email: Armstrong@wharton.upenn.edu",,,01482963,,JBRED,,"English","J.

More than ever before, companies engage in CSR initiatives to make a positive contribution to society or support their strategic goals. Yet, in the face of a plethora of CSR claims and numerous reported incidents of corporate misconduct, many people doubt the extent to which companies live up to their professed standards, and consumer skepticism toward corporate social involvement is on the rise. Drawing on attribution theory, this study proposes and tests a model that explains both how consumer skepticism toward the CSR of grocery retailers develops and its influence on important consumer-related outcomes. The findings reveal that attributions of egoistic- and stakeholder-driven motives elicit consumer skepticism toward CSR, while values-driven attributions inhibit skepticism. The results also indicate that CSR skepticism hurts retailer equity, decreases resistance to negative information about the retailer, and stimulates unfavorable word of mouth. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Attributions; Corporate social responsibility; Equity; Resilience to negative information; Retailing; Skepticism; Word of mouth",,"Skarmeas, D.; Athens University of Economics and Business, Department of Marketing and Communication, 12 Derigny Str., Athens 10434, Greece; email: dskarmeas@aueb.gr",,,01482963,,JBRED,,"English","J.

Using an experimental design with a control group, this research examines consumers' willingness-to-reward and its converse willingness-to-punish a corporate brand under three treatment conditions of socially responsible, socially irresponsible, and environmentally friendly. Data were collected on four outcome variables of willingness-to-punish, willingness-to-reward, brand attitude, and purchase intention for each treatment group. MANOVA results indicated that there were systematic differences in the levels of outcomes among the four groups. Discriminant function analysis found the socially irresponsible group was statistically significantly different from the other three experimental groups for all four outcome variables. Consumers dealing with socially irresponsible corporate brands were more likely to punish and less likely to reward than consumers in the other three treatment conditions. This study illustrates the latent negative impact from CSI activities on four important dimensions of consumer response. The findings indicate there is a pragmatic need for corporate brand strategists to recognize consumers' willingness-to-punish the corporate brand and the subsequent necessity to avoid activities that consumers may perceive to be socially irresponsible. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Brand personality dimension; Consumer stakeholder group; Consumer's CSR association; Consumer's willingness-to-punish; Corporate social irresponsibility; Corporate social responsibility",,"Sweetin, V.H.; Department of Marketing, Donald W.

This quasi-experimental study examines the relationship between the perceived environmental performance of a company (PEP) and consumers' purchase intentions, and then determines whether this relationship is moderated by the degree of consumers' environmental involvement (EI) and by the relative price of company products. Surveys were posted to a random sample of residents in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, Australia. Responses (n. =. 698) show that participants report higher purchase intention for products from high versus low PEP companies, and that participants' EI and product price moderate this relationship. Those with high EI report greater purchase intention for high PEP companies and the reverse for low PEP companies, indicating that participants with high EI are more positively influenced by their perceptions of a company's environmental performance. However, participants are more likely to favor a high PEP company when the relative price of a product is low versus high, irrespective of their level of EI. The strong relationship between companies' PEP and consumers' purchase intentions affirms that developing and managing an environmental brand image may deliver significant benefits, as long as it is appropriately communicated to consumers, and as long as consumers see the added value of making such purchases. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Consumer attitudes; Consumer behavior; Corporate social responsibility; Green marketing; Pricing",,"Grimmer, M.; School of Management, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 16, Hobart, TAS 7001, Australia; email: Martin.Grimmer@utas.edu.au",,,01482963,,JBRED,,"English","J.

Among the many challenges to effective private sector engagement, understanding how to increase organizational motivation in this direction is essential. A model is developed to explain how four characteristics of the national context (issue salience of poverty, field cohesion of powerful stakeholders, field distance between rich and poor, and national concern with poverty alleviation) shape the competitive, legitimation, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) motives to alleviate poverty. In-group CSR and Universalist CSR are distinguished to reflect self-interested concern for employees and local communities on the one hand and a less utilitarian desire to alleviate poverty of marginalized, destitute individuals on the other. Together, these four characteristics of the national context and four organizational motivations may help explain cross-national variations in private sector poverty alleviation practices. Greater issue salience of poverty, less field distance between rich and poor, and a higher level of national concern about poverty alleviation in Brazil, relative to the United States, are predicted to explain why there are more private sector poverty alleviation efforts in Brazil. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Brazil; Corporate social responsibility; Field cohesion; International management; Issue salience; Poverty alleviation; United States; Work-family",,"Lobel, S.; Seattle University, Albers School of Business and Economics, 901 12th Avenue, P.O.

However, how legitimate are standards and certification schemes developed by collaborating non-state actors for sustainability in global value chains? What are conditions for the success of those market-based governance mechanisms?

The authors contrast whether there is a trend as regards CSR reporting and CSR assurance, depending on whether the crisis has already begun or not. Next the authors focus on companies that change their CSR reporting strategy or change their CSR assurance strategy and see if there is an impact on performance (both from an accounting and from a market perspective). Findings: Even though the financial crisis has raised the question whether assurance of CSR reports could be a threat for business, bearing in mind the generalized initiatives to cut costs, the results show that the number of CSR reports increased significantly with the crisis (indeed, significant differences were found in ROE from CSR adopters to CSR discontinuing companies). Nonetheless, no significant impact was found regarding the changes in assurance strategy, even though there are no grounds to expect cuts in this area because the absolute number of assured reports is increasing, yet not significantly. Practical implications: In spite of the current financial crisis, this study identifies a business in a stage of expansion, not only CSR reporting but also assurance of CSR reports, and confirms the stability in time of the CSR assurance decision by companies as an added-value strategy to CSR reporting. There seems to be an investment view of CSR reporting and CSR assurance, which can help companies differentiate their products or services from the competition and reinforce stakeholders' trust. Originality/value: This is a pioneering study on the actual effects that the financial crisis has had on CSR reporting and assurance strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Assurance; Business strategy; Corporate governance; Financial crisis; Financial reporting; Social responsibility; Spain; Sustainability",,"Sierra-Garcia, L.; Departamento de Economía, Financiera y Contabilidad, Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Sevilla, Spain; email: lnsiegar@upo.es",,,00251747,,,,"English","Manage.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample consisting of 208 firms listed in the Japan Nikkei Stock Index 500 and adopts three-stage least-squares (3SLS) to explore the relationship between environmental news exposure, environmental disclosure in corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, and environmental legitimacy. Findings: Results indicate that firms from environmentally-sensitive industries can significantly improve their perceived legitimacy by releasing CSR reports; firms with better prior environmental legitimacy will be more active in environmental disclosure and establish better environmental legitimacy in the next period; firms with better carbon reduction performance tend to have higher levels of environmental disclosure. In terms of carbon reduction performance, Japanese firms in the sample may reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 49.636 tons by allocating one million yens (approximately 9,670.3 euros or 12,328 US dollars) to environmental expenditure. Practical implications: The top three items of environmental disclosure in most Japanese firms' CSR reports are environmental management, development of alternative energies, and ecological information. These results reveal environmental behavior of sample firms in Japan to mitigate global warming. The managers should understand that the impact of substantive actions for environmental management on legitimacy is greater. Originality/value: Environmental management has become an important component of business management beliefs for most firms, and Japanese firms that belong to environmentally-sensitive industries are even more active in using CSR reports as an effective tool to establish their legitimacy image. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Corporate strategy; Disclosure; Environmental disclosure; Environmental legitimacy; Environmental management; Japan; Social responsibility; Three-stage least-squares",,"Kuo, L.; Department of Accounting, Tamkang University, New Taipei City, Taiwan; email: lopinkuo@mail.tku.edu.tw",,,00251747,,,,"English","Manage.

Since the 1980s, Patagonia has become well known for its progressive environmental and social initiatives. Indeed, the Patagonia brand has become synonymous with conservation.

The company has a unique corporate culture, and an unconventional business model-in which more emphasis is put on environmentally sustainable practices than on generating profits. However, neither of these has been an impediment to growth. On the contrary, sales and profits have increased at impressive annual rates since the global economic recession in 2009. The increase is no doubt linked to a growing awareness among consumers of the ethical credentials of businesses.

While numerous business management, leadership, and human resource management texts have for years emphasized the relevance of ethical values for moral leadership, only in the last few years has research into the nature and applicability of business ethics multiplied. But, notwithstanding, the sphere of business and leadership ethics still appears indefinite. While some locate business ethics more upon a corporate, system level within concepts such as corporate social responsibility and sustainability, others position ethical values at the level of some kind of leader-follower relationship. From a somewhat normative perspective, individual leadership is being examined using ethical dimensions such as 'good' or 'bad' leadership skills. In particular, in the business literature, exploratory research into the fundamental moral dimension of leadership is limited. This paper will investigate the dichotomy of ethics in practice and theory in an attempt to identify a new framework for applied ethics in leadership. To this end, the absolute essence of ethical and moral behavior needs to be revisited. By examining several international business programs' ethics and leadership education, this research will highlight the imperative to differentiate between ethics and morals, both in theory and practice. © Common Ground, Sabine H.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses examples obtained from a critical incidents approach to interviews with a small sample of German and British luxury consumers. Informants were asked to identify extremely positive and then extremely negative incidents which affected their perceptions of luxury brands. This critical incidents approach allowed for a clearer focus on the negative incidents and allowed identification of common themes that may be related to extreme negative affect. Findings: The evaluation of negative incidents which the informants named suggest that country of origin, consumer dissatisfaction with service, and negative stereotypes of luxury brand users are potential antecedents of brand hate within the luxury sector. Some types of advertising might heighten the latter effect. Consumers' perceptions of corporate social performance did not seem to be a strong source of brand hate, yet the respondents stressed the significance of luxury brands to act responsibly. Thus, it is important for luxury brands to avoid potential dissonance in the way consumers perceive them. Research limitations/implications: This primarily conceptual paper uses examples from Germany and the UK. Therefore, it is recommended to continue with studies in other countries, including emerging economies, to identify potential cross-cultural differences. Furthermore, it would be interesting to ascertain which factors are the most significant in evoking extreme negative brand affect. Practical implications: The core reputation of the luxury brand is a common theme which is identified as a driving force of brand hate. Brand practitioners therefore need to consider how to build a strong positive reputation in order to withstand the immediate and long-term consequences of brand hate. Originality/value: The need to investigate antecedents of extreme negative affect as manifested in brand hate reflects a gap in extant literature on luxury brand management.

The paper presents the notion and the basics of corporate volunteering (CV), with emphasis on its capacity to strengthen the bonds between the company and its employees. Design/methodology/approach: With the intention of approaching the actual state of corporate volunteering, a survey was conducted of Spanish firms regarding their managers' perceptions of the main success factors and the potential benefits and costs of CV programs. Findings: In the contemporary Spanish business environment, companies have incorporated volunteer initiatives as a key element of their corporate responsibility strategy. The importance of the practice of CV is interpreted as a symptom of commitment to a stronger socially responsible behavior in Spanish companies. Practical implications: To stay well informed of employees' needs, to evaluate which NGOs to work with or human resource management responsiveness, the authors put forward recommendations for CV programs designed to increase both competitive sustainability and employee satisfaction and retention. Originality/value: Reflecting the literature which highlights the importance of CV in Spain, the results indicate that while organizations strive to achieve corporate responsibility goals, it is expected that effectiveness will be greater among organizations using CV for this purpose.

Design/methodology/approach: Desk-based research was carried out. Findings: The scope of the paper is confined to two major aspects of the criminal law - that of manslaughter, both statutory and at common law and also touches on the range of health and safety offences available to the courts. In terms of manslaughter, under the common law, it is gross negligence that is considered. Research limitations/implications: The paper does not attempt an analysis of forms of civil liability but does reflect on the broader relationship between responsibility of directors and company law. The debate over the responsibility of those in leading positions following death or injury to members of the workforce remains a live and problematic one. It is clearly linked to wider considerations of corporate responsibility. Originality/value: On the one hand, those advocates of a system targeting erring directors in a direct fashion see utilisation of the criminal law (apportioning the full weight of public opprobrium), as the most effective way of improving safety for the workforce. By contrast the opposing view is that senior personnel rarely set out to kill or injure those who work for them and that a better way forward is to consider systemic failings running across an organisation. Linked to this is the notion that placing too much responsibility on companies and the senior personnel at their helm is a disincentive to the entrepreneurial spirit that allows business to flourish. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Death; Directors; Gross negligence manslaughter; Health and safety; Statutory manslaughter; Workplace injury",,"Dobson, A.; Business Accountability and Responsibility Centre, University of South Wales, Newport, United Kingdom; email: Alexandra.dobson@southwales.ac.uk",,,1754243X,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 153 respondents (45 per cent Omanis and 55 per cent expatriates) shared their expectations which were compared with documentary evidence from core large and medium-sized enterprises' CSR practice in Oman. Findings - On average, CSR mean scores exhibited similarity for most respondent groups except for Omanis, young people, and those with high school or lower education who scored less, indicating a general lack of awareness of CSR. Society in Oman seems to expect corporations to provide ""safe and reliable products/services"", ""appropriately treat employees"", ""behave ethically"", and be ""committed to social responsibility"".

Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative phenomenological study used a Van Kaam method as modified by Moustakas with in-depth, semi-structured interviews to explore the factors and priorities considered by SME executives in CSR decisions. Findings - The study revealed that small business executives are generally influenced by personal feelings, financial conditions, friends and family, and religion in making decisions on CSR activities. In addition, these decision-makers prefer local CSR activities, are concerned with the environment, and go beyond the basic legal requirements. The sole focus on profits was not evident in these small business executives.

Findings: Criteria relating to corporate social responsibility (CSR) proved to be a significant weakness for Nigerian suppliers, as most of the bidding organisations were unable to show evidence of, for example, payment of taxes and insurance for their employees. However, suppliers of services, in general, performed better than suppliers of products. Practical implications: Suppliers of products and services in Nigeria need to improve their performance with respect to CSR in particular. As most of these organisations are small businesses, they had previously tended to avoid the costs related to CSR implementation. Furthermore, large customer organisations can utilise their buying power and influence to encourage their suppliers to change their corporate strategies and practices.

The article has three goals. First, it provides an overview of the varying conceptualizations and paradigms underpinning CSR. Second, it presents an analogy relating commonalities and deviations between Islam and some of the basic international CSR paradigms. Third, it proposes a novel model of Islamic CSR based on the Islamic legislation (shar'iah) and applies it to an MNC with explicit application of Islamic CSR. Design/methodology/approach - A case study of an explicitly Islamic-abiding corporation has been investigated to test for the applicability of the proposal model. Semi-structured interviews have been employed with both the CSR and the HR Heads in Egypt. In addition, various corporate communications have been also utilized in this study. Findings - The research reflects upon international paradigms of CSR versus the Islamic one, highlighting its origins and providing an analogy among both perspectives. Also, a new model is developed and further put into action by the case study employed. Further research is needed to assess further the generalizability of the proposed model, especially with companies operating in Muslim-majority countries and, hence, with potential implicit application of Islamic CSR. Research limitations/implications - Generalization of the model cannot be generated at this stage of the model development. Further large-scale empirical research is needed for further development of the proposed model.

The business case for CSR investigates the potential for economic value in socially oriented company actions. This paper aims to examine one key CSR initiative, that of employee skill-based volunteerism. Design/methodology/approach - Researchers consider three current applications of employee skill-based volunteerism and the potential to generate company economic value. Findings - This concept paper suggests employee skill-based volunteerism aligns with the four components of the business case for CSR, including the enhancement of company reputation, the reduction of costs and risk, the achievement of business strategy, and the creation of learning and partnership. Research limitations/implications - This paper focuses on three companies' employee skill-based volunteerism programs and does not reflect the comprehensiveness of a meta-analysis. Hence conclusions are limited in generalization. Further investigation of company CSR program initiatives and their impact both short term and long term is suggested.

By considering the role of employee skill-based volunteerism, this paper considers this specific CSR initiative and its potential for generating economic benefits for a company. Originality/value - The authors suggest that employee skill-based volunteerism can serve as a unique differentiating strategy employing the knowledge, skills and abilities of employees that are specific to any given company.

However, a substantial WF/P ratio growth can be seen in 2008 - 27.81 per cent - and, above all, of 36.08 per cent in 2009. This has allowed a certain mitigation of the decline of the allocations. In addition, a change has taken place in the distribution of the welfare fund, the amount for health and social care being bigger than the amount spent on culture and leisure. Social implications - This paper aims to highlight the impact that the process of mergers and acquisitions can have on the survival and the social commitment of the SBs.

Findings - The authors conclude that GRI has resulted in some standardization of corporate social and environmental reporting, particularly in terms of format, but their approach to indicators is unlikely to produce high quality information that is relevant, comparable, complete and accessible to all stakeholders. Regulation and reputation seem to be the main drivers for improving the quality of ESG reporting. Global companies operating in industries with higher reputation risks had the highest levels of disclosure. Furthermore, reporting seems to be oriented to satisfying the demands of shareholders and investors rather than those of other stakeholders.

Is the relationship between financial transparency and CSR activities affected by the business group affiliation and ownership structure of firms? Research Findings/Insights: CSR ratings are negatively correlated with the level of earnings management when all firms are considered. However, the relationship is weaker for chaebol firms and firms with highly concentrated ownership, which suggests that CSR practices can be abusively used by those firms to conceal their poor earnings quality. The adverse use of CSR is discouraged if the fraction of shares owned by institutional investors is high. However, no evidence is found for a similar moderating effect for foreign investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that the business group affiliation and the ownership structure of a firm are important factors in determining the managerial incentives to engage in CSR, which can explain the mixed results reported in previous research. In addition, the possibility of a simultaneous relationship between CSR and other key firm characteristics, such as earnings quality, should be considered when conducting research on CSR. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides the insight to investors and other stakeholders that the managerial incentives behind CSR activities can differ depending on a firm's characteristics. Care must be taken when assessing the CSR activities, in particular, of firms with weak corporate governance. For policy makers, it is important to ensure that CSR-related disclosures by firms are based on actual plans and are not intended to deceive stakeholders, especially when the firms are not actively monitored by external shareholders. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Business groups; Corporate governance; Corporate social performance; Financial disclosure; Institutional shareholder",,"Choi, B.B.; Newcastle Business School, University of Newcastle, University Drive, Callaghan, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia; email: bobae.choi@newcastle.edu.au",,,09648410,,,,"English","Corp.

This increase has been spurred on by legislation in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere designed to promote orphan drug development. In this article, we examine the drivers of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in orphan drug markets and the extent to which biopharmaceutical firms engage in these activities with a strategic orientation. The unique context of orphan drugs constitutes a research opportunity to test the applicability of existing theoretical perspectives on CSR and strategic CSR. Using Schwartz and Carroll's (Bus Ethics Q, 13(4):503-530, 2003) three-domain approach to CSR and the literature on strategic CSR as a theoretical background, we employ a combination of semi-structured interviews and a quantitative website content analysis to study practices of biopharmaceutical firms in the United States and European Union. Our findings show that both US- and EU-based companies engaged in orphan drugs development perceive their involvement as a responsible business activity beyond the economic dimension of CSR. However, for the majority of these companies their CSR activities do not qualify as strategic according to the criteria established in the literature. We also find significant differences between larger and smaller firms in their use of CSR. Based on these findings, we make several suggestions regarding orphan drug legislation and other measures that might help firms exploit strategic CSR benefits. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biopharmaceutical industry; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); European Union (EU); Orphan drugs; Rare diseases; Strategic CSR; United States (US)",,"Wokutch, R.

But little is known about how such dialogs function, and there is a pressing need for theoretical frameworks that can deepen our understanding of how and when these dialogs generate value for both the company and society.

The framework reveals that virtual CSR dialogs generate value based on (a) the extent to which stakeholders identify with the community of dialog participants, and (b) the heightened expectations that stakeholders develop. It also outlines the key characteristics that influence the value generating capacity of virtual CSR dialogs.

We examine the combined effect of these actions, estimate the contribution of both elements separately, and the influence of concentrated equity ownership, corporate governance, and the institutional environment. We also evaluate whether the effect is persistent or transitory. Research Findings/Insights: For a sample of 1,029 firms from 21 countries, our findings demonstrate that engagement combined with the threat of expulsion from the FTSE4Good index doubles the probability that a firm failing to meet the environmental management criteria in 2002 would comply by 2005. The higher compliance rate for the firms receiving engagement persists until the end of our study in 2010. We also find that compliance is positively associated with low levels of concentrated ownership and with firms based in coordinated rather than liberal market economies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results contribute to the understanding of the complexities of governance, where decision makers are constrained or influenced by equity holders, the firm's governance system, institutional arrangements, and collective engagement by institutional equity holders. Our findings are consistent with both institutional and agency issues impacting on decision making. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study suggests that engagement via a responsible investment index reinforced by the threat of public expulsion from the index provides an effective route for large-scale collaborative investor engagement on corporate social responsibility issues targeting large and internationally diverse firms. It also demonstrates why regulators may wish to encourage engagement of this type to achieve social benefits. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management; FTSE4Good; Investor engagement; Responsible investment indices",,"Rodionova, T.; The University of Edinburgh Business School, 29 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, United Kingdom; email: tatiana.rodionova@ed.ac.uk",,,09648410,,,,"English","Corp.

The paper is based on an analysis of 142 company annual reports required by the new Danish regulation regarding CSR reporting, plus 10 interviews with first-time reporting companies and six interviews with companies that failed to comply with the new law. It is concluded that coercive pressures from government have an impact on CSR reporting practices. Further, the analysis finds traces of mimetic isomorphism which inspires a homogenisation in CSR reporting practices. Finally, it is argued that non-conformance with the new regulatory requirements is not solely about conscious resistance but may also be caused by, for example, lack of awareness, resource limitations, misinterpretations, and practical difficulties. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Institutional theory; Performance measurement; Reporting","corporate strategy; environmental economics; institutional framework; performance assessment; regulatory framework; theoretical study; Denmark","Pedersen, E.R.G.; Copenhagen Business School, Center for Corporate Social Responsibility (cbsCSR), Porcelaenshaven 18, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; email: erp.ikl@cbs.dk",,,09644733,,,,"English","Bus.

The controversy that surrounds certain industries can sharply polarise public opinion and debate. In this article, we employ legitimacy theory and morality policy to show how one industry sector (the electronic gaming machine sector as part of the wider gambling industry) is subject to this reaction. We suggest that the difficulty in establishing legitimacy surrounding CSR practices in this sector is related to morality policy, whereby ideology and personal values play important roles in dividing opinion. Thus, gambling is often framed as an activity that is morally and ethically problematic. To show how this can manifest, we examine the veracity of two state-funded studies in Australia used in the development of gambling policy and their subsequent adoption in academic research. We highlight methodological, analytical and reporting issues in these studies that normally should be identified by those using such findings. The significance is that when morality policy and conflict surrounding legitimacy are involved, then it can explain why adherence to normative research standards is potentially lowered. Our theoretical posture leads us to further speculate that the adoption and communication of CSR in electronic gambling will be contested by opponents of the industry. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Electronic gambling; Legitimacy theory; Morality policy; Stakeholders",,"Michelson, G.; School of Management, Edith Cowan University, Perth, WA, 6027, Australia; email: g.michelson@ecu.edu.au",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

This paper investigates these processes in the context of employee downsizing. It identifies a range of argumentation techniques which form a basis for broader strategies: rationalisation, normalisation, inevitability and emotional/moral distancing, which corporations used to (re)construct a contested business practice as a positive, routine management strategy or something that cannot be avoided. The paper maintains that the scale and frequency of the questionable undertaking may have an impact on whether the company applies the moralisation strategy, in terms of making an effort to discursively integrate expressions of feeling or a sense of 'duty' in the text. Moreover, the paper goes on by suggesting that, even if references to these elements remained succinct, their presence in the text can still be seen as opening up the potential for dissension and change, as they place the elements of duty and caring in the proximity of the 'natural laws' of neoclassical economics, such as, the need for profit, unlimited growth and norms of efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Annual report; Argumentation; Corporate social responsibility; Critical discourse analysis; Downsizing; Socially questionable business undertaking",,"Vuontisjärvi, T.69 Sidney Grove, NE4 5PD, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom; email: taru@vuontisjarvi.fsnet.co.uk",,,09565221,,,,"English","Scand.

Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of large listed corporations from 2002 to 2009, we find that, on average, better-governed corporations tend to pursue a more socially responsible agenda through increased CSR practices. We also find that a combination of CSR and CG practices has a stronger positive effect on CFP than CSR alone, implying that CG positively influences the CFP-CSR relationship. Our results are robust to controlling for different types of endogeneities, as well as alternative CFP, CG and CSR proxies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The paper generally contributes to the literature on CG, CSR, and CFP. Specifically, we make two main new contributions to the extant literature by drawing on new insights from an overarching neo-institutional framework. First, we show why and how better-governed corporations are more likely to pursue a more socially responsible agenda. Second, we provide evidence on why and how CG might strengthen the link between CFP and CSR. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings have important implications for corporate regulators and policy-makers.

However, much of this information mirrors the paper versions of financial reports, often with little attempt to enhance the decision usability of the data, providing a so called 'first generation' of online reporting (ICAEW, 2004). eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) has been designed to provide a 'second generation' of online reporting, specifically to enhance the usability of the data. Documents rendered in XBRL are digitally-enabled so that it is easier for stakeholders to extract information directly into spreadsheets, or any other XBRL-enabled analysis software, without the need to re-key data thus providing significant improvements in information flows and enhancing inter-company comparability.XBRL consortia have spent more than 15 years promulgating the use of this technology within the business and government communities. However, despite their efforts XBRL has not become widely diffused, there is little stakeholder engagement and very few organisations have voluntarily adopted XBRL in practice.The results of a questionnaire survey in the UK indicate that awareness of XBRL, and second generation reporting more generally, resides in key champions but there is little diffusion outside this narrow set of stakeholders. Regulatory engagement seems to be the only impetus for diffusion and better channels of communication within stakeholder networks, such as between regulators, preparers, users and the XBRL community are needed. This paper suggests that currently the supply-push for XBRL is failing to produce effective use of this technology in the UK. Greater regulatory commitment is now needed to create an impetus for XBRL such as creating tools and making publicly available, accessible, repositories of XBRL data. Unless this happens, diffusion will not occur, and the demand-pull which is now needed will vanish and XBRL will fade and die. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Diffusion; Financial reporting; Internet reporting; Stakeholder Engagement; XBRL",,"Dunne, T.; University of Dundee, School of Business, Dundee DD1 4HN, United Kingdom; email: t.m.dunne@dundee.ac.uk",,,08908389,,,,"English","Br.

This deficit may lead to a decline in the social acceptance of the business firm and its corporate political activities and, thus, to a loss of corporate legitimacy. Under these conditions corporations may compensate for the emerging democratic deficit and reestablish their legitimacy by internalizing democratic mechanisms within their organizations, in particular in their corporate governance structures and procedures.

We discuss how bounded stakeholder salience creates non-economic co-dependencies between family firms and their stakeholders that are likely to endure over time.

They are likely to contribute to higher levels of accountability and awareness within corporations in respect of the negative impact of business activities on human rights. However, we identify tensions between the idea that the respect of human rights is a perfect moral duty for corporations and the Principle's 'human rights due diligence' requirement. We argue that the effectiveness of the 'human rights due diligence' is in many respects dependent upon the moral commitment of corporations. The Principles leave room for an instrumental or strategic implementation of due diligence, which in some cases could result in a depreciation of the fundamental norms they seek to promote. We reveal some limits of pragmatic approaches to coping with business-related human rights abuses. As these limits become more apparent, not only does the case for further progress in international and extraterritorial human rights law become more compelling, but so too does the argument for a more forceful discussion on the moral foundations of human rights duties for corporations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate responsibility; Human rights; Moral duties; Moral rights; Ruggie Principles",,"Demuijnck, G.; EDHEC Business School, Lille, France; email: geert.demuijnck@edhec.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: This research had the collaboration of a company to develop the case study about its volunteering programme and for the collection of data through an electronic questionnaire. Findings: The results indicate a similar hierarchical organisation of the motivations when compared with some previous studies. The volunteers' experience is satisfactory in all aspects, and is positively related to feelings of happiness. However, the results evidence a weak/moderate relation between volunteers' motivations and happiness/satisfaction. Practical implications: More efforts are needed to improve the volunteers' training and formation, which was pointed as the less satisfactory aspect (similarly to other studies). Thus, it is necessary to question the methods usually used in the training provided, which may involve the restructuring of the training plan to adapt it to the employees' needs and to guarantee the quality of the work.

Design/methodology/approach: A research model with three hypotheses was created and tested through linear multiple regression analysis, including 199 brands. The dependent variable, responsible brand image, was obtained from a Swedish consumer survey (n=8,015). The independent variables were measured through content analyses of the brands' webpages. Findings: The findings support that presence of corporate heritage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication is positively related to responsible brand image with consumers. It is notable that the results indicate that corporate heritage identity on its own does not influence positive consumer perception on responsibility, unless it is linked to CSR communication. Research limitations/implications: Previous research has indicated the significance of cultural context on what constitutes effective CSR communication. As this study is limited to a Swedish consumer sample, the authors therefore recommend further research including a wider national context in order to validate the findings. Practical implications: The study and findings can inspire and inform companies how corporate heritage can be utilised in brand communications to facilitate CSR credibility among consumers. Originality/value: By introducing history and heritage as a perspective on CSR communication and responsible brand image, the paper adds to the growing literature on corporate heritage identity and branding.

Using US KLD data, we demonstrate that, as theorised, markets place a positive value on CSP that is not detected by conventional returns-based tests. Our conclusion is that researchers who are interested in the question of whether engagement with a corporate social responsibility agenda is a value-enhancing activity for a company (as argued by some stakeholder theorists) or value destructive (as argued by Friedman, The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits, The New York Times Magazine, 1970), need to look beyond returns-based tests to answer the research question posed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social performance; Valuation methods",,"Gregory, A.; Xfi Centre for Finance and Investment, University of Exeter Business SchoolUnited Kingdom; email: a.gregory@ex.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

The focus on CSR in the tourism sector has emerged owing to the existence of a critical mass of consumers' willingness to pay a premium for such initiatives. A problem, however, emerges in the production of CSR activities from the supply-side. This is because entrepreneurs exhibit a strong free riding behaviour in their provision. The theoretical results illustrate that the existence of voluntary certification schemes would provide firms with a more efficient framework for undertaking CSR efforts.","Certification schemes; Corporate social responsibility; Information asymmetries","asymmetric information; certification; competitiveness; corporate strategy; industrial competition; theoretical study; tourism economics; willingness to pay","Mitrokostas, E.; Department of Economics, Portsmouth Business School, University of Portsmouth, Portland Street, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, United Kingdom; email: evangelos.mitrokostas@port.ac.uk",,,13548166,,,,"English","Tour.

Additionally, extensive research in an attempt to identify the relationship between corporate social and financial performance by investigating companies' annual and financial reports has shown largely inconclusive results. This paper therefore aims to investigate the insights of corporate executives on both the issues of the social responsibilities of business and the link between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financial performance. With respect to corporate executives, the authors investigated if there are differences between the perceptions of executives of FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share. Design/methodology/approach: The data was collected via online survey and semi-structured interviews with the executives of FTSE All-Share companies. Out of 531 executives, the authors received 82 responses of a response rate of 17 per cent. They contacted 178 executives representing FTSE 100 companies and received 29 responses of a response rate of 17.6 per cent. In order to build a phenomenological approach to this study, the authors interviewed four executives to document their opinions and thoughts. Findings: The results indicate that the business world holds a narrow view of its social responsibilities whilst maintaining that it is possible to be both profitable and respectful to its stakeholders. The analysis also reveals that socially responsible businesses employ CSR in pursuit of their commercial interests and consider it to be their competitive advantage. Moreover, the business seems to have integrated CSR into all its operations and activities and considers it as a necessity rather than luxury, which suggests that CSR and financial performance are in synergy. Originality/value: One major contribution of this study is the difference analysed between perceptions of executives of FTSE 100 and other FTSE All-Share companies on whether CSR policies and activities are implemented only when extra financial resources are available. This might suggest that FTSE 100 companies are more likely to have already integrated CSR into their business strategy and therefore devote financial resources to their CSR programs. Other FTSE All-Share companies, in contrast, might still be regarding CSR as an add-on and therefore spend monies on CSR only when they have extra financial resources available. The similar explanation can be offered for the difference between perceptions of executives of FTSE 100 and other FTSE All-Share companies as to whether implementation of CSR policies and activities will increase overheads, increase share prices in the following years and help raise new capital. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Executive; FTSE companies; Perception; Profit; Profitability; Social responsibility; Stakeholders",,"Samy, M.; Leeds Business School, Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds, United Kingdom; email: m.a.samy@leedsmet.ac.uk",,,20408021,,,,"English","Sustainability Account.

The paper concludes by urging luxury-fashion businesses to sustain their success through 'deep' corporate social responsibility (CSR), adding voice to the developing conversation that seeks to change the scope of the critique of marketing practice beyond the economic and competitive advantages that CSR delivers. © 2013 © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","corporate social responsibility; harm chain; institutional theory; luxury fashion; value co-creation",,"Carrigan, M.; The Centre for Trust and Ethical Behaviour (CETEB), Coventry University Business School Environment and Society, Priory Street, Coventry CV1 5FB, United Kingdom; email: marylyn.carrigan@coventry.ac.uk",,,0267257X,,,,"English","J.

BEE is a form of socio-economic affirmative action championed by the African National Congress (ANC)-led government to address historical imbalances in business participation and ownership in South Africa. We find that block ownership and institutional ownership are negatively associated with the extent of BEE disclosures, whereas government ownership, board diversity (age, education, ethnicity, nationality and occupation), board size and non-executive directors are positively related to the extent of BEE disclosures. By contrast, dual board leadership structure and gender diversity are not significantly associated with BEE disclosures. Our results are robust when controlling for firm-level characteristics, fixed-effects and alternative disclosure proxies.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors gathered data from GRI database as well as from Compustat. They use both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Findings: The authors find that there is no statistically significant difference in the likelihood of sustainability reporting between family and non-family firms of the S&P 500. They document important associations among the propensity to issue sustainability reports, the level of details of sustainability reports and certain firm-specific and industry characteristic variables. Research limitations/implications: This study is focused on S&P 500 firms and may not be generalizable to smaller firms. Differences among family firms such as stock ownership and management control may affect sustainability reporting and are important topics for future research. Practical implications: Society should be aware of the motivations and incentives that govern sustainability reporting decisions by both family and non-family firms. The authors show that both family and non-family companies use voluntary disclosure in general and sustainability reporting in particular as a way of mitigating regulatory, political and litigation costs. Originality/value: No prior study, to the authors' knowledge, has examined the association between sustainability reporting and the family status of firms.

They are also required to demonstrate that they are responsible to all their customers, including those who experience impairment and/or disability as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies. One strategy to address stadium accessibility and wider-equity issues for spectators with disabilities (SwD) and their companions, is through appointing the 'incipient managerial position' of the Disability Liaison Officer (DLO). This exploratory paper is motivated by a paucity of studies examining impairment and/or disability within sport management. Drawing on institutional theory (. DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Friedland & Alford, 1991) this paper seeks to address this gap by examining the implementation of disability legislation in professional football within England, Germany and Spain. This paper critically reviews both the actions of the governing bodies and clubs to interpret and implement services for Spectators with Disabilities (SwD). Our findings revealed a significant variance in the depth of policy implementation between these countries. This variation was due to the relationship between the prevailing institutional logic and the management of accessibility which resulted, or did not result in isomorphism occurring.

Compared to previous studies that have considered the influence of board diversity and CEO gender on corporate philanthropy, this study introduces the concept of operational diversity, which is the implementation of diversity programs at management, employee, and supply chain levels, and further, it explains why operational diversity influences corporate philanthropy, by using the premises of resource dependence theory. Second, this study also investigates the influence of board diversity on corporate philanthropy. Third, this study uses a large sample of U.S. firms over the period of 1991-2009 and tries to mitigate possible omitted variables and endogeneity problems that are often overlooked in previous research. We demonstrate that firms with operational diversity programs are likely more dependent on a broad variety of resources and give more to community as a strategic maneuver; hence, operational diversity is a better indicator for predicting future corporate giving than board diversity alone. However, having a woman or a member of a minority as a company's chief executive officer is not sufficient to impact its charitable giving. A battery of robustness tests support our conclusion and confirm that our results are not driven by a firm's general corporate social responsibility (CSR) score, gender or independence of board members, or firm ownership. This paper will assist researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders in deepening their understanding of the predictors of corporate giving. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Board of directors; Corporate philanthropy; Operational diversity; Resource dependence theory",,"Kabongo, J.

We show that the effect of stakeholders is phase-specific and that role clarity as a measure of PPM maturity affects the nature of the relationship between the IoE of stakeholders and portfolio success. The effects of the IoE of senior managers on success are not clearly positive with regard to strategic portfolio structuring and are even negative in operative portfolio steering in established PPM systems. In immature PPM systems, line managers tend to take advantage of their position in resource management. Surprisingly, the influence of portfolio managers in portfolio steering is insignificant. Altogether, this paper shows the diverse effect of the IoE of stakeholders on portfolio success.

However, few if any business schools have any systematic or critical human rights content in their accounting and business curricula. This oversight is increasingly problematic as concern grows over the burgeoning size and power of multinational corporations in relation to nation states, cases where large multinational corporations have been complicit in human rights violations, and increasing corporate roles in the provision of state services. This shift of human rights duties, responsibilities and accountability from nation states to corporations has resulted in a number of new United Nations initiatives, voluntary standards and international protocols to bring the UNDHR to bear on business activity. This paper explores how the universal human rights apparatus and discourse is impacting corporations' responsibilities for the protection and promotion of human rights and sustainable development. The emerging business and human rights discourse presents a number of challenges to the dominant ideology taught in business schools and is likely to be resisted. This paper presents a moral and pragmatic case for incorporating human rights into business and accounting education at tertiary and professional levels. It also outlines the principles that should underpin attempts to effectively integrate human rights into the accounting and business curricula as well as exploring the articulation between the human rights and sustainability discourses. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","globalization; guiding principles; Human rights; professions; public interest; sustainability",,"McPhail, K.; Department of Accounting, La Trobe University, Bundoora 3086, VIC, Australia; email: k.mcphail@latrobe.edu.au",,,09639284,,,,"English","Account.

A third dimension that is critical for the hospitality industry is behavior above and beyond the specific job description that is directed at customers. While most OCB studies have considered what behaviors are essential to corporate citizenship, but specific behaviors might be culturally bound. To avoid cultural issues, a more effective approach is to analyze the targets of citizenship behavior, that is, the organization, coworkers, and customers. A study of 240 hotel workers in China found support for a three-leg model of OCB, combining behavior aimed at these targets: at the organization itself, at coworkers, and at customers. Citizenship behavior aimed at the organization includes such activities as promoting a hotel's products and making favorable comments about the property outside of work. Citizenship behavior in support of coworkers includes assisting them as needed and taking time to listen to coworkers' concerns. Customer-focused OCB includes such activities as maintaining a positive attitude at work and performing duties carefully and accurately.

This study aims to examine construction practitioners' collective cognition of value to determine how their facilitation may bias this intent. A value continuum is contributed. Design/methodology/approach - Critique of the design quality indicator (the primary value agenda instrument) finds that it overemphasises objective value, confirming the need for practitioners to help stakeholders develop broader understanding of value. The freelisting technique of cultural anthropology is adopted to model practitioners' collective cognition of value and, thus, their bias over this process. The standard freelisting protocol is followed. Findings - Practitioners' collective understanding is found to comprise related concepts that resolve to a one dimensional 'value continuum' with subjective and objective terminals and which fully embodies value agenda intent. In contrast, the concepts articulated by the design quality indicator are biased towards the objective value continuum terminal, confirming the need for practitioners to facilitate stakeholder exploration of the full continuum if the value agenda is to be fully addressed. Research limitations/implications - The value continuum only reflects the views of a small but typical sample of construction practitioners. Further work must characterise model completeness and consistency through the supply chain. Originality/value - This is the first work to derive an empirical model of construction practitioners' collective understanding of value. It achieves this by the novel linking of a cognitive modelling technique from cultural anthropology with an emic interpretation of the results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Building design; Construction industry; Design quality indicator; Stakeholder engagement; United Kingdom; Value continuum; Value theory","Building design; Design Quality Indicators; Stakeholder engagement; United kingdom; Value continuum; Value theory; Supply chains; Construction industry","Thomson, D.S.; Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, United Kingdom; email: d.s.thomson@lboro.ac.uk",,,09699988,,,,"English","Eng.

The study deepens the existing conceptualizations of the CSR construct and demonstrates how rankings of the CSR components are not necessarily fixed but rather vary due to different cultural values, national wealth, institutional conditions, organizational factors, and public sensitivity toward economic, social and environmental concerns. The study draws attention to the decline of corporate altruism in economic hard times and highlights some main obstacles, such as costs, difficulty to track CSR investment or practices to actual returns, segregation between the generic CSR concept and firm-industry specific competitive contexts, lack of support from top management, and lack of strategic guidance regarding where and how to focus on a large scope of CSR issues. Findings suggest that the extent firms are willing to compromise short-term profit maximization for the larger good of society is likely to vary across borders and among firms of different nationalities. Cultural values and institutional conditions emerge to shape the managerial CSR values and priorities, thereby jointly influencing their strategic CSR decision-making. Cultural values, national wealth, organizational factors and the firm-industry specific legal, regulatory context also influence a firm's predisposition toward relatively short-term vis-à-vis long-term returns to its shareholders and managerial inclinations about their personal moral obligations to larger society. Based on existing literature, empirical findings and firm-industry specific cases, this study offers a cross-cultural framework of CSR strategic options that firms can assess, compose, and implement in the context of international human resource management (IHR). Since many of the CSR issues have a direct link to the human side of business, this study demonstrates that strategic IHR has a key role to play in helping the firm identify, prioritize, and achieve CSR goals, thereby improving the firm-industry specific social and environmental conditions domestically and across borders. This study highlights a knowledge gap between the HR professionals from advanced societies and their counterparts in emerging economies regarding how CSR is integrally related to sustainability,benefits to the larger society, and competitive advantage of the firm, which opens the door for a special role of MNCs' IHR functions in formulation, communication, training, integrating, monitoring, enforcement, and continuous improvement of an organization's CSR vision, moral standards and strategic commitment. IHR will thereby become well positioned as a potential unifier to coordinate these CSR efforts internally and externally. Suggestions for future research are discussed and practical implications of the CSR construct and strategic options are provided.","Corporate social responsibility components; Culture; Emerging economies; High-tech MNCs; International human resource management; Regulatory environment; Strategic options",,"Yang, N.; San Francisco State UniversityUnited States",,,15441458,,,,"English","Acad.

Surprisingly, one kind of risk is often overlooked: reputational risk. It is critical to recognise the risk potential that impacts on the reputation of the organisation. Furthermore, managers require an appropriate tool set to control it. The present paper aims to have a twin focus: first, it will lay out the basic premises behind corporate reputation, reputational risk, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Second, the practical implications will be addressed that lead to a substantial teaching component. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper is based on two research stages. Initially, the authors adopted the ""reflective practitioner"" philosophy that aimed at discovering the common beliefs in practice that explain working processes and management thought. In particular, they explored the foundation of CSR, reputation and risk management with specialists in dedicated workshops (electronics, energy, life sciences, telecommunications and defence industries, located at different stages of the supply chain). To gain more insight, the authors subsequently conducted in-depth interviews in these topic areas with key informants. The combination allowed them methodological triangulation. Findings: Reputation can be created and controlled as soon as its nature is fully understood (Reputational Owner). Interestingly, it is a transceiving business phenomenon that crosses organizational boundaries. Spillover effects can thus be observed at all stages of the supply chain by mere business association (Reputational Borrower). Reputation can range from positive to negative extremes and needs to be managed. The results of the authors' exploratory work are presented as quotations to provide the substance of the current and relevant subject. Research limitations/implications: The present work is exploratory in nature. Quantitative research methods are now required to validate and substantiate the findings. Practical implications: CSR is a contemporary foundation to mitigate reputational risk throughout the supply chain. The authors outline the reputational risk factors in this context and the ways of managing those. Social implications: In the market place, reputation is a reflection of the supply chain offering (products, services), communication (promotion, PR), and action (behaviour and views expressed). Consumers adopt supply chain reputation as a yardstick when making purchase decisions. It is therefore critical to manage reputational risk in the supply chain and this paper outlines the cause and effect relationships that this topic entails in modern society. Originality/value: This paper discusses the importance of reputational risk in the supply chain. It also explains the ways it can be mitigated via CSR. This is the management baseline that adds tremendous value for theory builders and present and future managers.

This transfer is more pronounced when a subsidiary is apparently unconnected to an MNE, yet is controlled by an MNE's headquarters through the appointment of the subsidiary's board members; the institutional environment of the MNE's home country enforces compliance; and the degree of institutional enforcement, vigilance, and sanctions for noncompliance in the subsidiary's host country is low.

They are typically embedded in local communities and therefore well placed to influence community wellbeing. While there has been considerable theoretical and empirical analysis of corporate citizenship and corporate social responsibility (CSR), the nature of micro-business community responsibility (mBCR) remains relatively under-explored. This article presents findings from an exploratory study of mBCR that examined the approaches, motivations and barriers of this phenomenon. Analysis of data from 36 semi-structured interviews with micro-business owner-operators in the Australian city of Brisbane revealed three mBCR approaches, suggesting an observable mBCR typology. Each mBCR type was at least partly driven by enlightened self-interest (ESI). In addition to a pure ESI approach, findings revealed ESI combined with philanthropic approaches and ESI combined with social entrepreneurial approaches. The combination of doing business and doing good found amongst participants in this study suggests that many micro-business owner-operators are supporters of their local communities and, therefore, driven by more than profit. This study provides a fine-grained understanding of micro-business involvement in community wellbeing through a lens of responsible business behaviour. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Micro-business; Micro-business community responsibility; Small business social responsibility; Social entrepreneurship",,"Campin, S.; Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; email: sue.campin1@bigpond.com",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a survey of 95 consumers in each country to investigate attitudes to CSR platforms and CSR initiatives and responses to CSR-based marketing strategies (in terms of attitude to the company and purchasing intent). Findings: The study found similar attitudes across nationalities to both CSR platforms and CSR initiatives, with greater importance assigned to CSR reflecting legal and ethical (rather than philanthropic) concerns. (Some) CSR-based marketing strategies, reflecting an ethical (people/planet) concern, led to significantly more positive attitudes to the company and higher purchasing intent. The study found some cross-cultural variation in the extent to which different CSR-based marketing strategies influenced consumer outcomes. Research limitations/implications: This is an exploratory study, limited to highly educated consumers. The study provides indications that stakeholder expectations in emerging and developed economies may be more similar than previously suggested. The philanthropic platform conventionally pursued in Indian business may not be the most effective way to engage (all segments of) Indian consumers. Findings suggest it is important that companies monitor stakeholders' CSR attitudes to ensure that CSR policy orientations meet stakeholder expectations.

Through corporate social reporting, the social and environmental effects of companies' economic actions are communicated to interest groups. However, the information contained in financial and social reports tends to be presented quite separately from that in the others, and this may lead to confusion among users. Therefore, several major companies have introduced an integrated reporting system, which coherently summarizes the information available, thus making stakeholders participants in business management. Corporate governance mechanisms such as the Board of Directors play an important role in good practices of corporate social responsibility, implementing policies of stakeholder engagement, including processes to achieve holistic transparency. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the influence played by certain features of the Board of Directors in the degree of information integration presented by leading non-financial multinational firms. Specifically, we examined 568 companies from 15 countries, for the period 2008-2010. The results obtained show that growth opportunities, the size of a company and its management bodies, together with gender diversity, are the most important factors in the integrated dissemination of information.

Its contribution is in its focus at the level of the individual employee and in its challenge to assumptions about the relationship between individual and organisational motives for corporate social responsibility implementation. It is argued that effective implementation of corporate social responsibility requires organisations to consider both the role of learning and unlearning.

The paper also examines factors influencing the CSR disclosures before and after the aforementioned changes. Design/methodology/approach: A self-constructed CSR checklist was used to measure the extent and quality of CSR disclosures in the annual reports of 85 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia for the years 2006 and 2009. A number of statistical techniques were employed to assess the CSR disclosures over time, as well as factors influencing the CSR disclosures. Findings: Results revealed a significant overall increase in both the extent and quality of CSR disclosures between the two years covered in the study. In terms of factors influencing the CSR disclosures, director ownership, government ownership and company size were found to be significant in explaining both the extent and quality of CSR disclosures in the year 2006. Board size was found to have a significant relationship with only the extent of CSR disclosures in 2006. However, the results in the year 2009, a period following the policy changes, revealed an improved significant association between board size and CSR disclosures. Research limitations/implications: The results, which showed a significant increasing trend in CSR disclosures following changes in the market place of an emerging economy, lend some support to legitimacy theory's conjecture that CSR disclosures are used to reduce exposure arising from the public. Hence, this study suggests corporate legitimation practices, which were previously renowned in the economically developed countries, also exist in the emerging economies. The empirical observations asserted in this study, however, were only drawn from the Malaysian context. Therefore, future research involving several emerging countries is needed to ascertain the existence of corporate legitimation exercises in the developing countries. Practical implications: In terms of practical implications, the dominance of narrative CSR disclosures in the annual reports as opposed to verifiable information, even after the CSR mandatory requirement, could be due to the absence of a detailed CSR framework for Malaysian public listed companies. Policy makers in Malaysia may therefore want to devise detailed and specific CSR disclosure requirements, rather the current general mandatory requirement, to enhance the quality of CSR disclosures. Originality/value: This study can be considered one of limited empirical studies to have assessed CSR disclosures following changes in the market place. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Annual reports; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility disclosure; Disclosure; Legitimacy theory; Malaysia",,"Haji, A.

The model incorporates individual attitudes towards disruption risks among the manufacturers and the retailers, with the demands for the product associated with the retailers being random.

To answer this question, this article tells the story of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the EU from its beginnings until the present. The EU's role in EU CSR has changed from social-liberal standard-setter to neo-liberal cheerleader and back. This article attempts to explain these shifts. It argues that Europe's institutional diversity hampers standard-setting while economic crises and declining levels of business legitimacy facilitate it. Contention has been fuelled by CSR's inherent ambiguity: is CSR a means to regulate the economy, or a domain of voluntary activity that must remain free of state regulation? Fearful of regulation, business groups - German employers in particular - have forcefully advocated the latter view. In addition to converting EU CSR from social-liberal to neo-liberal, business has neutralized two of the Commission's standard-setting advocates. The financial crisis, the power of arguments and discourse, and the impact of global policy developments in the field of CSR have re-empowered standard-setters.

This study reconstructs five discussions about offshoring production to low-cost countries to understand how moral arguments attack the legitimacy of economic strategies. From these case studies about offshoring, I derive three mechanisms by which moral arguments influence economic decisions. Firstly, moral arguments appeal to values, influencing what their addressee defines as economically rational. Secondly, denouncing management decisions as immoral can deprive managers of valuable social capital and legitimacy within their company, thereby exerting economic pressure. Thirdly, depicting management decisions as immoral can destroy a company's public legitimacy, further exerting economic pressure.

This study has adopted a well-established competency model from human resource management theories as a basis for the theoretical framework to examine the social competencies of construction project managers. This led to the development of a model via the use of a structural equation modelling approach. Four dimensions of social competencies for construction project managers were identified, i.e. working with others, stakeholder management, leading others, and social awareness. Attention to these attributes will help construction project managers to develop their social competencies, and could contribute towards a better performance in their workplace which will in turn improve the performance of the whole organisation.

Data were collected from 203 green innovation project leaders from electronics manufacturers operating in China. The results indicate that knowledge sharing mediates the relationship between green requirements and new green product success as well as that between green requirements and green product and process innovations. Interestingly, the empirical analysis rejects the hypothesized positive influence of green requirements on green product and process innovations as well as that on new green product success, while confirming that there exists a direct and positive association between green requirements and knowledge sharing. The direct positive impact of knowledge sharing is the strongest on green process innovation. This study provides a theoretical basis for investigating the possible determinants in the causal links between green requirements and green innovation success and establishes that knowledge sharing and green process innovation may be the points where leverage can be applied to best secure innovation success.

Whereas traditional public relations theory teaches us that an organization should synchronize its messages across channels, there are no models to understand how an organization may strategically coordinate public relations messaging across traditional and social media platforms. This is especially important in the new media environment where social media (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) are increasingly being used in concert with traditional public relations tools (e.g. press releases) as a part of an organization's stakeholder engagement strategy. This paper seeks to address these issues.

They are closely linked to urban growth and underpin the economic, social and environmental performance of modern cities. At the same time places shape the transformation of such complex infrastructural systems. Effective waste management contributes significantly to public health, environmental sustainability and economic development and it is an inherently urban challenge. Combining insights from urban studies with research on 'systems innovation' and 'sustainable transitions', this paper deals with a transformation towards a more sustainable waste management system in an urban setting. More specifically, the paper describes how Greater Manchester (UK) underwent a transformation from a relatively simple landfill model to a highly complex, multi-technology waste solution based on intensive recycling and composting, and sustainable energy usage. The case is relevant because the UK has long been seen as a laggard when it comes to sustainable waste practices. The 1999 EU landfill directive exerted great pressure to change waste practices in the UK. Against the national trend of incineration with energy recovery, Greater Manchester opted instead for a solution that was deemed more innovative and sustainable, but which involved overcoming significant technological, political and financial challenges. The paper investigates the process that led to this purposive transformation, characterized by a mix of political vision, stakeholder engagement, economies of scale, and the ability of waste disposal managers to gather expertise, resources, political influence and commitment at multiple levels of governance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the article is, through the analysis of the phenomenon of ""waste"", to reveal the situation of waste pickers in the society and the paradoxical relationship between the society and them. The tasks are to formulate and shortly discuss historical aspects of waste, its management and secondary use, through the historical role of waste pickers in the system of waste management; to analyze the concept of waste and its possibilities as an analytic means for the analysis of phenomena in social life; to shortly introduce the subculture of waste pickers, and the symbolic meaning of their work. Waste accompanies humanity from its very beginning. When civilizations develop, waste loses its natural role. It becomes unnecessary trash which is disposed as far as possible from people who creates it. Thus, in the contemporary world waste does not become a part of life for anybody to save the poorest (shadow) layers of society. These layers of society (similarly like waste in the material world) are considered not important, redundant However, like waste goes through the process of decay and gets a new sacred power of creativity, so can the marginalized people, passing through the processes of stigmatization and exclusion, become for the society a new challenge. This challenge can give a possibility that would lead society towards a fuller integration of all its parts and to more mature functioning.","Waste; Waste pickers",,"Petruzyte, D.; Department of Social Work, Faculty of Philosophy, Vilnius University, Universiteto str. 9/1, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania; email: donatai@gmail.com",,,16484460,,,,"English","Transform.

Second, is the CSR orientation of banks focused on areas which are driven by nature of its target markets, such that there is an alignment between CSR orientation and benefits accrued to its stakeholder segments, directly or indirectly? Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze 49 Indian banks (25 public sector, 15 private sector and nine foreign banks) operating in India based on data available from the banks' web sites, annual reports and sustainability/CSR reports (if available). From content analysis, the data were into seven categories - Education, Health, Community Welfare, Entrepreneurship Development, Environment, Market Place, and Rural Development. Findings: The results indicate that CSR orientation of Indian Banks differ only based on ownership, number of employees, and date of its incorporation in the areas of Environment & Rural development (for ownership), Community Welfare, Environment, and Rural development (for number of employees), and Environment, and market place (for date of its incorporation). Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study should be confirmed in future studies since this study is based on qualitative analysis of information shared by banks on their CSR activities and programs. Practical implications: Bank managers need to identify and focus on areas in which CSR orientation can give them more strategic advantage in building relationship with its stakeholders. Doing so would help in meeting the expectations of the stakeholder expectations successfully. Originality/value: This paper contributes to literature in many ways.

Because of this, analysts presume that variations in national-institutional arrangements affect CSR practices. Literature, however, lacks specificity in determining, first, what parts of national political-economic configurations actually affect CSR practices; second, the precise aspects of CSR affected by national-institutional variables; third, how causal mechanisms between national-institutional framework variables and aspects of CSR practices work. Because of this the literature is not able to address to what extent CSR practices are affected by either global or national policies, discourses and economic pressures; and to what extent CSR evolves as either an alternative to or an extension of national-institutional arrangements.

Extending this view of ""environment-as-a-resource,"" I posit that the value of environmental CSR depends on external and internal moderators. First, I argue that external pressure to behave responsibly towards the environment-which has increased dramatically over recent decades-exacerbates the punishment for eco-harmful behavior and reduces the reward for eco-friendly initiatives. This argument is supported by the data: over time, the negative stock market reaction to eco-harmful behavior has increased, while the positive reaction to eco-friendly initiatives has decreased. Second, I argue that environmental CSR is a resource with decreasing marginal returns and insurance-like features.

The first explanation, signaling, proposes that firms use standalone CSR Reports as a signal of their superior commitment to CSR, which suggests firms with stronger social and environmental records will be more likely to issue standalone CSR Reports as compared to those without. The second explanation, greenwashing, proposes that firms use standalone CSR Reports to pose as "" good"" corporate citizens even when they do not have stronger social and environmental records. To provide insight into these explanations we compare the CSR performance scores of firms that issue CSR reports to those firms that do not.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study approach was adopted, using purposive sampling to select seven export garment manufacturers of varying size and business model in Sri Lanka. Primary data was collected through on-site face-to-face interviews with managerial level and operational level informants within each company and through non-participant observation within factory environments. Data analysis was conducted manually. Findings: Adopting SCM principles supports CSR implementation in supplier facilities in global fashion garment supply chains by overcoming the negative effects of retail buying practices. It also progresses supplier CSR performance beyond that which is achievable via a coercive, compliance-based model by encouraging suppliers to be innovative and take ownership of the CSR agenda. Hence, aspects of supply chain relationship management may be more critical in progressing CSR implementation than traditional bureaucratic monitoring and auditing mechanisms. Practical implications: In an industry sector facing unique pressure on cost as well as lead time, fashion retailers must understand how to align CSR implementation with the unique competitive challenges of the sector. Analysing the success of CSR implementation in the Sri Lankan export garment manufacturing industry enables managers to identify barriers and supporting factors to CSR implementation in global fashion supply chains. Originality/value: This paper presents industry-specific data from a key global garment manufacturing country on a commercially sensitive subject. Its contribution to extant literature is the development of a CSR framework that identifies inhibitors and drivers to CSR implementation from a fashion supply chain management perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethical sourcing; Fashion; Supply chain management",,"Perry, P.; Department of Business Management, School of Management and Languages, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; email: p.perry@hw.ac.uk",,,09600035,,,,"English","Int.

More specifically, the study reveals distinct patterns in rhetorical CSR adoption that illustrate the initial hesitation and reluctance of an established elite in the Austrian business community towards the Anglo-American notion of 'explicit' CSR, while non-elite actors who were less favourably positioned in the social order readily embraced the concept. It is in such a sense that CSR is nevertheless instrumentalized to challenge, reinterpret, or explicitly evoke the autochthonous idea of institutionalized social solidarity.

In order to compare these high-level integration discourses against patterns at the level of resource allocation, we analyze nearly 2500 research solicitations from the three European Framework Programmes for R&D during the period 1998-2010. We identify four distinct types of integration (socio-ethical, stakeholder, socio-economic and industrial) that occur either as core or parallel components of R&D solicitations. Quantitative analysis reveals an overall trend towards increasing integration, with requests integrating industrial and socio-economic aspects substantially outnumbering those integrating socio-ethical and stakeholder aspects - by a 2 to 1 margin. Meanwhile, calls for socio-technical integration have become slightly more extensive (ranging across a broader range of research areas addressed), significantly more pervasive (shifting from the periphery to the core of R&D practices), and arguably less diverse (involving a wider variety of integration types) over time. The relative lack of attention to socio-ethical aspects and stakeholder participation in European research is particularly notable given that we focus on potentially controversial areas (life sciences, energy, and nanotechnology), which likely overemphasizes the prevalence of integration throughout the Framework Programmes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results suggest that NGO executives are sceptical of current CSD practice. To them, current CSD is ad hoc and no more than a public relations exercise, lacking credibility. Most importantly, owing to structural constraints NGO executives assign lesser significance to CSD than to direct corporate involvement in social development. They described structural constraints as: high levels of poverty, weak governmental structures, dependence on foreign aid and a small group of local business people, lack of awareness of CSD, and an underdeveloped stakeholder relationship. All of these constraints are embedded within the socio-cultural and political history of Bangladesh. NGO executives believe strongly in action rather than words. They suggest that corporations need to engage in social development and to improve their social performance in order to meet their social and environmental responsibilities to the Bangladeshi people. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bangladesh; Corporate social disclosure; Non-Governmental organisations",,"Momin, M.A.; AUT Business School, Auckland University of Technology, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; email: mahmood.momin@aut.ac.nz",,,01559982,,,,"English","Account.

Using Lievrouw's (2001) information environments (IE) theory, this mixed methods study compares three regional HIV/AIDS information environments in rural Canada. In accordance with IE theory, findings showed regional variation in institutional aspects of HIV/AIDS information environments: health institution service models; resource munificence and technology use; and some measures of social engagement and source availability. Differences were also present in the personal/relational aspects of environments: information network characteristics and levels of interpersonal interaction. However, in divergence from IE theory, regional success rates for answering HIV/AIDS-related questions were similar (86.26-89.34 percent). Furthermore, individual-level factors were more important than network position in predicting participants' success rates. Yet, in line with IE theory, there were regional differences in the barriers that people affected by HIV/AIDS faced when seeking answers to their questions. These unaddressed barriers suggest that further development of IE theory requires incorporation of institutional capacity: provider knowledge, responsiveness, and service availability. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Access to information; Community informatics; Health informatics; HIV/AIDS; Information behavior; Information environments; Rural communities; Social networks",,"Veinot, T.

Donation expenditures could be the most direct measure of managers' willingness to conduct CSR activities, while the voluntary issuance of CSR reports filed with GRI captures a direct signal of managers' willingness to conduct CSR activities. The results of this study provide evidence that firms active in CSR are likely to report earnings of a higher quality. More specifically, after controlling for firm-specific factors, we find that firms with more corporate donations have lower discretionary accruals and greater accounting conservatism. Furthermore, this negative relationship between donation and discretionary accruals is more pronounced when firms voluntarily issue CSR reports. Prior studies have focused on the association between financial performance and CSR activities of firms. However, managerial choices and signals on financial performance with voluntary CSR activities have not been specifically considered. This study adds to the existing literature on CSR by providing evidence of the role of CSR on earnings quality and helps academics and practitioners to understand the role of corporate donations and voluntary CSR disclosures in earnings quality.","Accounting Conservatism; Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure; Discretionary Accruals; Earnings Quality",,"Lee, H.-Y.; Yonsei University, School of Business, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 120-749, South Korea; email: hylee@yonsei.ac.kr",,,08927626,,,,"English","J.

In this article, we saw the need to ellaborate a theoretical model of Business Ethics that was capable of guiding research on Corporate Social Responsibility practices aimed at organizations' internal public. To this end, we analyzed different Business Ethics fields - namely Responsibility Ethics, ethics that reaffirm the principle of humanity and ethics that generate conventional morality, so as to avoid automatic associations with the idea of Corporate Social Responsibility. The theoretical dialogue of these two major constructs (Business Ethics and CSR) with the field of Labor Relations is dealt with in accordance with these three dimensions of ethics. To find out how a company that desires to be socially responsible relates to its employees, there are indicators that are strongly related to key aspects of labor relations, as shown by the UN's Global Compact Agenda. This interface produced the methodological guidelines that conducted research data collection and analysis, pointing out important challenges in this agenda, as well as serving as a basis for further studies in this field. © FECAP.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Global compact; Internal stakeholders; Labor relations",,"Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais - PUC/MG, Av.

However, very few works examine tourism destinations from a network perspective. Networks can be analyzed from either a relationship or a structural perspective. The aim of the present article is to adopt both of these perspectives to assess the different relationships that exist between tourism stakeholders (both private and public) within a specific Italian 3S tourism destination: Costa Smeralda-Gallura in the North-East of the island of Sardinia. Data were gathered from destination management organization (DMO) internal documents, local press, and through a questionnaire completed by a number of tourism organizations chosen from a list provided by the DMO, which at the time was the public body instructed to keep the official register. Our findings describe the Gallura-based destination as a network specifically defined by a relatively low level of density, collaboration, and integration in the relationships between local stakeholders. The study suggests that destination marketers and policy makers should run internal marketing and branding operations in order to enhance their collaboration, and therefore reach a strategic consensus among stakeholders. © 2013 Cognizant Comm.

They illustrate the potential of this research strategy with a comparative case study of processes of responsiveness at four Dutch banks with markedly different governance structures. This study shows how governance systems and structures both enable and constrain corporate responsibility and responsiveness.

Sustainable supply chain initiatives like supplier environmental and social collaboration can play a significant role in achieving the ""triple bottom line"" of social, environmental, and economic benefits. Supplier selection plays an important role in the management of a supply chain. Traditionally, organizations consider criteria such as price, quality, flexibility, etc. when evaluating supplier performance. While the articles on the selection and evaluation of suppliers are abundant, those that consider sustainability issues are rather limited. This paper explores sustainable supply chain initiatives and examines the problem of identifying an effective model based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach (economic, environmental, and social aspects) for supplier selection operations in supply chains by presenting a fuzzy multi criteria approach. We use triangular fuzzy numbers to express linguistic values of experts' subjective preferences. Qualitative performance evaluation is performed by using fuzzy numbers for finding criteria weights and then fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is proposed for finding the ranking of suppliers.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper's sample consists of firms from the 2005 S&P 500 Index. Data on CSR come from Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD), Inc. Data on CFO financial expertise were had collected. Consistent with prior research, experience (tenure), education (masters of business administration degree), and professional experience (certified public accountant designation) are used to measure the CFO's financial expertise. Findings: Using a sample of S&P 500 firms from 2005, it is found that CFO experience (measured by tenure) is positively related to CSR at a significant level. In addition, the results indicate that CSR activities are not related to the CFO's education (measured as a Master's of Business Administration degree) or accounting expertise (measured as certified public accountant designation). The findings suggest that CFOs with more experience engage in more CSR activities than CFOs with less experience. Originality/value: This study is valuable for several reasons: First, the study contributes to both the CSR literature and the CFO financial expertise literature by delivering new evidence on the link between CFO financial expertise and corporate social responsibility. Second, the study provides useful information to boards of directors, corporations and investors on certain CFO characteristics associated with effective CSR. Third, the study provides empirical evidence to support the suggested shift in the CFO's role from accountant to co-driver of a firm's long-term strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CFO financial expertise; Chief executives; Corporate social responsibility; Financial reporting; Social responsibility",,"Sun, L.; Department of Accounting, Miller College of Business, Ball State University, Muncie, IN, United States; email: lsun@bsu.edu",,,1754243X,,,,"English","Int.

CSR arose out of the success of large American corporations of the early 20th century in preventing unionization or significant regulation of their workplaces, a success that required firms to assume responsibility for employee welfare, not only to promote efficiency and prevent a resurgence of labour activism, but also to reassure traditionalists concerned with new white collar employment relations. Corporate executives discovered that positive publicity with regard to personnel policies helped them manage other controversies, so after World War I, some began to extend claims of being responsible employers to argue for a more comprehensive set of social responsibilities. The onset of the Depression and its aftermath reduced the significance of managerial voluntarism for almost a half century, but the rise of neo-liberalism has revived managerial CSR, although once again it may not survive a global crisis. © The Author(s) 2013.","business ethics; corporate social responsibility; labour history; management history",,"Marens, R.; College of Business Administration, Sacramento State University, 6000 J Street, Sacramento, CA 95819, United States; email: marensr@csus.edu",,,13505084,,,,"English","Organization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876231170

Whether such practices are enacted or not depends on (1) the particular features of the social field; (2) the individual managers' socially shaped dispositions and (3) their stock of different forms of capital.

The paper then seeks to examine the impacts of these two antecedents on the management practices of the two key stakeholders (the hotel owner and the customer) and to assess the effects of these practices on organizational performance.

The results from confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were both satisfactory, providing a basis for discussion. Findings: Three main results emerged. First, in model A, the key stakeholder is the hotel investor: both antecedent constructs, trust and commitment, were positively influenced by the organization's stakeholder management practices. However, in model B, the key stakeholder is the customer; trust was the only construct affected by stakeholder management practices.

A legitimacy theory framework is adopted to understand the extent to which corporate governance characteristics, such as managerial ownership, public ownership, foreign ownership, board independence, CEO duality and presence of audit committee influence organisational response to various stakeholder groups. Our results suggest that although CSR disclosures generally have a negative association with managerial ownership, such relationship becomes significant and positive for export-oriented industries. We also find public ownership, foreign ownership, board independence and presence of audit committee to have positive significant impacts on CSR disclosures. However, we fail to find any significant impact of CEO duality. Thus, our results suggest that pressures exerted by external stakeholder groups and corporate governance mechanisms involving independent outsiders may allay some concerns relating to family influence on CSR disclosure practices.

The liberal communist claims (1) that there is no opposition between capitalism and the social good; (2) that all problems are of a practical nature, and hence best solved by corporate engagement and (3) that hierarchies, authority and centralized bureaucracies should be replaced by dynamic structures, a nomadic lifestyle and a flexible spirit. This analysis of the liberal communist has at least two implications for research on CSR. First, it examines the ideological role of CSR by moving beyond a propaganda view, instead offering an ideological reading that focuses on the ways in which CSR seeks to obliterate any existing contradictions between 'philanthropic actions' on the one hand and 'profit-seeking business activities' on the other hand. Second, it demonstrates how critique is not necessarily what corporations seek to avoid, but something that they actively engage in. © The Author(s) 2013.","business ethics; capitalism; corporate social responsibility; ethics; liberal communist; neo-liberalism; Zizek",,"Cederström, C.; Cardiff University, Aberconway Building, Colum Drive, Cardiff, CF10 3EU, United Kingdom; email: cederstromcf@cardiff.ac.uk",,,13505084,,,,"English","Organization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876256765

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis was used to examine websites, annual reports and mission statements of Zimbabwe's hotel groups. Findings: Zimbabwe's hotel groups gave primacy to financial performance rather than social and environmental themes in their CSR reporting. In comparative terms, the hotel groups lag behind some of their developed world's counterparts in CSR reporting. Research limitations/implications: Future studies may examine the actual CSR practices adopted by Zimbabwe's tourism and hospitality sector. Research efforts should also be directed towards producing a framework to guide the effective design of CSR dedicated pages on corporate websites. Practical implications: The research findings suggest that CSR initiatives and reporting are still a peripheral issue among Zimbabwe's hotel groups. A need for legal compulsion and third party verification to enhance the hotel groups' CSR reporting was identified.

Also, results indicate that corporations blend the two forms of CSR communication to create a comprehensive environmental CSR profile that simultaneously enhances their position within the industrial field and offers buffering protection due to intraindustry homogeneity. Competitive advantage language is used to describe the quality, scope, and innovation of their environmental CSR as superior to other companies within their industry, particularly when communicating about technology and innovations regarding conservation efforts and manufacturing processes. Institutional language is used to describe governmental regulations and laws, industry standards for CSR reporting and expenditures, and type of CSR initiatives and partnerships.

Qualitative data gathered at two management consultancy firms demonstrate how CSR discourses and practices serve to construct an idealized image of a socially, ecologically and ethically responsible corporate self.

Design/methodology/approach: The approach is discussing the socio-cultural traditions leading up to the complexities of multiple intersections of identity for women living and working in India, offering a paradigm shift from Western issues of gender equality towards understanding women's empowerment issues within the Indian context. Findings: Indian women are marginalized in their access to education and healthcare, and they are also compromised in their personal and professional development by being undervalued, underemployed and under-rewarded. The social implications are the impact of awareness, changing attitudes and corporate social responsibility interventions towards improving the quality of life of women in India.

Significant suspicion nonetheless remains about the motives and impact of corporations acting in domains traditionally served by government and ""third-sector"" organizations. We argue that such ambivalence undermines the perceived legitimacy of private investments in public goods, and that this fundamental liability of privateness (LOP) constitutes a significant obstacle to corporations acting in the public domain through corporate citizenship initiatives. For multinational corporations (MNCs), the challenges stemming from the LOP are further amplified by the liability of foreignness (LOF) commonly associated with international business operations. We discuss the origins of the LOP and derive implications of the ""dual liability"" of LOP and LOF for partnering choices in MNCs' corporate citizenship programs. We highlight limitations on the set of credible governance mechanisms available to participants in these partnerships, describe a set of alternative governance arrangements that serve to realign incentives among alliance partners, and link these to the severity of the LOP in a particular setting.

To explore how this process plays out, we examine how companies have sought to influence the political debate over climate change in Australia. Through analysis of corporate documents, media coverage and interviews with senior managers, we identify how corporations use practices of campaigning and exemplifying to build a common identity with citizens and synchronize corporate and citizen interests.

Our narrative revolves around a particular focal actor in the anti-mining campaign: a young tribal man who emerged as a passionate spokesperson for the movement, but later became a supporter of the controversial mine. Our findings contribute to a richer understanding of the processes underlying transnational and national anti-corporate mobilization. © The Author(s) 2013.","anti-corporate social movement; astroturfing; boomerang model; national advocacy networks (NANs); process; transnational advocacy",,"Kraemer, R.; Rotterdam School of Management, Department of Business-Society Management, Erasmus University, P.O.

Clients' involvement in controversial activities raises concerns about management integrity and ethics. Moreover, clients involved in such activities are perceived to have higher risk of adverse financial performance. As a result, there is greater potential for financial misstatement, which increases the auditor's perceived business risk. We hypothesize that, given the higher perceived business risk, auditors charge higher fees to clients engaged in controversial activities. Using a unique dataset from Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini, we identify clients that engage in controversial activities related to consumers, employees, the community, and the environment. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that clients involved in controversial corporate activities pay higher audit fees compared to clients not involved in such activities.","Audit fees; Audit pricing; Business risk; Controversial corporate activities; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Financial misstatement",,"Nanyang Technological UniversitySingapore",,,02780380,,,,"English","Auditing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876466562

This paper addresses the joint inventory-transportation problem in a three-echelon social responsible supply chain. A new bi-objective mixed-integer mathematical programming model is developed that its first objective function aims to minimise the total costs including transportation costs and inventory holding and shortage costs, while the second one maximises the social responsibility of the supply chain. To form the second objective function three credible CSR criteria are selected from the CSR measurement frameworks existed in the relevant literature. To show the performance and applicably of the proposed model an illustrative example is used. The illustrative example is solved by GAMS optimisation software and the corresponding results as well as some managerial implications are reported in the paper.

However, the availability and quality of modern medical care remain quite poor for many Chinese, particularly those in rural and western regions. Problems are exacerbated by various inefficiencies and widespread corruption in the healthcare delivery system. Moreover, because access to healthcare coverage is based on one's registered permanent residence, the great migration of workers to jobs in the more wealthy eastern part of the country has aggravated medical care access problems. Certain issues related to workers' safety, health, and various environmental and other public health problems have also worsened owing to the rapid economic development.

We also find that CSP in the ""product"" dimension is positively associated with the extent and quality of SED whilst CSP in the ""people"" dimension is negatively associated with the extent and quality of SED.

This study seeks to propose that, by enhancing employee awareness of the organisation's CSR activities (aimed at society, the government, customers, and employees), organisational communication can increase affective commitment. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected at a Dutch healthcare insurance company, using a web-based questionnaire (n=301). The proposed model was tested with structural equation modelling (SEM) using Amos. Findings: The bootstrapping results showed a positive association between information flow and affective commitment, with a mediating effect for CSR aimed at employees and customers. CSR projects aimed at the government and society at large did not mediate the relationship between information flow and affective commitment. Originality/value: The impact of CSR towards employees and customers can be explained by social exchange theory. When employees feel that their organisation values their well-being and that of their customers, they reciprocate what they receive from the organisation by committing themselves to the organisation. As such, this study provides an important argument for the implementation of CSR activities: it increases the emotional attachment of employees towards their organisation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Affective commitment; Affective psychology; Corporate communications; Corporate social responsibility; Information flow; Organizational communication; Social responsibility",,"ter Hoeven, C.

Findings: In this research the critical success factors for CSR implementation are identified and presented. For gathering data and sampling, the banking sector of Iran was selected as the case study of this research. Based on the viewpoint of the experts of this research, 23 CSFs for CSR implementation were identified and then the importance of these CSFs was determined. This is an innovative study in the field of CSR in the banking sector that presents a new category for critical success factors for CSR implementation. All the identified CSFs are categorized into the five main sections of the organizational functional areas. These functional areas include financial, marketing, environmental, strategic and human resources. Originality/value: This study first provides a framework for CSR implementation in the banking sector. Also the main CSFs are identified and ranked. By means of the results of this study, decision makers in the field will be more familiar with CSR and can make higher decisions for the chief departments of the organization. Finally academicians in the field can use the framework of this research and develop CSR for other organizations and sectors of business. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banking sector; Corporate social responsibility; Critical success factors; Financial services",,"Kahreh, M.

By adopting an institutional approach and defining moral legitimacy as ""a positive normative evaluation of the organization and its activities"", the goal of this paper is to investigate which corporate communication strategy adopted in online social media is more effective to create convergence between corporations' corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda and stakeholders' social expectations, and thereby, to increase corporate legitimacy. Design/methodology/approach: Using the entire Twitter social graph, a network analysis was carried out to study the structural properties of the CSR community, such as the level of reciprocity, and advanced data mining techniques, i.e. topic and sentiment analysis, were carried out to investigate the communication dynamics. Findings: Evidence was found that neither the engaging nor the information strategies lead to alignment. The assumption of the more the dialog, the more the communality seems to fail to portray the complexity of the communicational dynamics, such as the persistence of different, or simply a dialog without alignment. Empirical findings show that, even when engaging in a dialogue, communication in social media is still conceived as a marketing practice to convey messages about companies.

We also find that organizational structure constrains the philanthropic influence of board members, but not of senior managers, a result contrary to what existing theory would predict.

Design/methodology/approach: First, conduct desktop research including but not limited to academic literature reviews on benchmarking, performance measurement and previous and current examples of online benchmarking tools in order to determine issues in the field; second, report the development process and functionalities of a benchmarking tool; third, examine the benchmarking tool through structured interviews with the users of the tool; and finally, draw conclusion as to whether the tool is effective or needs changes to make it more effective. Findings: Six Key Performance Indicators were identified: Transport cost, Transport time, Flexibility, Reliability, Quality, Sustainability. The functionality of an online transport chain benchmarking e-tool is detailed. The evaluation of the tool found that it is a strategic decision-making tool; cost is most often selected as the most important indicator; the majority would not use the tool for daily planning purposes. Future needs of development were identified, including using the tool for procurement decisions, and its utility in supporting corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The benchmarking e-tool is developed for the 27 EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland. Thus, the research findings are primarily applicable for these countries and may not be applicable for other countries. Practical implications: The online tool has been used by multiple commercial companies actively involved, as a service provider or user, in the freight transport chain to plan their transport chains. Social implications: The tool makes the strategic planning of intermodal and co-modal transport solutions easier and supports exploring sustainable freight transport choices in Europe.

Today the problem is viewed by many commentators as an ethical challenge to business itself. In response to this challenge, we begin by examining Porter and Kramer's (Harv Bus Rev 89(January-February):64-77, 2011) call for a shift from a social responsibility to a shared value framework and the need to respond to the problem of the 'separation thesis' between business and ethics (Wicks, Bus Soc 35(1):89-118, 1996; Harris and Freeman, Bus Ethics Q 18(4):541-548, 2008). We identify the eighteenth century economist and philosopher Adam Smith in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments as a source for an ethical approach to business. Building on his central concept of 'sympathy', we introduce the idea of the Impartial Spectator Test, which we argue builds on traditional stakeholder perspectives and which provides an objective route to ethical criteria of demarcation. We conclude by assessing how this approach adds to the existing debate around social responsibility and shared value. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adam Smith; Corporate social responsibility; Impartial Spectator Test; Separation thesis; Shared value",,"Szmigin, I.; Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, United Kingdom; email: i.t.szmigin@bham.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Corporations use transparency claims to cultivate the impression of full disclosure. The paper aims to explore why people believe transparency ensures responsible behavior from corporations as well as the negative effects of this pseudo-panopticon. Design/methodology/approach: The paper explores transparency in relation to CSR, CSR reporting, the internet, and activism and describes how their confluence produces pseudo-panopticon. Findings: The paper finds that the pseudo-panopticon allows corporations to claim transparency in CSR communication and for stakeholders to accept that claim. The reality is that a minority of activist stakeholders bear the burden of ensuring true transparency by questioning disclosure. Social implications: Transparency should be seen as a process, and it fails if activists cannot create public awareness of CSR shortcomings. The challenge is to find ways to make transparency as a process work in a world where apathy and self-deception, in part facilitated by the pseudo-panopticon, work against the process.

This approach has been criticized for neglecting the formative role of communication in the emergence of organizations. This paper seeks to propose to reconceptualize CSR communication by drawing on the ""communication constitutes organizations"" (CCO) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper that explores the implications of switching from an instrumental to a constitutive notion of communication. Findings: The study brings forth four main findings: from the CCO view, organizations are constituted by several, partly dissonant, and potentially contradictory communicative practices. From that viewpoint, the potential impact of CSR communication becomes a matter of connectivity of CSR to other practices of organizational communication. Communication practices that concern CSR should not be generally dismissed as mere ""greenwashing"" - given that some forms of talk can be action. Consequently, there is a need to investigate which specific speech acts create accountability and commitment in the context of CSR. The CCO view shows that CSR communication potentially extends the boundary of the organization through the involvement of third parties. Thus, it is fruitful to study CSR communication as a set of practices that aims at boundary maintenance and extension. Organizations are stabilized by various non-human entities that ""act"" on their behalf. Accordingly, CSR communication should also take into account non-human agency and responsibility. Originality/value: This paper links the literature on CSR communication to broader debates in organizational communication studies and, in particular, to the CCO perspective. By applying the CCO view, it reconceptualizes CSR communication as a complex process of meaning negotiation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication constitutes organizations; Corporate communications; Corporate social responsibility; CSR communication; Polyphony; Social responsibility",,"Schoeneborn, D.; Department of Business Administration, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; email: dennis.schoeneborn@uzh.ch",,,13563289,,,,"English","Corp.

To explain crosscountry variation in corporate commitment to social responsibility we investigate the political conditions that encourage firms to participate in the United Nations Global Compact. Drawing on a theory of corporate social responsibility as motivated by self-interest and external pressure, we examine the influence of external actors and the locally specific mobilization of bias. Analyzing participation levels in 145 countries, we find that a democratic regime and Global Compact participation by countervailing groups are associated with higher levels of business participation in the program.

One approach targets parents to influence their child's behavior. However, the extant literature remains unclear about whether childhood parenting strategies affect children's behavior beyond early adolescence. To fill this void, this research develops an integrative model of parental influence, specifying parenting strategies as antecedents, self-esteem as mediator, and susceptibility to negative peer influence (SPI) and substance use (smoking, and drinking) as socialization outcomes. The findings indicate that childhood parenting strategies impact smoking and drinking in the late teens, by reducing susceptibility to negative peer influence, with self-esteem playing a critical mediating role.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via a qualitative research design from four seniors' clubs in Australia using focus groups (12), and participant observation. The data were analyzed using QSR NVivo software using an interpretive approach. Findings: Ten themes based on 34 codes were identified in the study, which were grouped to develop a conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences of seniors' empowerment in third places for further testing. The themes under consumer empowerment were important in assisting to understand the significance of place and social engagement within the place to empower seniors with a positive self-image, better access to information and exercise of choices for smarter purchase decisions. The themes under social capital contributed to a better understanding of the ramification of social capital to marketing knowledge. This was particularly so for marketing constructs embedded in community or aggregate level issues such as value co-creation, relationship marketing, customer involvement and related outcomes. Finally the study reports three types of loyalty: cognitive, ultimate and communal loyalty, that underpinned the behavioral, attitudinal and cognitive dimension of loyalty. The findings suggested that consequent to seniors' social capital and feeling of empowerment in third places they display loyalty to the third place. Research limitations/implications: The present study has three theoretical implications; first, it extends knowledge into the notion of third place which underlies the broader domain of servicescape. It also extends understanding of the significance of third places in practicing consumer centric marketing through consumer empowerment. The study also contributes to understanding how third places enhance seniors' social capital through social engagement. Practical implications: The managerial implications suggested by the findings provide a number of aspects that managers may consider in relation to service places in three key broad categories of customer-firm interest: improve customer patronage through community engagement, improve local business practices via customer-owner friendship, and redesigning spatial settings to deliver meaningful customer experiences. Originality/value: This paper uses the concepts of social engagement within customer community in third places for the development of social capital and empowerment. It provides a customer centric focus to servicescape and incorporates recent works on third places, empowerment, social capital and loyalty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Customer loyalty; Empowerment; Loyalty; Older consumers; Seniors; Social capital; Third places",,"O'Cass, A.; School of Management, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia; email: ocass@utas.edu.au",,,08876045,,,,"English","J.

From the perspective of public agencies the relationship between expectations, experiences and satisfaction of infrastructure stakeholders affected by road maintenance is explored. Drawing upon data collected during a road maintenance project in the Netherlands it is shown that expectations only played a minor role in the formation of satisfaction. Moreover, depending on the contextual setting of the maintenance project, the importance of highway performance impacts for the formation of satisfaction through expectations and experiences changed. The results suggest that the value-in-use experience and the time dependence of expectations account for the switch in importance and the limited role of expectations.

However, the application of the process approach has been implemented in two different ways: (1) a declarative application and (2) a real application in enterprise management systems. The fulfilment of the ISO 9001 standard concerning the application of a process approach into practice is represented by a business process model. As the standard requests, it usually contains identified processes and activities, their interactions, the determination of responsibilities for processes, and the determination of sources and proper indicators for monitoring and improving company processes. The existence of a business process model does not guarantee its real application in enterprise management and may only satisfy a declarative fulfilment of the ISO 9001 standard requirements, which is often sufficient for external auditors. Based on the above mentioned different approaches to application, two research questions have been defined: (1) does the declarative application of the process approach prevail over its real application in enterprises with the ISO 9001 quality management certificate and (2) what is the selected management areas where enterprises certified to the ISO 9001 standard could apply their developed business process models?

This question is by no means new or surprising; but what is really puzzling is that dedicated research efforts have failed to provide consistent evidence on this issue. Therefore, the 'business case' for sustainability is controversial, despite the fact that companies are more and more under pressure to standardize and expand their voluntary ethical practices. The research design serves the purpose of answering some of these questions: 77 large industrial European companies were included in a highly-relevant new dataset, containing aggregated greenhouse gas emission figures, as well as universally-accepted financial performance indicators. On these balanced panel data we conducted several types of analyses, tailored to capture the sign and strength of the relationship between environmental and financial performance. We also introduced an innovative measure of responsible governance, as an interaction term between board-level innovations and the level of independent assurance. Our results are mixed, largely dependent on different model specifications and the several procedures to obtain robust standard errors. As expected, there is no definitive conclusion on the aforementioned relationship. Responsible governance seems to have an insignificant contribution to real sustainability performance, as well as to the economic welfare of the firm. Overall, we support the results to be found in the prior literature, in that CSR attributes - here including emission reduction efforts - will bear higher costs, but also higher revenues, resulting in a neutral relationship between CSR activity and firm financial performance. Owing to the uniqueness of the database in use and to the complexity of the econometric analysis, our findings are another proof of the controversy surrounding the relationship between firm financial and environmental performance.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental performance; European Union; Financial performance; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainability",,"Dragomir, V.

Hence, virtue ethicists ride happily to the rescue, offering to replace or complement Kant's theory with their own. Before such efforts are undertaken, however, one should recognize that Kant himself wrote a ""virtue theory"" (Tugendlehre), wherein he discussed the questions of character as well as the teleological nature of human action. Numerous Kant scholars argue that Kant already erected precisely the kind of integrative moral architecture that some of his modern interpreters (while aiming to supersede him) wish to construct. For business ethics, this divergence of scholarly opinion is of crucial importance. It shows first that the standard portrayals of Kant's ethics in business ethics textbooks-as rigidly deontological, narrowly individualistic, and hence unsuitable for the specific demands of corporate agency-might have to be revised. Second, discussions in the business ethics literature on stakeholder-engagement and managerial decision-making likewise stand to gain from a more nuanced picture of Kant's moral philosophy. Third, a reassessment of Kant's ethics with regard to questions of personal character and moral sentiments might also lead to a more favorable view of the relevance of his ethics for managerial practice. Last, but not least, the many current attempts to reconcile Kant's freedom-oriented philosophy with virtue theories stand to benefit considerably from a better understanding of how Kant himself conceived of one such synthesis between the formal and substantial aspects of morality. This, ultimately, could lead to an important overlapping consensus in the academic literature as to the role and relevance of virtuous conduct in business. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Deontology; Formalism; Kant; Kantian; Teleology; Virtue ethics",,"Dierksmeier, C.; Global Ethic Institute, University of Tübingen, Hintere Grabenstr. 26, 2070 Tübingen, Germany; email: clausdierksmeier@gmail.com",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

In the process, the relationships between executive compensation and financial performance, and corporate social performance and financial performance are examined to determine whether potential compensation and social performance links are coming at the expense of company financial performance. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical data for this research were obtained from a stratified sample of Fortune 1000 companies pulled from across more than 15 industries. Multiple regression analysis is utilized to test three hypotheses. Findings - In line with the hypotheses, results indicate that companies identified as good corporate social performers do in fact have lower levels of executive compensation and there is some support found for a positive relationship between social and financial performance. Practical implications - The results provide support for the view that firms concerned about social responsibility can put restrictions on executive compensation and still achieve good financial performance, and make a case that executive compensation should in fact be a concern of all socially responsible firms. Originality/value - There are few studies that examine the direct link between executive compensation and corporate social responsibility. This study addresses this gap in the literature and adds to the discussion as to whether socially responsible firms might seek to better balance compensation across the firm and emphasize that profit, both individual and corporate, must be earned within a system that is fair and balanced for all. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Compensation; Competitive strategy; Empirical research; Service strategy; Servicescape; Social responsibility",,"Miles, P.C.; Department of Management, University of Maine, Orono, ME, United States; email: patti.miles@maine.edu",,,17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

The aim is to determine which stakeholders are viewed as key motivators and which the respondents think ought to be key stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - This is an empirical study. Three stakeholder groups - corporate leaders, MSc business students and NGOs - were consulted through a paper survey (n = 264). Findings - The findings reveal that the three stakeholder groups roughly agree that owners are the main motivators for managers to pursue CSR, followed by customers, governments, employees and NGOs, in that order. The paper then turned from perceptions of how things are to opinions about how things ought to be, asking who should be the main motivator. In this case, customers moved up to first place, followed by employees, owners, government and NGOs. Age, but not gender, was a significant variable. The older the respondents, the smaller the discrepancy between perceptions of what is and opinions about what ought to be. Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted in Norway and generalization is therefore limited. By replicating the study in other countries cultural differences can be investigated. Practical implications - The findings are applicable for evaluating different avenues for understanding and influencing managerial and stakeholder CSR behaviour. Originality/value - Several studies have concluded that stakeholders are of key importance in the CSR setting. However, few studies so far have compared the perceived relative 'power' held by stakeholders. This type of knowledge can provide a key to understanding the development of CSR. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Customers; Employees; Government; Management; Motivation; Non-governmental organizations; Norway; Owners; Social responsibility; Stakeholders",,"Ditlev-Simonsen, C.D.; Centre for Corporate Responsibility, BI - Norwegian Business School, Department of Accounting, Auditing and Law, Oslo, Norway; email: caroline.d.ditlev-simonsen@bi.no",,,17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with executives of 14 companies, and open-ended questionnaires filled out by three organizations, all of which the public perceives as highly socially responsible. Additional data were collected from two CSR seminars, official company web sites, and a database provided by the Stock Exchange of Thailand's library. Findings - The study reveals two key findings. One is the pattern of CSR development in Thailand that emphasizes social and environmental issues, which are less relevant to the business' core activities. The other is that Thai social and religious values are important antecedents of CSR strategy and implementation. Corporations communicate CSR implicitly and execute a two-stage public relations strategy indirectly. Originality/value - This paper reveals a unique interpretation of CSR in developing economies where agrarian social values and informal networks still dominate. Most extant literature assumes that CSR in developing countries mimics western patterns.

A total of 22 definitions for GSCM and 12 definitions for SSCM were identified. In order to analyze the identified definitions, two different sets of key characteristics for business sustainability (i.e., economic, environmental, social, stakeholder, volunteer, resilience, and long-term focuses) and SCM (i.e., flow, coordination, stakeholder, relationship, value, efficiency, and performance focuses) were proposed. The identified definitions were analyzed against each other and the two sets of proposed key characteristics. The analysis shows that definitions for GSCM were generally more narrowly focused than those for SSCM and had an emphasis on the characteristics of environmental, flow, and coordination focuses. Though some definitions of SSCM show considerable overlap with definitions of GSCM, it is argued that SSCM is essentially an extension of GSCM. Several identified definitions addressed at least half of the proposed key business sustainability and SCM characteristics. However, no complete definition of GSCM or SSCM was identified. To address this issue, a new definition for SSCM is proposed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that even though stakeholder orientation offers a broader inclusion of values and expectations than market orientation, they share considerable similarities in terms of sustainability assumptions and how the role of the corporation becomes perceived in the quest for sustainable development. Both strategies leave responsibility outside the firm by emphasising the role of either customers or stakeholders as the basis of strategizing. Both strategies are also based on assumptions consistent with weak sustainability (at best), which is argued to be insufficient in order to achieve sustainability over time and space. Therefore, this article suggests that a new orientation is needed if corporations are to contribute to sustainable development, namely sustainable development orientation. We call for further research in outlining a business strategy that admits corporations' responsibility for sustainable development and departs from the strong sustainability assumption. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Such growth has stimulated financing of developments and improvements in cleaner production methods, consumption patterns of responsible corporations and, in general, changed behaviour towards corporate sustainability. However, cleaner production investments vary across different regions in the world for several reasons such as: capital availability, the stage of development of banking systems, the existence of appropriate finance mechanisms, available corporate know-how and technology risks. This research aimed to provide relevant information about the outcomes of integrating environmental, social and governance issues for cleaner production into investment strategies in the Asia Pacific region for managers, practitioners, academics, institutions and investors. Research focused on analysing the performance of the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific index (DJSI-AP) because the index applies a 'Best in Class' investment screening method, being more relevant to fostering cleaner production. Results indicate that the social and environmental screening process neither represents a burden of cost generation for companies, nor an additional burden on their SRI financial performance.

Corporations everywhere try to respond to new environmental challenges by actively engaging in the life of the community and by developing relationships based on mutual trust with consumers. This article introduces the corporate social responsibility domain by underlining the importance of this concept to the later development of a company. The article denounces the results of research conducted on Romanian consumers regarding corporate social responsibility campaigns undergone by firms in Romania. Its purpose is to bring insight into Romanian consumers' perceptions of recent social campaigns, reviewing the extent to which these consumers are willing to become involved in society's well-being. The survey conducted here attempts to provide answers to issues that concern the companies' involvement type, their purview, the reasons for participating in society's welfare, as well as the social campaigns' most common action areas. The results gathered show that corporate social responsibility is not only a promotion method, but a method that implies the effective involvement in the life of the community and in its subsequent issues, therefore representing a real means of support for the economic development of the community in question.

The new framework is found from the incomplete link between managerial motivation and their actual involvement with CSR activities. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses annual reports of 16 Islamic banks from three regions. Using content analysis method, the study produces an ethical identity index on eight dimensions. The average index scores are ranked to get a view of the importance given by Islamic banks to the path of social responsibility. Findings: In this study, the customer-centric CSR framework assumes that there are two layers of CSR involvement in Islamic banks. The upper layer assures the commitment towards Allah (SWT) by operating under Islamic Shari'ah. The bottom layer ensures the commitment towards customers, employees and society. The reports of Islamic banks show that the selected banks are too customer centric and efficiency driven. However, that efficiency is targeted at the cost of sacrificing Shari'ah norms. Their commitments to basic Islamic rules fall far behind the average. Research limitations/implications: The study uses content analysis of the annual report to identify CSR involvement of the Islamic banks. There are various issues related to CSR and corporate management that are not reported in annual reports. Moreover, disclosure norms and regulation also have an influence on reporting standards. Thus, this study is limited to what is found in the reports only. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing literature on customer-centric CSR and customer-centric marketing. There is evidence that the findings from this study are consistent with other studies. Islamic banks are becoming customer centric because of the competition from conventional banks. However, they must not forget the very essence of the establishment of these banks which is the spiritual freedom based upon sole submission to Allah (SWT). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bahrain; Bangladesh; Banks; Corporate social responsibility; Customer-centric CSR; Efficient ethics; Ethical Identity; Ethics; Islam; Islamic banks; Kuwait; Malaysia; Saudi Arabia; United Arab Emirates",,"Rashid, M.; Graduate School of Business, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia; email: mamun.finance@gmail.com",,,20408269,,,,"English","Manage.

We believe that 'Smoke and Mirrors' (hereafter S&M) identifies an area of considerable importance but that it is misleading and problematic for several reasons. First, it glosses over the important distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Despite using the term 'tax avoidance' in the title, to establish its conclusion, the paper relies predominantly on a handful of examples involving fraud, deceit and corruption, which are behaviors usually associated with 'tax evasion'. In the context of corporate social responsibility, we explain why this distinction is crucial and offer directions for future research in this area. Second, Sikka's paper ignores voluminous extant research on tax compliance, corporate tax avoidance and its relationship with CSR. Third, the paper mis-reports key statistics on the tax gap in the UK and US, and finally, it omits a robust discussion of the considerable policy response to corporate tax avoidance, which has been promoted by numerous tax agencies and international organizations such as the OECD.

In Asia, CSR is increasingly attracting attention but the legal system generally is perceived as being poor. We hypothesize that there is an inverse relationship between CSR and earnings management, as well as between investor protection and earnings management. Regarding earnings management, we investigate earnings smoothing and earnings aggressiveness. We find that Asian firms with relatively good CSR are engaged significantly less with earnings management. Investor protection also is negatively associated with earnings management. We find that this is very case sensitive and depends on the ways in which earnings management and investor protection are actually measured.

The sample organizations practiced CSR mainly through informal, internally oriented and relational methods with very little, if any, managerial and strategic approach. A large number of sample organizations viewed employees as the most important stakeholders for CSR communication whereas customers, suppliers, and business partners trailed far behind.

This study addresses this deficit. Building on advances in the application of psychological theories to the field of management, the research develops and empirically tests a theoretical model of how CR-related experiences and beliefs drive stakeholder trust and positive intent.

The predominant response of researchers and policymakers has been to focus on the external impact of business operations and the merits of regulation or persuasion in achieving more responsible practice in these areas. In this article, we focus on a less well explored aspect of CSR, namely the evaluation of an organization's CSR activities by its internal stakeholders (i.e., employees). Salient CSR literature is reviewed to differentiate between CSR and ethical business practice (EBP), conceptualizing the latter as the internal manifestation of CSR as represented by an organization's values and vision, strategy and policy, systems and procedures, and people management practices. This article assesses organizational espousal of EBP in three ways: how successfully it is communicated to employees, how closely espousal aligns with employee expectation, and how this evaluation impacts on employee commitment. Our research approach aligns with and extends previous work in this area that identifies the likelihood of a ""false consensus bias"" by managers in assuming congruence between organization espousal of EBP and employee expectation. A conceptual model is offered to explain possible employee responses to an organization's EBP. This relates organization espousal of EBP to employee assessment of its salience to identify three positions on commitment that employees can adopt-abrogated, continuance, and affective commitment-together with their likely behavioral implications. The analysis generates a series of research questions and related areas of exploration to empirically test the conceptual model. © 2013 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,,"Mason, C.; Marketing and Operations Management, Faculty of Business and Enterprise, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; email: christophermason@swin.edu.au",,,00453609,,,,"English","Bus.

Such logos tend to be based on rigorous paradigmatic codes of conduct in that field. The procedure that we comment upon constitutes a suggestive manifestation in the realm of corporate social responsibility. The effects of such a decision are visible in a number of scenarios. In effect, among other aspects, they have repercussions on visits by potential customers to compliant websites, the capture of real customers, volume of sales, image of corporate character and the quality-price relationship of the product and/or services offered.","B2C e-commerce; Codes of conduct; Consumers; Corporate social responsibility; Trust mark",,"ALópez Jiménez, D.; Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Campus Providen-cia, Pedro de Valdivia núm, 641, Santiago de Chile, Chile; email: amonroy111@hotmail.com",,,01215051,,,,"English; Spanish","Innovar",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877682251

Design/methodology/approach: To explain the (on-going) change-management process, the authors retrospectively applied change-management literature to the implicit process in which they have, themselves, been intimately involved. Findings: The implicit change-management process had unconsciously mobilized a variety of tactics identified in the change-management literature; a more explicit articulation of the ""as-is"" and ""desired"" states, and a more explicit, systematic and regular communication of the journey and goal, might have enabled faster progress. However, the nature of a highly autonomous and decentralized organization, such as an academic institution, means that sustainable change management may be slower than in commercial institutions.

In order to develop suitable marketing and communication strategies, it is essential to have a realistic picture of consumer priorities, and in the light of these findings, of the viability of classical academic marketing approaches, such as Kotler's societal marketing concept. This study provides a qualitative evaluation of the contradictory research literature on consumer interest in SRP and an assessment of the usability of classical marketing approaches. It contributes essential insights to the ongoing academic debate about a conceptualisation of SRP marketing approaches. Also, it will allow practitioners more ease of access to this debate. Findings show that a majority of consumers prioritise conventional product features and demonstrate low interest in SRP. Consumer research which states otherwise is revealed as methodologically flawed. Most classical marketing approaches are shown to be unsuitable for SRP marketing and communication since they fail to take into account the widespread lack of consumer interest and/or focus on consumer features irrelevant to marketing SRP. Directions for future research on SRP marketing and communication strategies are outlined. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","communication strategies; consumer research; corporate social responsibility; ethical consumption; marketing strategies",,"Davis, I.; MVG Medienproduktion, Marketing, Postfach 10 15 45, 52064, Aachen, Germany; email: davis@eine-welt-mvg.de",,,13527266,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative research where content analysis is used to analyse leading property companies' websites, annual reports, corporate responsibility and sustainability reports, and carbon disclosure reports. Findings: Findings from this research indicate that the majority of the developers have their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in place and there are variations in their approaches and reporting process. Of all, philanthropic activities are the mostly widely reported followed by human resource initiatives. Even though the majority of property companies reported their environmental practices, only the top few developers had their projects certified by sustainability rating agencies. Research limitations/implications: As this project was restricted to the top ten Malaysian developers, the results do not reflect how other companies, particularly the smaller ones, adopt CSR in their business. However, this project revealed valuable findings regarding the magnitude of CSR initiatives, particularly on social and environmental perspective, adopted by the top ten Malaysian property developers; this is useful for the Malaysian government authorities in formulating CSR-related policies particularly on environmental sustainability. As well, the findings of this project can be a useful reference to other property companies which are keen to contribute to sustainable development, particularly on social and environmental perspectives. Originality/value: There has been limited literature on CSR in the Malaysian property industry thus far. Previous research papers are mainly about environmental sustainability of property companies, sustainable practice by Malaysian real estate investment trusts, and CSR perception of house buyers and developers.

Design/methodology/approach: The effects of corporate associations on consumers' loyalty were tested through a structural equation model for a sample of 781 financial services users. Findings: The results confirm the value of commercial expertise (CE) as one of the most important determinants of both consumer satisfaction and identification with their financial services provider. Besides, corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributes to building consumer identification with the company, which is positively correlated to satisfaction too. Satisfaction is thus presented as both an affective and cognitive consumer response in the financial industry, which, along with identification, finally determines the attitudinal loyalty a consumer shows towards their provider. Originality/value: With this study, the authors try to contribute to a better knowledge of the consumer loyalty formation process as it begins with the perception of corporate associations for its commercial expertise and its social commitment. The researchers take into account the role of two variables - i.e. identification and satisfaction with the company - that had not been studied in depth in research analyzing the role of corporate associations in consumer loyalty. Moreover, CSR associations are also studied from a multidimensional point of view, as suggested in recent studies and in comparison to the vast majority of previous research, which has concentrated on specific and narrow dimensions of the concept, especially the social dimension. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Commercial expertise; Consumer behaviour; Consumer-company identification; Corporate associations; Corporate social responsibility; Loyalty; Satisfaction",,"Pérez, A.; Área de Comercialización e Investigación de Mercados, Departamento de Administración de Empresas, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain; email: perezran@unican.es",,,03090566,,,,"English","Eur.

Many destinations have attempted to move toward sustainability, but unfortunately, have been hindered in their attempts by a lack of collaboration among stakeholders that is necessary to support their sustainability agendas. Collaboration, specifically through multi-stakeholder partnerships, has been seen as an effective way to support initiatives in tourism development. Through the lens of Gray's collaboration theory and Selin and Chavez's tourism partnership model, the success of collaboration and partnerships in tourism development on the island of Gili Trawangan, Indonesia, will be examined.

But organizational downsizing not only cannot surely improves firm performance, but also harms thousands of employees and their families. A number of scholars investigating organizational change suggest that 'a responsible downsizing strategy' can mitigate or solve this issue. As the major stakeholder in downsizing, labor unions naturally negotiate with firms to protect employee rights and benefits. Their negotiation, therefore, may either enhance or mitigate the effect of responsible downsizing strategy on firm performance. This study used a sample of 154 downsized local firms and multinational corporations in Taiwan to examine the research construct, and invited focus groups to have a further validated explanation. The findings show that labor union negotiation may act as either stepping stones or stumbling blocks. The results indicate that firms employing labor union negotiation experience higher downsizing performance than non-unionized firms do. However, labor union interventions can also become stumbling blocks. Labor union negotiation neutralize the positive effect of employee-caring practices on downsizing performance, leading to a decline in downsizing performance when firms increase employee participation and justice consideration in the downsizing process. The research findings provide implications for further scholarly research and management practices in terms of organization change, stakeholder management and labor-management relationship. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","firm performance; labor union negotiation; multinational corporation; responsible downsizing strategy; stakeholder influence strategy",,"Shih, C.-T.; Department of Business Administration, National Pingtung Institute of Commerce, Pingtung, Taiwan; email: sctings@npic.edu.tw",,,09585192,,,,"English","Int.

This consideration implies that it becomes more and more important/urgent to measure and report intellectual capital. The new reporting statement (intellectual capital report) is not yet commonly used by firms, but many, on a voluntary basis, already publish environmental, social and sustainability reports, which contain much information on intangibles. Starting from this point, the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to integrate the information contained in both reports in a single ad hoc integrated document, having both external and internal communication aims. Design/methodology/approach: The paper addresses three research questions: whether the theoretical premises exist for the integration of the two different frameworks; which frameworks should be chosen as a starting point; and which features should have an integrated framework. Theoretical premises for integration have been found in the research-based view (RBV) theory. To chose the social report and intellectual capital report (ICR) framework to use as starting points, the authors analyze the frameworks from the intellectual capital (IC) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature; then choose the frameworks (GRI3 and Meritum reports) founded on an evolved notion of, respectively, corporate responsibility and IC, which share the same features - the orientation towards stakeholders, the managerial approach, and the focus on intangible activities that a new integrated framework should respect. Findings: Starting from the selected CSR and ICR frameworks, the authors planned and designed a new, ad hoc model of corporate communication, able to integrate the social and intangible dimensions in a single document, named the Intangible Global Report (IGR). The IGR framework is composed of five dimensions, three derived from the ICR (human capital, structural capital, relational capital) and two from the GRI report (environmental, social). The different aspects of each dimension are surveyed in terms of intangible resources, activities and impacts, measured by financial and non-financial indicators. Originality/value: The main originality of the paper consists in providing a general framework for firms to integrate all their intangible information in a single document - the IGR framework - focused on the firm's strategy, which allows the stakeholder to visualize all the firm's intangibles, how a company conducts its activities and the impacts that such activities have on the environmental, social and IC dimensions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Corporate social responsibility; Framework; Indicators; Intangibles; Integration; Intellectual capital",,"Veltri, S.; Department of Business Administration, University of Calabria, Calabria, Italy; email: stefania.veltri@unical.it",,,13563289,,,,"English","Corp.

Design/methodology/approach: For Study 1, a content analysis examined the types of information on for-profit organizations' Facebook pages. Facebook pages were coded for organizational disclosure and information dissemination, corporate social responsibility information, and interactivity. Pages were also coded for using a corporate ability, corporate social responsibility, or hybrid communication strategy. Three organizations were then selected based on the content analysis results to serve as exemplars in the two-phase experiment. Participants filled out measures of initial attitudes, perceptions of the organization-public relationship, corporate social responsibility, and purchase intent. A week later, participants interacted with the organizations' Facebook pages and then answered additional scale measures. Findings: Study 1 found for-profit organizations discuss program/services, achievements, and awards on their Facebook pages. The main communication strategy employed on Facebook is corporate ability. Study 2 results indicate interacting with Facebook pages bolsters stakeholders' perceptions of the organization-public relationship, corporate social responsibility, and purchase intent. The organization employing a corporate social responsibility communication strategy had the most success bolstering these variables. Research limitations/implications: Several of the organizations did not have Facebook pages to code for the content analysis. Some organizations' pages were not coded because the page was just starting and there was no information available. The content analysis included a small sample size (n=114) which impacted the experiment. It limited the number of organizations that could be employed in the experimental conditions. Practical implications: When posting information on Facebook, organizations should employ the corporate social responsibility communication strategy. However, regardless of the strategy employed, interacting with Facebook information can bolster stakeholders' perceptions of organizational-public relationships, corporate social responsibility, attitudes, and purchase intent. Originality/value: The paper adds to the experimental literature. There is very limited experimental research examining the impact of Facebook on stakeholders.

The outcomes of this debate affect organizations. The study is based on the seven types of framing identified by Hallahan and scrutinizes which of these types is utilized, and how this is done, in the case of human rights issues. Design/methodology/approach: For this study a secondary analysis of academic papers on human rights issues was conducted. After a literature search, 40 papers originating from 23 different journals were further analyzed. Where the researchers described the framing of human rights issues, the type of framing was identified according to the typology and mode of utilization. Findings: In the case of human rights, all seven framing types were found; however, the most common were the framing of attributes in which the economic or cultural context was emphasized and the framing of situations pointing out power differences between the actors. Research limitations/implications: The study underlines the complexity of framing and the importance of awareness of framing processes. It shows that the framing typology provides valuable insights into the debate on social issues, inspiring further research. Practical implications: This study provides a better understanding of the processes of issue framing, an important part of corporate communication strategies.

However, prior work in the area has paid little attention to how CSR initiatives should be implemented inside the organization. Against this backdrop, this study examines the impact of CSR initiatives on an important stakeholder group-employees. We build and test a comprehensive multilevel framework that focuses on whether employees derive job satisfaction from CSR programs. The proposed model predicts that a manager's charismatic leadership influences employees' interpretations about the motives underlying their companies' engagement in CSR initiatives (intrinsic and extrinsic CSR-induced attributions) which, in turn, influence employee job satisfaction. Hierarchical linear modeling of data from 47 organizational units comprising 438 employees from three world-leading manufacturing organizations shows that when employees think that their manager possesses charismatic leadership qualities, they tend to attribute the organization's motives for engaging in CSR activities to intrinsic values, which, in turn, are positively associated with job satisfaction. Also, the extent to which managers are perceived as charismatic leaders relates positively to job satisfaction. Interestingly, CSR-induced extrinsic attributions are neither explained by charismatic leadership nor do they predict job satisfaction. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Attribution theory; Charismatic leadership; Corporate social responsibility; Employees; Motives",,"Rapp, A.

In particular, little is known about how corporate decision-makers privately reconcile the conflicts between public and private interests, even though this is likely to be relevant to understanding the limitations of CSR as a means of aligning business activity with the broader public interest. This study addresses this issue using internal tobacco industry documents to explore British-American Tobacco's (BAT) thinking on CSR and its effects on the company's CSR Programme. The article presents a three-stage model of CSR development, based on Sykes and Matza's theory of techniques of neutralization, which links together: how BAT managers made sense of the company's declining political authority in the mid-1990s; how they subsequently justified the use of CSR as a tool of stakeholder management aimed at diffusing the political impact of public health advocates by breaking up political constituencies working towards evidence-based tobacco regulation; and how CSR works ideologically to shape stakeholders' perceptions of the relative merits of competing approaches to tobacco control. Our analysis has three implications for research and practice. First, it underlines the importance of approaching corporate managers' public comments on CSR critically and situating them in their economic, political and historical contexts. Second, it illustrates the importance of focusing on the political aims and effects of CSR. Third, by showing how CSR practices are used to stymie evidence-based government regulation, the article underlines the importance of highlighting and developing matrices to assess the negative social impacts of CSR. © 2012 The Author(s).","Corporate political activity; Corporate social responsibility; Political CSR; Stakeholder management; Techniques of neutralization",,"Fooks, G.; Department of Health, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, United Kingdom; email: g.fooks@bath.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Methodology/approach -Subsequent to a review of relevant literature, three case examples from McDonald's, Nestle, and Stora Enso illustrate Hockerts and Moir's grounded theory framework that suggest how IROs can improve communication of CSP. Findings -This chapter illustrates three levels of communicating CSP information. First, IROs target SRI investors and respond to ESG inquiries and surveys. At the second level, IROs integrate ESG information into business strategy and finacial results. At the third level, IROs actively market CSP and create a two-way proactive dialogue between SRI investors and senior management and the board.

CSR has been measured based on the impact that an organization makes in four areas of concern relevant to a country's national goal of human development.

Design/methodology/ approach-The study adopts a multi-perspective approach, referring to different theoretical frameworks on CSD, such as the legitimacy theory, the stakeholder theory, the agency model, the asymmetric information theory, and the institutional perspective. The empirical research is based on the sustainability reports of 80 companies in which investments were made by European socially responsible funds (SRFs) listed on the Morningstar platform during the years 2009-2008. The theoretical hypotheses are tested by a univariate and multivariate analysis. Findings-The breadth of the CSD depends on multiple factors, both external and internal, such as the country of origin, the industry reputation, the firm size, the frequency of the SRFs participation, the corporate social performance. Research limitations/implications-Limits inherent in this type of research are the comparability of the CSR reports and the systematization of the categories of content to be analyzed. Practical implications-The chapter identifies several factors that lead to a greater completeness of the CSD, exploiting the capacity of the social reporting to trigger benefits for the firms such as a stronger social legitimacy and the reduction of asymmetric information. Social implications-The research supports the investigation of the levers of CSD to meet the demand for a broader accountability. Originality/value-The reference to firms in which SRFs participated allows to focus on companies ascertained as socially responsible in accordance with a ""certification function"" of these funds. Findings support an approach which is not one-sided, thus enabling to look at the determinants of the CSD through different theoretical perspectives.

Design/methodology/approach: The history-of-management-thought approach to social responsibility (SR) is grounded in the paradigm of continuing progress exemplified by the contributions of great management thinkers (e.g. Fayol, Taylor, Follett, Barnard). A historical evolution of the SR concept is provided, together with tracing the development of stakeholder theory in its attempt to depict the relationship between stakeholder management and SR. Findings: Three management philosophies (recognition of the external environment, a need for collaboration, and a need for a shared understanding) emerge from both classical and modern management thinkers. Recent conceptualizations have added depth by clarifying the meaning of social responsibility and in addition, detailing the nature of firm-stakeholder relationships. Despite voluminous literature, achieving collaborative integration between firms and stakeholders in practice appears elusive. Practical implications: These management philosophies can help organizations navigate the intertwined relationship between business and society. Business leaders need to consider the vital role of trust in building more collaborative relationships. Originality/value: The unique contribution of this paper is to provide the first history-of-management-thought perspective on the social responsibility of business by tracing changes in the conceptualization of this concept, including the related stakeholder paradigm, to their roots in the works of renowned management thinkers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Management history; Stakeholder theory",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17511348,,,,"English","J.

The relational dominant logic of cause-related marketing focuses on building relationships with the target stakeholders through the enhancement of a firm's legitimacy. The combination of these two types of logic gives rise to four types of cause-related marketing: altruistic, commercial, social and integrative.

This study focused on the corporate social responsibility activities of these companies with respect to the governance structure put in place and the funds allocated for such activities. The study found that the Ghana Chamber of Mines in reporting the expenditure its members made on corporate social responsibility activities added cost elements which do not qualify to be referred to as corporate social responsibility. The funds set aside for social corporate responsibility were very small and could not bring about a meaningful change in the communities. Also, the companies operated various governance modules with different levels of community participation. The study recommends among others that the Ghana Chamber of Mines establishes a CSR Index to encourage its members to do more in that area. There is also the need for more transparency in the accounting of CSR expenditures.

This study departs from previous studies by including a fourth possible corporate response, engaging in dialogue. Dialogue, an alternative to shareholder resolutions filed by activists, is a process in which corporations and activist shareholder groups mutually agree to engage in ongoing negotiations to deal with social issues. Based on a unique dataset of resolutions filed by member organizations of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility from 2002 to 2005 and the outcomes of these resolutions, our analysis finds that corporate managers are more likely to engage in dialogue with shareholder activists when the firm is larger, is more responsive to stakeholders, the CEO is the board chair, and the firm has a relatively lower percentage of institutional investors. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Dialogue; Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility; Shareholder activism; Shareholder resolutions; Social activism",,"Logsdon, J.

However, while existing literature emphasises the importance for MNEs to collaborate with various stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research on the scope, peculiarities, and impact of such cooperation has been limited, particularly in those countries in Central Africa with a fragile state and weak governance structure. Furthermore, until recently, MNEs and NGOs in conflict countries had antagonistic relationships, which have created impediments for positive engagement. This paper examines MNEs and conflict issues, including interactions with NGOs, and sheds light on possible MNE contributions to peaceful societies by highlighting a few innovative partnerships of MNEs and non-business partners in Central Africa. Innovative partnerships take the conflict context into account, have a learning or capacity-building component, are part of a more comprehensive development plan yet are embedded at the community level, and tackle issues directly related to the conflict, such as governance, human rights, artisanal mining, and transparency.

It aims at analyzing the relationship between the reasons why firms adopt CSR and the importance given to voluntary CSR disclosure. Methodology-Two main categories of CSR determinants have been identified: the external ones, coming from the environment outside the firm, and the internal determinants, which are linked to some specific characteristics of the enterprise and to the objectives it pursues. The analyzed sample consists of 120 large Italian manufacturing and non manufacturing enterprises. The research hypotheses concerning the relationship between external and internal determinants of CSR and CSR disclosure were verified using an independent sample t-test, evaluating the equal variances of clusters using the Levene's test. Findings-Main results point out that in companies giving importance to CSR disclosure, the internal drivers are more relevant than the external ones in determining the attitude toward CSR. Among the internal determinants, drivers related to company and management values and ethics are quite relevant. Research limitations-This study is subject to the limitations that generally apply to cross-sectional survey-based research. Originality/Value of chapter-Our research findings show that legitimacy theory represents the most relevant theory in explaining CSR disclosure practices of Italian large firms, as well as the operational implementation of stakeholder theory, such as stakeholder management. On the contrary, institutional theory only partially explains CSR disclosure, with respect to the pressures coming from financial markets.

Young American participants evaluated the CSR practices of multinational corporations more favorably than did the young Korean participants. In addition, four CSR practices (internal environment, moral, discretionary, and relational) were associated with OPR dimensions in the United States, while only relational CSR practices were significantly related to OPR dimensions in South Korea. Overall, the findings highlight that cultural and societal meanings were embedded in identifying CSR practices and evaluating the relationship with multinational corporations involved in CSR practices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Multinational corporations; Organization-public relationships",,"Kim, D.; Department of Public Relations, College of Mass Communications, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, 79409, United States; email: simon.kim@ttu.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Consequently, firms have financial incentives to be tax aggressive. However, tax aggressive behaviour may adversely impact a firm's reputation, an invaluable asset. Furthermore, paying one's fair share of taxes is an important component of corporate social responsibility. Hence, socially responsible firms that are concerned about preserving their good reputation should be less tax aggressive. This study investigates whether socially responsible firms are less tax aggressive, that is, whether their talk as defined by 'corporate social behaviours' and their actions as defined by 'paying their fair share of taxes' are aligned, and whether this relationship differs between family and non-family firms. Based on archival data for 2004-2008 on a panel of Canadian firms, the results indicate that family firms are less tax aggressive than non-family firms. In addition, the findings suggest that tax behaviours are not necessarily aligned with corporate social responsibility, and that the ownership structure moderates this relationship. The findings also underscore the importance of considering corporate social responsibility dimensions separately when investigating the relationship between tax aggressiveness and corporate social responsibility.","Corporate social responsibility; Family and non-family firms; Reputation; Tax aggressiveness",,,,"Dumont Institute for Public Policy Research",1089652X,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: A unique sample of 20 Australian corporations accused by the Australian Taxation Office of engaging in tax aggressive activities during the 2001-2006 period was hand-collected. These 20 tax aggressive corporations were then matched with 20 non-tax aggressive corporations (based on industry classification, corporation size and time period). This process generated a choice-based sample of 40 corporations for empirical analysis. Using content analysis techniques, financial accounting data were gathered from the Aspect-Huntley database and CSR disclosures were individually measured for each corporation in the sample. Various statistical techniques were then used (e.g. paired sample statistics, Pearson correlation analysis and ordinary least squares regression analysis) to test legitimacy theory. Findings: Overall, the empirical results consistently show a positive and statistically significant association between corporate tax aggressiveness and CSR disclosure, thereby confirming legitimacy theory in the context of corporate tax aggressiveness. Originality/value: The paper provides empirical evidence in support of legitimacy theory as an explanation for why specific corporations disclose more CSR-related information than others.

This paper provides the Islamic perspective of CSR, which is etho-religious based and, thus, more meaningful and intensified. It proposes a CSR framework for IBFIs based on principles of Islamic economics and society. The proposed framework urges IBFIs to engage in communitybased banking, work toward the betterment of the poor, ensure the most efficient and socially desirable utilization of financial resources, develop their institutional frameworks, infrastructures, and innovative products to facilitate the wider circulation of wealth and sustainable development in the world.

The article examines the circumstances of the crash to assess the effectiveness of an instrumental, business case for safety and, by extension, for corporate social responsibility (CSR). The article fills a gap in the business and the management literature by adopting a qualitative, case study methodology to complement earlier, predominantly quantitative research. The study analyzes a comprehensive set of documentary data available from the offshore regulator's public inquiry website, including many days of verbatim testimony from the industry, the union, regulators, investigators, the lone survivor and families of the deceased, in addition to written submissions and expert reports. Investigatory reports from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the NL Inquiry were analyzed, as were regulatory documents and media coverage. Although offshore safety has improved since the Ocean Ranger disaster in 1982 (Wells http://www.cnlopb.nl.ca/ohsi_phase_one.shtml, 2010), the empirical evidence in this case study adds to our understanding of how reliance on a voluntary, instrumental business case for CSR in the absence of a normative concept of CSR is likely to fail, largely because of the existence of a powerful tension between oil exploration and production and investment in safety. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business case for safety; Corporate social responsibility; Helicopter safety; Offshore oil safety",,"Hart, S.

Preston (1999) traces the notion of stakeholders back to the great depression in the United States (1929-1941), when the General Electric company defined four major stakeholder groups -shareholders, employees, customers, and the general public. Stakeholder management has become an important tool to transfer ethics to management practice and strategy. Few management topics have generated more debate in recent decades than the underlying notion, the model and the theories surrounding stakeholders (Donaldson and Preston, 1995; Gibson, 2000; Wolfe and Putler, 2002; Friedman and Miles, 2006). The visual power of the stakeholder model and its high simplicity are seen as contributors to the success of the stakeholder concept (Fassin, 2008). An increasing interrelation is observed between the concepts of stakeholder theory, corporate responsibility, and business ethics (Valor, 2005; Garriga et al., 2004). The stakeholder approach in the organization integrates stakeholder relationships within a company’s resource base, industry setting, and socio-political arena into a single analytical framework (Susniene & Sargunas, 2009).Mumford (1979) is one of the early researchers in supporting the involvement of end-users as a component of effective in-formation systems development and implementation, using essentially the stakeholder concept in this domain. It has been proved that end-users and managers are very important towards successful system implementation. As more interorganizational information systems are developed which usually involve strategic decisions, a yet wider range of stakeholders needs to be involved (Pouloudi, 1999). In these systems the attention may switch from end-users and focus on those parties that are external to the organization, but who can also be associated in decision making at a managerial or strategic level (Pouloudi & Whitely, 1997). One of the most thorough investigations of the stakeholder concept in information systems research that relates information systems stakeholders with implementation failure was made as an early work by Lyytinen and Hirschheim (1987, 1988). They argue that failure is conditional on the capability of information system to meet the expectations of different stakeholders -i.e. to say an information system may be considered successful by some stakeholder but a failure by others. The concept of stakeholder represents a progression from developer – and user – centered problems to organization-wide and inter organizational information system problems. This is a sign of maturity of information systems research to show how holistic representation of the parties involved in the more complex systems currently developed (Pouloudi, 1999). Stakeholder theory proposes an ethical use of stakeholder concept in Information systems as ethical considerations and professional conduct is a significant issue in information system.The stakeholder theory is extensively used in management in investigating organizational ambiance, strategic management, ethical concerns, business planning process, e-government, project management, environment management, etc. Recently stakeholders are also seen as means to more successful information and communication technologies and information system development and implementation issues. The paper presents stakeholder theory, its origin and applications in Information Systems (IS) field in the literature. The main objective of this research is to build up the knowledge body of stakeholder applications in information systems and technology areas. © 2013, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 84 major banks in East Asia (China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) and the USA is used to test the links between CSR and brand value using ANOVA and multiple regressions. Findings: Brand value is positively related to CSR for the entire sample, but is associated with distinctively different CSR factors depending on the geographic markets. In Japan and South Korea brand value is associated with a bank's appreciation for its employees, while in China, brand value is linked to a focus on the community. East Asia's culture is rooted in Confucianism, a philosophy that emphasises caring for the ""greater good"" (i.e. for the community) and for one's subordinates. In contrast, Americans are more concerned with ""green"" issues, and subsequently caring for the environment is associated with brand value. In addition, corporate governance, or regulatory compliance, has a strong relationship with brand value for American banks. Research limitations/implications: The study emphasises the complexity of global brand management given that eastern and western companies exhibit distinct patterns regarding brand value. Specifically, our study shows that the links between CSR and brand value vary substantially between different countries and regions. Originality/value: This study investigates the association between CSR and brand value and establishes that different CSR aspects are linked to brand value for banks in East Asia and the USA. The study also establishes that CSR is not a universal concept, given that such distinct brand value-CSR links have been found for the different geographic markets under investigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand value; China; Community; Compliance; Confucianism; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; CSR; East Asia; Employees; Environment; Japan; Korea",,"Bouvain, P.; University of Canberra and Macquarie University, North Ryde, Australia; email: Petra.bouvain@canberra.edu.au",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02652323,,,,"English","Int.

The empirical analysis, based on a sample of 126 firms drawn from the S&P500 group of companies over a 5-year period, suggests that board gender diversity (BGD) significantly affects CSP. However, this impact depends on the social performance metric under investigation. In particular, more gender diverse boards exert stronger influence on CSP metrics focusing on 'negative' business practices, such as the 'concerns' dimension of the Kinder Lydenberg Domini, Inc. (KLD) ratings. This is because such CSP ratings have the potential to induce higher levels of 'empathic caring', which strongly appeals to female directors.

However, consumers should previously be aware of these actions and its communication should project a social motivation of the firm. This paper focuses on these two requirements by analysing the relationship between CSR actions awareness and brand value. The moderating role of attribution is also tested. Results show that CSR actions awareness positively and significantly improves the two components of brand value: attitude towards the brand and brand uniqueness perception. The moderating role of attribution is also confirmed for the first relationship when objectives are perceived as altruist. Managerial implications are derived from these results stressing the needing of a strategic perspective to integrate CSR and brand management that should be directed by honesty and long-range commitment.

The model is based on two dimensions: the ""CSR development"" dimension and the ""CSR commitment"" dimension. The CSR development dimension allows decision makers to position companies with respect to the stage of their CSR cultural evolution, whereas the CSR commitment dimension assesses companies' degree of commitment based on their economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic CSR performance.

Through this I present three key findings. First, I establish that a number of CSR TMT positions exist and I list all identified corporations and associated position titles. Second, I show that Scandinavian corporations are significantly more likely than U. S. corporations to have such CSR TMT positions. This finding serves as evidence that the U. S. may have been surpassed by a subset of Europe, i. e., Scandinavia, in at least one relevant measure of explicit CSR, whereby this study may serve witness to a noteworthy juncture post Matten and Moon's (Academy of Management Review, 33(2):404-424, 2008) ""Implicit & Explicit CSR"" article. And third, I show that corporations with a CSR TMT position are three times more likely to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) than corporations with none. A range of further research opportunities stemming from these findings include exploring whether explicit attention to CSR by the corporation is indicative of a longer term trend that has to do with attention to responsible business and whether a move away from the expression 'CSR' toward the expression 'sustainability' is underway and what this may entail. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","C-Suite; Chief Officer of CSR; Chief Sustainability Officer; Explicit CSR; Scandinavia; Top management team; U.S.",,"Strand, R.; Copenhagen Business School, Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility (cbsCSR), Porcelænshaven 18A, Ground Floor, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; email: rs.ikl@cbs.dk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

The paper explores the organisational characteristics driving two key capabilities needed for effective MSI: stakeholder dialogue and knowledge integration. Based on the empirical evidence from four business cases, the research follows an explorative approach building upon stakeholder and organisational learning theories.

Findings: The research reveals that locals and stakeholders receive sufficient information from the media, especially Labuanfm, but stakeholders could be more responsible and efficient in channeling the required information for the continued sustenance of rural homestay tourism as a viable economic activity. Practical implications: The study recommends that stakeholders offer additional commitment as formal assistance for homestay entrepreneurs is not a healthy option in the face of competitive development of modern hotel accommodation.

Further, most studies of this question rely solely on the views of investors who already invest in SRI funds. Our study surveys a unique pool of approximately 5,000 investors that contains both investors who have used SRI criteria in investment decisions and those who have not, and involves a broad array of criteria associated with SR investing. Our findings offer new insight into the SRI debate. For both sets of investors, environmental and sustainability issues dominate as the major category associated with SR investing. We find strong agreement in the ranking of the relative importance of various SRI factors despite differences between these two groups in their opinion of their overall importance. We also find that investors prefer to consider the SRI question in more holistic terms rather than using the exclusionary format favored by most SRI funds. Investors seem to prefer to reward firms who display overall positive social behavior rather than to exclude firms on the basis of certain products or practices. These findings can help providers of SR investment vehicles to improve the SRI products that they offer to the general investor, thus both encouraging the initial adoption of SR criteria by investors and increasing overall investment in SR choices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Environment; Investor survey; Negative screening; Socially responsible investing",,"Berry, T.

It summarizes the purpose of the book which is to explore through both descriptive and conceptual means the use of power by institutional investors in bringing about changes to corporate behavior, so that corporations engage in improved environmental, social, and governance actions. Methodology/approach -This chapter reviews literature and chapters and offers conceptual development. Findings -The forces driving the actions of institutional investors are different from many other shareholders being determined by a unique set of costs, benefits, and objectives. As such three general categories of institutional elements constrain and guide this behavior: regulative elements which include constitutions, laws, and property rights; normative elements which include informal norms, values, and codes of conduct; and cultural-cognitive elements which include shared beliefs, identities, and mental models. It highlights the role of regulation and ""soft"" law, the impact of values and customs, and the way sense-making and cognition impacts on decisions and actions. Practical/social implications -The chapter highlights the interplay between hard and soft law in progressing the agenda. It seems that hard law is a hygiene factor forming the base on which initial gains can be made in the application of institutional shareholder power. Moreover, the use of soft law such as the Global Reporting Initiative and the newly founded Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, institutional investors can gain improved disclosure of sustainability performance to incorporate into their investment decisions. Moreover, it highlights the gaps in the use of the power that exists. The movement is still emerging with the focus on corporate governance and environmental considerations primarily. There are still improvements to be made for institutional investors in the social aspects of the responsibility agenda as well in pushing companies to be more transparent, improve reporting, and engage in more long-term decision-making. Originality/value -The chapter contributes to the debate on governance convergence between liberal market economies (LMEs) and coordinated market economies (CMEs). It is important to look beyond national characteristics alone and demonstrate that organizations, even though they are impacted by institutions, are not necessarily passive acceptors of their fate. Hence this chapter highlights that in expanding from a dyadic approach comparing LMEs and CMEs, the strategic choice of decision-makers, the power of the actors, and the processes used by institutional investors in changing corporate behavior are important considerations.

We have carried out a content analysis of the websites of 102 Spanish local governments. Subsequently, we have employed different statistical techniques (biplots and dependence models) to analyse the extent of disclosure and to determine the impact of certain contextual and political factors on transparency in matters of sustainability. When compared to the amount of information that is revealed concerning financial issues, disclosure practices regarding social and environmental information are rather scarce. We have also observed that several political factors, more specifically, the presence of conservative governments and political rivalry, may become genuine barriers to municipal transparency. Based on these findings, we can make two policy recommendations. First, it seems necessary to establish national policies, laws or recommendations that generate similar levels of transparency among local governments in order to avoid social dilemmas. In this sense, similar accountability processes limit non-sustainable behaviours, playing a similar role to that of markets for the private sector. Second, accountability processes should focus on the addition of information concerning social and environmental actions and on informing of the effects of municipalities on them, going beyond the strictly economic dimension. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The current conceptual accountability frameworks are dramatically inadequate in the context of escalating sustainability issues and needs of both society and business. The business responses, through corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, voluntary sustainability reports and industry standards are only a poor attempt to address the fundamental sustainable development challenges.

To address this aim, the paper posits three main research questions: whether there is a theory able to explain the relationship between IC and CSR (RQ1); whether empirical surveys provide evidence of the links between CSR activities (CSRA) and IC (RQ2); and whether organizations have started to disclose social and intangible issues in a single document within the Italian context (RQ3). Design/methodology/approach: To answer the RQs, we decided to arrange three different literature reviews. In detail, to address RQ1, we searched for theoretical studies focussing on an resource-based view (RBV) perspective of IC or CSR or both. To address RQ2, we searched for empirical studies addressed to test the links between CSRA and the creation and development of organizational IC. To address RQ3, we searched for empirical studies focussing on companies' experiences of integration of CSR and IC reports or on surveys on this theme in the Italian context. Findings: All the three literature reviews provide evidence that the trend to move towards an integration of social and IC issues in a single report is a plausible issue, from a theoretical, management and disclosure point of view. Research limitations/implications: The main limit of the research lies in its theoretical nature; however, the study can provide an impulse for further research on the existing trend in the real-life context, and can also provide the theoretical basis on which to build a model that, starting from the relationships among the different kinds of voluntary reports, provides the criteria and methods to integrate the firm's corporate voluntary reports in a single report. For researchers, this result also has an implication to control for intangibles, for example, assessing the relationship between CSR and corporate performance may explain some of the mixed findings that have occurred in the past. Practical implications: The article inserts CSR and IC within the RBV theory. Such recognition provides managers the theoretical framework to treat them conjointly, being aware that these two dimensions are intertwined. The article also provides evidence that CSRA impact on IC creation and development. The main implication for company managers is that, when developing a strategy aimed at strengthening IC, they should consider not only all components of intellectual capital but, above all, also include CSR actions and attributes in strategy formulation. Finally, the article provides evidence of a trend towards an integration of CSR and IC reports within the Italian territory. An integrated CSR-IC approach could have relevant implications on the development of the Italian territory characterized by a large number of SMEs and networks of firms that are an integral part of the local community, whose success is often related to their capability to acquire consensus from local stakeholders such as employees, public authorities, financial organizations, banks, suppliers and citizens. Originality/value: The article provides three main contributions: first, the paper suggests that the integration of the two different perspectives IC and CSR finds its theoretical justification in the RBV theory, which is scarcely applied to explain the link between these two perspectives; second, the article provides evidence of the real effects that investments in CSR have on the maintenance and developing of organizational IC; third, it provides evidence that there is a trend moving towards an integration of social and IC issues in a single report in the Italian context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility report; Intellectual capital report; Literature review; Resource-based view",,"Veltri, S.; Department of Business Administration and Law, University of CalabriaItaly",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Companies have responded by developing corporate social responsibility strategies to demonstrate their commitment to both the societies within which they function and to the protection of the natural environment. This has often involved a move towards greater transparency in company practice and a desire to engage with stakeholders, often including many of the campaign organisations that have been at the forefront of the criticisms of their activity. This article examines the ways in which stakeholder dialogue has impacted upon the relationships between NGOs and businesses. In doing so, it contributes to the call for more 'stakeholder-focused' research in this field (Frooman in Acad Manag Rev 24(2): 191-205, 1999; Steurer in Bus Strategy Environ 15: 15-69 2006). By adopting a stakeholder lens, and focusing more heavily upon the impact on one particular stakeholder community (NGOs) and looking in depth at one form of engagement (stakeholder dialogue), this article examines how experiences of dialogue are strategically transforming interactions between businesses and NGOs. It shows how experiences of stakeholder dialogue have led to transformations in the drivers for engagement, transformations in the processes of engagement and transformations in the terms of engagement. Examining these areas of transformation, the article argues, reveals the interactions at play in framing and shaping the evolving relationships between business and its stakeholders. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business-NGOs relationships; Corporate social responsibility; Stakeholder dialogue",,"Cook, J.; Hull University Business School, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull, United Kingdom; email: Joanne.Cook@hull.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

TBL sustainability transitions a firm's attention away from solely focusing on short-term profits to a concentration on the firm's long-term environmental, social, and economic performance. The study suggests that this transition to practicing TBL sustainability can result in ""competitive synergy"" for hospitality firms. The term ""competitive synergy"" is used to describe the phenomenon of when the anticipated benefits (e.g. reduced energy costs) from focusing on sustainability coalesce with the unanticipated benefits (e.g. increased employee job satisfaction) to make hospitality firms more competitive. One interviewee describes this synergy as a ""resonant harmonic"" because of the multiple benefits gained that were not part of the original motivations for engaging in sustainability. In an attempt to demonstrate industry examples of competitive synergy, three hospitality case studies practicing TBL sustainability are presented. These cases studies range from a small boutique hotel in Floyd, VA (Hotel Floyd), to a Caribbean resort in the Dominican Republic (Puntacana), and even to one of the world's largest hotel groups (InterContinental).

The behaviour of the asset class sustainable real estate (SRE) together with its diversification characteristics are the main focus. Design/methodology/approach: The study is an explorative empirical analysis applying a portfolio optimisation algorithm. First, the authors developed a sustainable real estate index comprehending listed real estate companies from 2004 until 2010 acting in line with a CSR agenda. Second, the authors introduced SRE into the opportunity set of an UK investor and finally, generated the theoretical optimal asset allocation of SRE within different risk-return portfolios. Findings: The unique risk-return pattern of SRE enables the asset class to be allocated across all portfolios ranging from low to high risk along the efficient frontier. In the low-risk levels, SRE behaves as a diversifier whereas in the medium- to high-risk portfolios SRE is represented as the main allocated asset. Sustainable real estate thus offers opportunities to numerous investors in view of their investment preferences and corporate strategies. Practical implications: The results could encourage institutional investors to take investments in CSR-driven listed real estate companies into account and to rethink their strategic asset allocation approach in view of the identified asset characteristics and the behaviour within a portfolio framework. Originality/value: The paper provides a first insight in the field of portfolio management by introducing SRE into the opportunity set of a UK investor.

The skills, knowledge, and the cultural proneness toward social issues of the Fondazione MPS are successfully transferred to the bank and shape its social strategy. Research limitations -This chapter suffers of the limitations generally associated to the case study research methodology. In particular, the findings of this study can be extended to other cases only after a detailed examination of market wide, institutional and corporate governance differences. Social implications -The positive relationship between nonprofit institutional investors and the CSR strategy effectiveness unveils corporate governance mechanisms useful to increase the overall value creation process of the organizations. Originality/value of the chapter -This study contributes to the CSR literature by analyzing if and how the philanthropic nature of the blockholders affect the CSR policies carried out by the entities they control.

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of annual reports and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports for the year 2010 of the top 100 A-share companies listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange was conducted to investigate the extent of greenhouse gas reporting. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the factors driving these companies' greenhouse gas reporting. Findings: It was found that most Chinese companies reported neutral and good news. The results also indicate larger companies operating in an industry which has higher level of carbon dioxide emissions tend to have higher levels of greenhouse gas disclosures, consistent with the expectation of legitimacy theory. However, profitability and overseas listing were not significantly related to greenhouse gas reporting. This is consistent with the findings of previous literature. Finally, contrary to expectations, state-owned companies report less greenhouse gas information than private companies. Originality/value: The paper contributes towards theory development by testing legitimacy theory in the context of greenhouse gas reporting by Chinese companies and contributes to existing literature on greenhouse gas reporting by focussing on the large emerging economy of China.

We find that not only are power asymmetries between actors veiled through the universalization of interests, but reporting can also be seen as a communicative action that provides a right to define the role of societal actors for the achievement of CSR.

We focus on employment brand-related predictors, specifically perceptions linked to the provision of unique employment experiences, organizational identity strength, perceived prestige, and judgments of whether the acquiring organization acts in accordance with its corporate identity claims.

These judgments also predict subsequent levels of discretionary effort and long-term intent to leave, as do perceptions linked to the provision of unique employment experiences.

However, as demonstrated by previous scholars, SMEs have been critically discussed because they provide lack of proper sustainability disclosure. The fact that the predominant approach of SMEs toward social responsibility is often ""sunken"" and not ""explicit"" can drive the lack of disclosure. Furthermore, unstructured communication practices create difficulties in measuring and reporting the sustainability reporting phenomenon in SMEs. The aim of our study is to shed light on the activity of SMEs' sustainability reporting and disclosure, specifically, by addressing the variables that influence the choice of the guidelines used to prepare sustainability reports. Design/methodology/approach-The research has been carried out by using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The empirical evidence is based on all the Italian companies, mostly SMEs, that were certified in 2011 as having adopted both environmental (i.e., ISO14001 or EMAS) and social (i.e., SA8000) management systems. A multivariate linear regression model has been developed to address the influence of several variables (i.e., financial performance, size, time after achievement of the certifications, group/conglomerate control, etc.) on the guidelines' choice for preparing sustainability reports. Findings-Our findings demonstrate that SMEs prefer to use simple guidelines such as those guidelines that are mandatory under management system certifications. However, the sustainability disclosure driven by the adoption of international guidelines may be more complex if the SME is controlled within a group of companies or if a significant amount of time has passed since the certification date. As such, we developed a taxonomy of their different behavioral drivers according to a legitimacy theory approach. Research limitations-At this stage, our study didn't focus on the contents' quality of the disclosure and reporting practices adopted by SMEs, which is obviously a worthwhile and important area for further research. Furthermore, the analysis took into account the impact of a number of easily accessible variables; therefore, it can be extended to investigate the effect on disclosure of other relevant variables (i.e., nature of the board of directors, age, and industrial sector in which the company operates) as well as contexts prevailing in other countries. Practical implications-The study represents an important contribution for understanding how and why managers might use externally focused disclosure on social and environmental issues to benefit the company's legitimacy. Social implications-Our study provides interesting insights for policy makers who require social or environmental certification when calling for tenders or specific EU contracts, in order to put aside the ""brand"" or ""symbol"" and really focus on the disclosed practices. Originality/value-Previous studies have provided only a few evidence about reporting practices and related influencing features of SMEs' sustainability actions. As such, the study wishes to make a significant contribution to the existing literature on Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) by providing relevant insights about the factors which influence the guidelines used by SMEs in preparing their sustainability reports.

The authors employed a US sample covering the period 1998-2007. Design/methodology/approach - In the context of the Fama and French model augmented by momentum and industry factors, the authors test the significance of the alpha for a CSP difference portfolio, defined as high-ranked minus low-ranked CSP stocks. Findings - The results are consistent with the ""no-linkage"" hypothesis, which argues that no significant difference in the risk-adjusted performance is expected between high- and low-ranked CSP-formed portfolios. Furthermore, little evidence was found that high- or low-ranked CSP-formed portfolios, irrespective of the portfolio formation type, systematically differ with regard to performance, size, book-to-market or momentum factors. Originality/value - The authors employ sustainability CSP rankings that focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) materiality factors, in contrast to many prior studies that solely use KLD ratings or just focus on a subarea of CSP. Moreover, the authors' dataset considerably improves upon previous studies employing similar data in which individual company rankings are not available.

Companies argue that reports help communities better understand the importance of the benefits created by mining. However, we argue that sustainability reporting can only play a role in improving a company's performance and reputation if the quality of the reported data is good enough to answer community-raised contentious issues and if such are tackled through a stakeholder engagement process which includes 'anti-mining' groups. The paper examines a mining conflict in Argentina's Bajo de la Alumbrera open pit mine. The assessment is based on a content analysis of Alumbrera's Sustainability Report (SR), primarily from 2009, complemented with insights from the 2010 and 2011 reports. The study reveals that environmental and economic indicators are the most contentious and least reported.

Corporate governance as well as the way national and local governments practise governance can have direct impact on communities located in areas near to extractive industries and even further afield. However, although risk analyses are considered in feasibility studies, including the conduct of environmental impact assessments of mining investments, what has attracted less attention are the consequences of poor governance in managing/mitigating risks when communities which traditionally are 'resource guardians' are not consulted during stakeholder discussions as part of investment negotiations. Academic literature and popular media are replete with examples of the high price paid by some communities, including loss of lives and livelihoods, when investors and governments ignore opportunities for meaningful engagement with stakeholders. And, although recommendations have been made on how to improve meaningful stakeholder engagement, the various discussions/articles have not revealed consensus on how best to create meaningful stakeholder engagement in regions rich in natural resources sometimes described as suffering from 'resource curse'. In considering ways in which meaningful stakeholder engagement could convert the resource curse into 'resource blessings', the question may well be asked, what are the indicators of meaningful stakeholder engagement and how can this be strengthened through greater transparency in governance? Drawing on a case study of diamond mining in Botswana and the mining of platinum in South Africa, this chapter provides an overview of approaches to risk assessment by companies and governments and examines key indicators of governance which impact on the lives and livelihoods of communities directly affecting by mining operations. In addition, the author highlights how risks associated with poor governance can derail attainment of development objectives as well as opportunities that act as catalysts in transforming communities and meeting national development objectives.

Many more companies have come under the spotlight of activist attention as the agenda social activists address has expanded, provoked in part by the internationalization of business. During the past fifteen years, companies have begun to formulate corporate responsibility (CR) policies and appointed management teams dedicated to CR, resulting in a change in the way companies interact with social activists. This paper presents findings from a longitudinal case study of managerial responses to social activism targeted at a company with relatively well-advanced CR practices and reputation. The case describes the unfolding of the internal processes over an 8-year period, including the role played by different managers and the tensions in the decision-making processes. The findings emphasize how values and beliefs in the company interact with economic arguments and how those are mediated through functions and relationships in the company and beyond. The paper shows how critical managers' understanding of the motivations of activists behind the campaign is in shaping their actions. It reveals the paradoxical outcomes that can result from social activism at the level of the firm, the industry, and the field. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate responsibility; Cybernetic model; Dynamic interactions and responses; Outcomes; Social activism",,"Van Cranenburgh, K.

In the 1970s and 1980s, studies mostly originated from Anglo-Saxon and Western European countries. During the last two decades research on responsibility reporting was increasingly undertaken in emerging and developing countries as well - always following the reporting practices of the respective businesses. Consequentially, a very large number of studies exist today. Many of these have empirically investigated the determinants of responsibility reporting and examined whether internal factors like size and industry or external factors like stakeholder pressures have an impact on disclosure. Thus, the purpose of the following paper is twofold. First, it seeks to provide an overview of the existing literature in order to facilitate further research. Overall, 186 studies have been examined for the determinants which they considered and have been grouped according to their geographical origin. This provides for an analysis of whether academics from different regions have taken different approaches to the empirical examination of responsibility reporting and if their results differed. The findings show that scholars across regions have taken different paths in empirical research, but indications for a variation in the impact of specific determinants on reporting are weak. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Accountability; Corporate responsibility; Disclosure; Environmental policy; Literature review; Meta-analysis; Social and environmental reporting; Sustainability; Sustainable development","accountability; comparative study; corporate strategy; empirical analysis; environmental policy; firm size; literature review; meta-analysis; stakeholder; sustainability; Western Europe","Fifka, M.S.; International Business Ethics and Sustainability, Cologne Business School (CBS), Hardefuststrasse 1, 50677 Köln, Germany; email: m.fifka@cbs-edu.de",,,09644733,,,,"English","Bus.

We argue that a firm's competitive advantage fundamentally depends on its capacity for stakeholder management related, transformational adaptation over time. Our new temporal stakeholder management approach builds upon insights from both the resource-based view (RBV) in strategic management and institutional theory. Stakeholder agendas and their relative salience to the firm evolve over time, a phenomenon well understood in the literature, and requiring what we call level 1 adaptation. However, the dominant direction of stakeholder pressures can also change, namely, from supporting resource heterogeneity at the firm level to fostering industry homogeneity, and vice versa. When dominant stakeholder pressures shift from supporting heterogeneity towards stimulating homogeneity in industry, the firm must engage in level 2 or transformational adaptation. Stakeholders typically provide valuable resources to the firm in an early stage. Without these resources, which foster heterogeneity (in line with RBV thinking), the firm would not exist. At a later stage, stakeholders also contribute to inter-firm homogeneity via isomorphism pressures (in line with institutional theory thinking). Adding a temporal dimension to stakeholder management theory has far reaching implications for this theory's practical relevance to senior level management in business. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Competitive advantage; Institutional theory; Resource-based view; Stakeholder management theory; Temporal perspective",,"Verbeke, A.; McCaig Chair in Management, Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4, Canada; email: averbeke@ucalgary.ca",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Arguably, the frontrunner businesses that orient themselves towards sustainable market transitions develop a competitive advantage by co-creating these sustainable markets and on the short term develop renewed ambition and enthusiasm. By means of the transition framework, we argue that the fundamental societal changes emerging lead to a new phase in corporate responsibility, implying fundamental transitions within businesses.

The analysis reveals that attributes shared with clannish stakeholders gradually replace attributes of a claimed identity, and that, when confronting hostile stakeholders, organizations act in solidarity with clannish stakeholders.

This study examines an ethic of care approach to crisis management analysing the case of Northern Rock bank which was at the centre of the recent financial crisis in the UK. The development and maintenance of relationships is fundamental to an ethic of care approach and the research recognises this by examining the bank-stakeholder relationship both before and after the crisis. Considerable anger was directed at the bank post-crisis and, subsequently, the management team resigned. An important contention is that because an ethic of care approach had not been followed external parties judged that management should have foreseen the crisis and the harm caused was deemed intentional, even though predicting the crisis would have been difficult and it is improbable any harm was intended. Additionally, this negative reaction was heightened due to three facets of Northern Rock's history: (i) its previous existence as a building society, (ii) the 'local' nature of the bank and (iii) the creation of The Northern Rock Foundation. These historical factors caused local stakeholders to presume a 'caring' relationship between themselves, and the bank had continued to exist post-demutualisation. The events of the crisis compelled stakeholders to re-appraise this presumption, amplifying the post-crisis anger. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bank; Crisis; Crisis management; Ethic of care; Foresight; Intention",,"Linsley, P.

This conflict mineral is used in many consumer electronics, which raises the issue of what consumers and companies are doing to take action against this issue. This study uses the issue of child labour to mine coltan for cell phones to assess the ethical impact on consumers of the cell phone industry. Consumer awareness leads to an assessment of revised social features (Auger et al., 2003), which looks at the existence of price premiums and purchase intentions. The willingness-to-pay for social features leads to ethical consumerism, which positively reinforces the continued focus on corporate responsibility among businesses. Survey results analysing the issue are used to show that consumers identify child labour as socially unjust and consumers are willing to pay more for phones that can be certified as child labour-free.

Using a cross-country case approach, this article explores the role of stakeholders in the marketing capability-building processes of INVs in Ireland, Sweden, and Denmark. The study reveals that different stakeholders play a critical role in influencing how INVs build their marketing capabilities to respond effectively to the dynamic nature of international markets in which they operate. The results show that different stakeholder groups (allied, cooperative, neutral, and entrepreneur) can influence the learning processes (single-, double-, and triple-loop) of the firm and can determine the nature of dynamic marketing capabilities (incremental, renewing, and regenerative) needed to create and sustain international competitive advantage. Furthermore, ""effectuation logic"" can explain how entrepreneurs manage and leverage stakeholder relationships in marketing capability processes to cocreate value for the firm. By incorporating dynamic capabilities, stakeholder, and learning theories, this study offers a dynamic, process-oriented model for INV research and provides much-needed qualitative insights into the dynamic capabilities theory of the firm. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Case method; Dynamic capabilities; International new ventures; Marketing capabilities; Stakeholders",,"Evers, N.; J.E.

The Straits of Malacca and Singapore, which connect the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean is considered one of the busiest waterways in the world, a vital trade and communication link to the international shipping community. In 2010 the Malaysian Marine Department recorded traffic of 74,136 ships through the Klang Vessel Traffic System (VTS). The high vessel-traffic in these waters presents regulatory and operational challenges, not the least of which are the risk of accidents and the need to maintain effective navigational systems. By virtue of Article 41, 42 and 43 of the 1982 LOSC, the burden of responsibility lies on the Strait States, especially in regard to navigational safety and pollution prevention. The case is argued in this article, however, for User States, contributing to the maintenance of safety of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. This article analyses the concept of CSR and how it is adopted by the User States, i.e., the shipping companies. The findings reveal that CSR of the shipping companies is addressed through voluntary contributions and cooperative mechanisms. The CSR also complies with relevant laws and regulations related to safety and pollution (for example MARPOL 73/78, SOLAS 1974, International Safety Management Code). The concepts of voluntary contribution and cooperative mechanism are derived from obligations established under Article 43 of the 1982 LOSC.","Corporate social responsibility; The 1982 law of the sea; The straits of malacca and singapore",,"Wan Dahalan, W.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper is deductive. It tests two main hypotheses: first, the social report is value relevant because it explains firm value; second, the social report influences the value-relevance of accounting variables. The study applies the value-relevance analysis on a sample of 178 Italian companies listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Findings - The estimates show a significant negative correlation between the publication of a social report and the stock price. Furthermore, book value per share accounting information is more relevant for the companies that publish a social report, whereas the relevance of earnings per share does not change for these companies.

In this study, we present research on the contribution to consumer satisfaction of the perceived CSR of three car manufacturers in terms of labor practices, community development and environmental performance within a group of 329 Portuguese car buyers and users. These consumers valued environmental performance much more than activities related to labor practices and community development. However, determinants outside the realm of CSR, such as perceived product and service quality and empathy with the brand, were much more important for Portuguese consumers than CSR.

This paper explores the 30-year journey taken by mining giant, Alcoa of Australia, as they addressed their social and environmental responsibilities. In particular, the focus is on the collaborative relationship between Alcoa of Australia and the environmental nonprofit organization, Greening Australia.

Therefore, the author has surveyed the image of CSR considered by students. Consequently, only 6.6% of university students could explain the word, ""CSR"". When asked abut what their image of CSR was, examples such as ""not doing injustice"", ""giving support during times of disaster,"" or ""protecting the environment"" etc. were often given. The following results were obtained: 5.0% of the students had both heard and knew the contents of the word; 12.5% had heard the word and knew the meaning but did not know the contents; 33.0% had heard the word but did not know the meaning! 49.5% had not heard the word before. In addition, it was found that university students, particularly in regards to the medical and cosmetic industries, desire products of value or service offers and social action; however, according to the results there were few desires in regards to trading companies. In the future, CSR needs to be taught at educational institutions. On top of understanding the meaning of CSR, we must aim to increase the number of youth who can propose what to do about it. As the results of these surveys, we must teach CSR to students in educational facilities. Also, they should learn many concrete examples from companies in order to practice CSR in their immediate circle.

To the best of the author's knowledge, no other study has compared managers' CSR attitudes within such a combination of organizational contexts. The findings from this study indicate that some considerations with regards to CSR are transferable across organizational contexts (i.e. issues around the attainability of CSR, emphasis given to ethics and integrity and managers associating CSR with employee-related activities), while others are context specific. The context-specific ones show that organizational culture and an organization's position in the non-profit/for-profit continuum are key contextual influences on managers' CSR attitudes. Moreover, influences relating to individual managers' work, as well as the extent to which CSR is an implicit or an explicit part of decision-making determine managerial perceptions of CSR. The implications for management practice (i.e. a one-size-fits-all approach to CSR practice is wrong) and CSR research (i.e. more context-sensitive and interdisciplinary research) are discussed.

In the context of the literature on the institutionalization of CSR and on critical CSR, it presents two main findings. First, it contributes to the CSR mainstream literature by confirming that CSR has not only become institutionalized in society but that a form of this institution is also present within MNCs. Secondly, it contributes to the critical CSR literature by suggesting that unlike broader notions of CSR shared between multiple stakeholders, MNCs practise a form of CSR that undermines the broader stakeholder concept. By increasingly focusing on strategic forms of CSR activity, MNCs are moving away from a societal understanding of CSR that focuses on redressing the impacts of their operations through stakeholder concerns, back to any activity that supports traditional business imperatives. The implications of this shift are considered using institutional theory to evaluate macro-institutional pressures for CSR activity and the agency of powerful incumbents in the contested field of CSR. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business case; Corporate social responsibility; Critical perspectives; Institutional theory; Multi-national corporations",,"Bondy, K.; School of Management, University of Bath, Claverton Campus, Bath, BA2 7AY, United Kingdom; email: k.bondy@bath.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

In the post-tsunami period, the authors interviewed 23 senior executives at ten prominent companies in Sri Lanka. Nine of the companies responded to the tsunami with philanthropy based CSR initiatives. Interviews with three senior executives at the family-owned enterprise MAS Holdings revealed an explicitly strategic CSR approach. MAS Holdings, an apparel manufacturer owned by three brothers, is Victoria Secret's lead strategic partner and an ethical buying source for other well-known apparel retailers. This paper examines the organizational virtuousness of MAS Holdings' strategic CSR initiatives. The analysis uses Bright et al.'s (2006) conceptualization of organizational virtuousness in terms of the three dimensions of human impact, moral goodness and unconditional societal betterment. The case study findings for MAS Holdings illustrate how strategic CSR initiatives could be virtuous due to positive contributions to the community in those dimensions despite generating profits, publicity and reputation advantageous to the firm. While the empirical findings are limited to one company in Sri Lanka in the post-tsunami period, the paper discusses the broader implications of and directions for future research into the organizational virtuousness of strategic CSR. © 2012.","Asia; Corporate social responsibility; Organizational virtuousness; Sri Lanka; Strategic corporate social responsibility",,"Fernando, M.; School of Management and Marketing, Faculty of Commerce, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia; email: mariof@uow.edu.au",,,02632373,,,,"English","Eur.

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Sustainable development (SD) are not new concepts and are some of the most widely recognized and used business concepts today. It seems that the implementation of both CSR and SD is needed in a modern and global business context. Although CSR and SD are regarded as different concepts, there is a clear overlap, interrelationship and interconnectedness between these concepts. It seems advantageous to at a practical level implement CSR and SD simultaneously as the tridimensional view of SD mimics the tridimensional view of CSR. It is acknowledged that although SD and CSR both include a tridimensional view and they are closely connected, there are different conceptual nuances.

Based on multiple case studies of 16 firms, the article examines the CSR philosophy and approach in China's emerging market. The findings suggest that Chinese CSR understanding is largely grounded in the context of ethical and discretionary actions. This focus is mainly attributed to the dominant role of ethical leadership, governmental dependency, and cultural traditions in Chinese CSR. Moreover, the weakness or the absence of conducive social normative environment and positive peer pressure, and misalignment between CSR and organizational design further contribute to a lack of systemic and institutionalized approach to CSR in China. Our study implies that CSR is still evolving at a preliminary stage in China, and institutional infrastructure and cultural ethics are exerting abiding influence on CSR approach in the emerging economies.

But the existing research provides comparatively little knowledge about: (1) how companies strategically manage the relationship with the state through corporate social responsibility (CSR); (2) how this strategy takes shape under the influence of political institutions. Understanding these questions captures a realistic picture of how a company applies CSR to interacting with the state, particularly in countries where the state relationship is critical to the business operation. This article draws on political legitimacy as a useful concept to directly address both strategic and politically embedded natures of CSR. This work extends the currently under-specified political implication of the strategic view of CSR and provides fresh insights to the political legitimacy research by specifying a typology of CSR-based legitimacy strategies and its contextual variation. China and Russia are the focal settings. A qualitative analysis of business-state interaction cases is done using a database that contains the majority of CSR reports published in Chinese and Russian as the end of 2009. As a result, this paper identifies four qualitatively different types of CSR-based political legitimacy strategies and reveals how the adoption of these strategies differs across Chinese companies, Russian companies, and multinational corporations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business-state interaction; China; Corporate social responsibility; Multinational corporation; Political embeddedness; Political legitimacy; Russia",,"Zhao, M.; SKOLKOVO Institute for Emerging Market Studies, Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO, Novaya ul. 100, Skolkovo Village, Odintsovsky District, Moscow Region, Russian Federation; email: Meng_Zhao@skolkovo.ru",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Is it a way forward on this issue as decisive as complex? These questions reveal the ambivalence of private actors. Those can provide interesting initiatives and we cannot deny it.

For global transportation systems, seaports play a key role as transhipment hubs. As seaports incorporate and coordinate hinterland logistic activities within the activities of the port, the strategies they employ influence the decisions made by both local and global logistic service providers. From an environmental and social perspective, seaports are thus key actors in transportation systems, and many ports have also developed corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies. This paper examines one such strategy - green port dues - and shows how the integration of hinterland logistics and ports opens the possibility for differentiated port dues to be used as a tool to internalise external cost in the transportation systems and ensure the effectiveness of hinterland transport. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Hinterland transport; Intermodal transport; Port dues",,"Bergqvist, R.; Logistics and Transport Research Group, Department of Business Administration, School of Business, Economics and Law at the University of Gothenburg, P.O.

A survey designed in Arabic for the purpose of the study. Factor analysis and cluster analysis are both employed in this study in order to test the proposed model and address the research questions. Companies of the study are assigned to a predetermined four groups grid using nearest centroid sorting based on Euclidean distances. Syrian businessmen and managers could be classified into two groups according to their CSR perspectives and their marketing motivations. The two groups have similar perspectives regarding CSR. The group of majority, however, does not perceive CSR marketing incentives. Moreover, the dataset suggests that marketing is a weak motivation for CSR. This suggests that most Syrian businessmen and managers do perceive CSR as a matter of ethics but do not see ways to benefit from CSR practices as a marketing tool. Companies in Syria should be more supported by the government in order to bear the short term costs of CSR practices. Managers should seek ways to meet societal needs and development. The study should have taken the corporate incentives towards CSR with regard to each stakeholder group in order to identify the power and/or importance of each of these groups from Syrian managers' perspectives.

We argue that Excellence Theory's seemingly reluctant evolution has provided unsatisfactory treatments of concepts like power and activism, even though it has attempted to address some limitations of the symmetrical model's efficacy in responding to activist challenges. Excellence Theory's acknowledgment of once-vilified concepts like persuasion and power sets the stage for critical public relations theory and research to emerge as significantly more capable of addressing activist advocacy and concomitant issues. The paper argues that critical theory, buoyed by acceptance of its key concepts, its increasing access to presentation venues and journals sympathetic to once-marginalized, alternative perspectives, is poised to infiltrate the public relations orthodoxy. This possibility offers hope that once marginalized pluralistic approaches, especially critical public relations, may disrupt the colonization of the orthodoxy and infiltrate mainstream public relations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Activist; Critical; Excellence Theory; Persuasion",,"Coombs, W.T.; Nicholson School of Communication, University of Central Florida, P.O.

A strong focus on energy, waste, and water usage is directly linked with financial benefits in the operation of the hoteliers. Practices connected to the social aspect of sustainability are less developed. The dominant utilitarian paradigm in managers' decisions is a strong causal factor in the lack of systematic social activities. The economic driver seems to be too strong! The suggested research agenda will enable us to better explain this phenomenon in which companies include sustainable development in their strategy - as long as the benefits are visible. In this agenda a broad definition of sustainability is needed and more attention should be paid to the different stakeholders. Next to this stakeholder perspective also additional approaches such as change management are necessary. In line with this multiple-perspective approach both qualitative and quantitative methods to research the practices in and the motives for a more sustainable hospitality industry, are needed. Finally to understand motives and actual behavior of employee and guest toward sustainable alternatives, more experiment research designs are needed.

One important result is that the knowledge and the application of sustainability management tools are positively related. Furthermore, the application of sustainability management tools has increased throughout the period of the surveys. A main conclusion drawn from the empirical results is that increased knowledge, for example through the promotion of approaches and professional education, may be a driver of more frequent application and the dissemination of sustainability management tools, and may foster sustainable development.","Corporate social responsibility; corporate sustainability; D80; implementation; M10; M14; management system; sustainability management; tools",,"Schaltegger, S.; Leuphana Universität Lüneburg, Centre for Sustainability Management, Lüneburg, Germany",,,15889726,,,,"English","Soc.

Study 1 investigates consumer meanings of the term ethical and reveals that, contrary to philosophical scholars' exclusively consequentialist or nonconsequentialist positions, consumers' ethical judgments are a function of both these evaluation principles, illustrating that not any one scholarly definition of ethics alone is capable of capturing the content domain. The resulting conceptualisation identifies six key themes explicating the construct. Building upon these findings, studies 2 and 3 were conducted to operationalise CPE. Such operationalisation is an essential prerequisite for future explorations and theory development given the absence of a suitable tool to capture and quantify the strength and direction of CPE. The key focus was on developing a valid and reliable multi-item measurement tool that is practical, parsimonious and easy to administer.

There is a growing interest in sustainability, and, recently, books and articles have appeared that discuss sustainability accounting and reporting. A number of schools have developed standalone courses in sustainability accounting while others have integrated sustainability into existing courses in accounting ethics or corporate social responsibility. This chapter applies ecological, both organizational sociological and anthropological, approaches to argue in favor of integration of sustainability into the accounting curriculum rather than in standalone courses. These two approaches are utilized because these disciplines have well-established theoretical and methodological approaches that can be applied to study the subject of sustainability, natural resources conservation, and ecological management. In addition, the current trend in accounting education is for the incorporation of social and behavioral sciences perspectives, including sociology and anthropology, into the accounting curriculum. Accordingly, the application of the ecological approach from these disciplines contributes significantly to the study of the integration of sustainability into the accounting curriculum.

Design/methodology/approach: The problems are urgent and the style is polemical. Findings: Marketing is as old as human civilisation; it enables us to engage in the type of mutually beneficial exchange that makes cooperation possible. However, in the hands of the corporate sector, marketing is turning us into spoilt, consumption-obsessed children who are simultaneously wrecking our bodies, psyches and planet. The fiduciary duty of the corporation, which demands a single-minded focus on shareholder value, turns concepts such as consumer sovereignty, customer service and relationship marketing into corrosive myths that seduce us into quiescence, whilst furnishing big business with unprecedented power. Corporate social responsibility, meanwhile, is just a means of currying favour with our political leaders and further extending corporate power. Practical implications: Critical analysis is vital: if we do not want to become the apologists for corporate capitalism we have to research, write and teach about its failings as well as social marketing's potential to do good. We should also present solutions. As individuals we have enormous internal strength; collectively we have, and can again, change the world. Indeed marketing itself is a function of humankind's capacity to cooperate to overcome difficulties and long predates its co-option by corporations. In the hands of social marketers this potential force for good is being codified and deployed. If these talents and strengths can be combined with serious moves to contain the corporate sector, it is possible to rethink our economic and social priorities. Originality/value: The paper urges social marketers to take heed of and address marketing's failures if our discipline is to be taken seriously in debates about health, welfare and sustainability. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate power; Critical marketing; Global warming; Manipulation; Politics; Public health; Regulation; Social marketing; Tobacco",,"Hastings, G.; Institute for Social Marketing, University of Stirling, Stirling, United Kingdom; email: gerard.hastings@stir.ac.uk",,,20426763,,,,"English","J.

We further show that the factory hierarchy can influence the pattern of capital accumulation and economic change within the village. Our results demonstrate that the value chain cannot be treated as if it ends at the factory floor.

Some of IBM's suppliers already incorporated an environmental management consistent with IBM's requirements. However, many suppliers did not. While some suppliers might argue that implementing a new management system could increase operating costs, other suppliers may suggest that effective environmental management provides financial benefits through operational efficiencies, cost avoidance, and other opportunities.

The study adopts an exploratory approach, via in-depth semi-structured interviews, to reveal that five critical challenges hamper the operations of small businesses in Nigeria, namely: limited access to credit, high cost of doing business, inadequate infrastructure, inconsistent economic policies, and corruption and multiple taxes.

Since ports are indispensable nodes of supply chains involving many strategic stakeholders and activities interacting with each other, investigating the contribution of stakeholder relations on ports sustainability has emerged as a major concern. The main aim of this study is to provide a conceptual framework integrating the organizational relationships between supply chain and port stakeholders based on the theoretical background concerning the strategic management and the socially responsible marketing. This study attempts to identify the influence of supply chain stakeholders on sustainability of ports by considering the propositions of interdependencies, power imbalances, and strategic options within resource dependence theory. While this paper can be regarded as a review of port sustainability literature, the uniqueness lies on the consideration of the concept from the basis of resource dependence theory. Conceptual framework of this study suggests that ports should adopt strategies as insertion, integration and dominance for the management of interdependencies through the adoption of strategic tools to enhance effective stakeholder relations management and port sustainability.

At the same time, analysts have noted that the transformed regulatory and legislative environments of recent decades have encouraged firms to become much more politically active. Surprisingly, relatively little research has tied together these two trends. The present study integrates perspectives on stakeholder management with research on corporate political activity to develop an understanding of the structural sources of stakeholder mobilization in professional grassroots lobbying campaigns. This study employs a unique, original data source to consider how the adoption of grassroots lobbying by a firm relates to its industry, degree of inside lobbying, partisan PAC contributions, and more. This research shows that corporate grassroots lobbying is shaped most significantly by a firm's degree of inside lobbying, as highly active firms take a diversified strategy for gaining influence. Firms in industries with a heavy public presence as well as those concerned with taxation, government appropriations, and economic development also adopt these strategies readily. PAC contributions to Republican, but not Democratic, candidates also heighten firms' propensity to lobby the public. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","civic engagement; corporate political activity; political action committees; stakeholders, grassroots lobbying",,"Walker, E.

In contrast to past CSR studies, this research seeks to investigate the role of personality variables as moderating factors. Design/methodology/approach: The study tested hypotheses through an experiment using scenarios, addressing corporate social responsibility activities, manipulating domains like environmental protection, treatment of employees, and charitable giving. Findings: The results indicate that CSP influences consumer-firm emotional attachment and that this attachment constitutes an unrecognized mediational pathway in the CSP-loyalty link. The results identify the moderating and strengthening role of altruism, need-for-activity, and esteem-enhancement on the CSP-emotional attachment link. Finally, the study reveals that attributions are likely to moderate the influence of consumer altruism. Research limitations/implications: Although the CSP record scenarios reflected real corporate social responsibility practices, future studies employing field experiments or consumer surveys exploring the effects of actual corporate social responsibility initiatives would be valuable to enhance the external validity of these results. Practical implications: The study helps retailers towards improved and more targeted social responsibility investments. Specifically, retailers targeting consumer groups that are high in altruism, high in need for activity, and high in self-enhancement motives are probably in a more advantageous position when investing in CSR initiatives as a way to build and further deepen emotional attachment, and indirectly consumer loyalty. Originality/value: Building on the CSR and attachment literatures, the study investigates the extent to which CSP is capable of influencing customer loyalty through emotion-laden processes. Furthermore, in contrast to previous CSR studies, this study is one of the first to directly investigate whether consumer differences influence consumer reactions to CSR. Specifically, this study finds that differences in consumers' personality traits may affect the effectiveness of CSR initiatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Altruism; Consumer behaviour; Corporate social performance; Emotional attachment; Esteem enhancement; Market segmentation; Need for activity",,"Vlachos, P.

Recent research on the corporate social responsibility (CSR)-corporate financial performance (CFP) relationship proposes a variety of contextual and organizational factors to create a more robust link. However, few of these studies explore the role of the CSR engagement strategy. Drawing on absorptive capacity theory and related perspectives such as time compression diseconomies, asset mass efficiencies, and path dependence theory, we argue that when a firm engages in CSR slowly and consistently, focuses on related CSR dimensions, and starts with internal dimensions of CSR, CFP will be enhanced. With longitudinal data collected from 130 firms from 1995 to 2007, we find that firms benefit more when they adopt a CSR engagement strategy that is consistent, involves related dimensions of CSR, and begins with aspects of CSR that are more internal to the firm. The pace of the CSR engagement strategy, however, does not moderate the CSR-CFP relationship. This study helps fill the gap in CSR research by showing that, regardless of contextual factors, a firm can choose the proper strategy to enhance the financial benefits of the CSR engagement. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.","Absorptive capacity; Corporate social responsibility; CSR engagement strategy; Financial performance; Panel data analysis",,"Hull, C.E.; E.

Exploring the mainstream CSR agenda, this situation was echoed by widespread consensus on what was considered to be ""good practice"": reducing pollution, shutting down sweatshops, discouraging tax evasion, and so on. However, interpretation of these issues through the lens of moral pluralism unveils latent controversies. The moral appraisal of good practices within CSR depends on key moral concepts (such as harm, responsibility, intention, and consequences), which have various-and often incompatible-interpretations. In a nutshell, this article argues that from a moral pluralist standpoint, all CSR topics are potentially controversial. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Consensus; Controversies; Corporate social responsibility; Good practices; Morality; Pluralism",,"Eabrasu, M.; Department of Finance, Economics and Law, Groupe ESC Troyes en Champagne, 217, Avenue Pierre Brosolette, BP 710, 10002 Troyes Cedex, France; email: marian.eabrasu@get-mail.fr",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

A probable cause of these incidents is a lack of business ethics in the suppliers concerned. In the literature much has been suggested on the use of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to improve firms' ethical behaviors and on the use of supplier development (SD) to improve suppliers' capabilities. This research integrates the literature on CSR and SD to develop a new approach, called socially responsible supplier development (SRSD), to address suppliers' ethical problems. SRSD suggests leveraging a buying firms concerted supplier development efforts to improve its important suppliers' capabilities in CSR implementation. We develop and validate scales for measuring SRSD practices. In addition, we provide empirical evidence on the validity of existing CSR scales for Chinese manufacturing firms. Our results are based on analysis of the data of 160 pairs of buyer-supplier relationships in four manufacturing industries in China. The results indicate that all the scale items possess adequate reliability and validity to reflect SRSD and CSR.

Academics have already identified a few outcomes regarding CSR's impact on employees' attitudes and behaviours; however, studies explaining the underlying mechanisms that drive employees' favourable responses to CSR remain largely unexplored. Based on organizational identification (OI) theory, this study surveyed 155 employees of a petrochemical organization to better elucidate why, how and under which circumstances employees might positively respond to organizations' CSR initiatives in the controversial oil industry sector. Findings first support that perceived CSR (i. e. environmental CSR) positively relates to employees' OI which is known as an important antecedent of employees' outcomes (Riketta, J Vocat Behavior, 66(2):358, 2005). Furthermore, results highlighted that the relationship between perceived CSR and employees' OI is mediated by organizational trust. Finally, this study also revealed that some contingency factors such as employees' attributions of self-centred motives to their organization's investment in environmental issues can moderate the relationship between perceived CSR and organizational trust. Based on these findings, it is argued that CSR initiatives can support organizations' efforts to maintain a strong relationship with their employees, and gain their support even in a controversial industry sector. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility attributions; Organizational identification; Organizational trust; Perceived external prestige",,"de Roeck, K.; Louvain School of Management, Université catholique de Louvain, Place des Doyens, 1, 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; email: kenneth.deroeck@uclouvain.be",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

It contends that a utilitarian justification can be used to support the legal and regulated provision of goods and services in these areas, and the regulated and legal provision of these areas produces less harm than the real alternative-illegal and unregulated supply. Utilitarianism is concerned as much with harm minimisation as good maximisation, and both are equally important when it comes to maximising welfare (Bentham 1789, 1970; Mill [1863] 1964). Any adequate theory of CSR must, therefore, have the capacity to handle a business that minimises harm as well as those that more straightforwardly maximise good. In this paper we therefore attempt two tasks. First, we argue that the legal but regulated provision of products and services may be better from an overall utilitarian perspective than a situation in which these harmful or immoral goods and services are illegal but procurable via a black market. Porter and Kramer's (2006) strategic CSR framework is then presented to describe how firms in these controversial sectors can act in socially responsible ways. This model highlights the importance of firm strategy in selecting areas of socially responsible behaviours that can be acted upon by firms in each industry. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Controversial sectors; Corporate social responsibility; Harm minimisation; Regulation; Strategic CSR; Utilitarianism",,"Lindorff, M.; Department of Management, Monash University, 3800 Clayton, VIC, Australia; email: Margaret.Lindorff@monash.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

They seem committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices that are aimed at preventing or minimising the harm associated with their activities. Our empirical research employed a sample of 209 university student online gamblers, who took part in an online survey. Our findings suggest that the extent of online problem gambling is substantial and that it adversely impacts on the gambler's mental and physical health, social relationships and academic performance. Online problem gambling seems to be related to the time spent on the Internet and gambling online, parental/peer gambling and binge drinking. As our findings show that there are harmful repercussions associated with online gambling, we argue that companies in this controversial sector cannot reach the higher level of CSR achieved by other industries. Nevertheless, they can gain legitimacy on the basis of their CSR engagement at a transactional level, and so, by meeting their legal and ethical commitments and behaving with transparency and fairness, the integrity of the company can be ensured. We also argue that current failures in the implementation and control of CSR policies, the reliance on revenue from problem gamblers' losses, and controversial marketing activities appear to constitute the main obstacles in the prevention or minimisation of harm related to online gambling. As online gambling companies must be responsible for the harm related to their activities, we suggest that CSR policies should be fully implemented, monitored and clearly reported; all forms of advertising should be reduced substantially; and unfair or misleading promotional techniques should be banned. The industry should not rely on revenue from problem gamblers, nor should their behaviour be reinforced by marketing activities (i. e. rewards). We realise, however, that it is unrealistic to expect the online gambling industry to prioritise harm prevention over revenue maximisation. Policy makers and regulators, therefore, would need to become involved if the actions suggested above are to be undertaken. CSR is paramount to minimise harm and provide a healthier user experience in this business sector, but it also poses marketing dilemmas. We support a global collaborative approach for the online gambling industry, as harm related to gambling is a public health issue. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CSR and gambling addiction; CSR in controversial industries; CSR in online gambling; Marketing activities in the online gambling industry",,"Yani-de-Soriano, M.; Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University, Aberconway Building, Colum Drive, CF10 3EU, Cardiff, United Kingdom; email: yani-de-sorianom@cardiff.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Drawing specifically on the palm oil industry in Malaysia, this opinion piece therefore seeks to provoke debate on the relationship between rights and sustainability and whether emergent business and human rights regulatory frameworks grasp the complexity of business's impact on the right to food. Design/methodology/approach: The commentary draws on an analysis of disclosure made by all palm oil companies listed in the Malaysian stock exchange. The annual, corporate social responsibility reports and web pages for all companies as at June 2011 were reviewed. Each company's disclosures on human rights; sustainability and biofuel were analysed and related this to evidence of government investment. The primary objective in undertaking the content analysis was to explore whether and how the discourse of corporate accountability in the palm oil industry is evolving, specifically in relation to human rights and sustainability. Findings: The paper finds that there is little evidence that rights, the environment and biofuel are being connected at a policy or conceptual level in the palm oil sector in Malaysia. In the majority of disclosures, sustainability and rights appear to be substantively disconnected. In the main, the increase in demand for palm oil that will result from the growth of national biofuel targets is constructed as positive for business. This paper address the regulatory implications of the findings. Originality/value: This opinion piece contributes toward filling a significant gap in the literature on the inter-relationship between rights and sustainability.

A regulation framework for the banking sector should be characterised by transparency, responsibility and performance in several important areas. These areas are the global and European framework for corporate financial reporting, risk management, stockholder value creation, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and sustainable development. The regulation framework for the banking sector must also consider the fiscal and monetary environment in which a banking institution operates. The global rating system and the rating agencies will also have an important impact on any regulation framework for the banking sector.

We argue that the concept as used currently means everything and therefore adds nothing to the conceptual terrain of tourism trends and nomenclatures. We then introduce our own understanding of the concept arguing that while responsible tourism is linked to sustainability initiatives such as alternative tourism, ecotourism, ethical tourism, green tourism, soft tourism, pro-poor tourism, geo-tourism, integrated tourism, community-based tourism, etc it also demarcates an analytical realm of its own. We suggest that the practical use of the term in areas where it has been adopted (such as South Africa and Kerala for instance) suggests a rather restricted use. We identified this realm as the tourism sector-specific manifestation of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda. Following Flyvberg's [(2006). Five misunderstandings about case-study research. Qualitative Inquiry, 12(2), 219-245] call for exemplars and paradigmatic case studies to advance knowledge in a particular domain, the responsible tourism initiative in Kumarakon, Kerala, is presented. Discussion of the case study traces the particular governance context of Kerala and the position of tourism in the state economy. The responsible tourism initiatives at the state level and local level are then described highlighting the 'how' of the implementation and the impact that it has produced. Generic, non-prescriptive principles that could be said to be necessary in some form for the successful translation of responsible tourism principles to practices are then identified. Such an approach is contrasted with one that places faith in the voluntary adoption of 'responsible' practices by the private sector on its own. It is argued that responsible tourism can make a contribution to practice provided the conceptual terrain is delineated against other forms of tourism and if research within the terrain can unpack the particular forms of challenges that are thrown up by the delineation itself. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","corporate social responsibility; Kerala; Kumarakom; pro-poor tourism; responsible tourism; sustainable tourism",,"Chettiparamb, A.; School of Real Estate and Planning, University of Reading, Reading, United Kingdom; email: a.chettiparambilrajan@reading.ac.uk",,,19407963,,,,"English","J.

We develop and test two competing hypotheses of risk reduction and window dressing. Employing an extensive U. S. sample during the 1991-2010 period from controversial industry firms, such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and others, we find that CSR engagement inversely affects firm risk after controlling for various firm characteristics. To deal with endogeneity issue, we adopt a system equation approach and difference regressions and continue to find that CSR engagement of firms in controversial industry sectors negatively affects firm risk. To examine the premise that firm risk is more of an issue for controversial firms, we further examine the difference between non-controversial and controversial firm samples, and find that the effect of risk reduction through CSR engagement is more economically and statistically significant in controversial industry firms than in non-controversial industry firms. These findings support the risk-reduction hypothesis, but not the window-dressing hypothesis, and the notion that the top management of U. S. firms in controversial industries is, in general, risk averse and that their CSR engagement helps their risk management efforts. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Controversial industry sectors; Corporate social responsibility; Risk reduction; Window dressing",,"Jo, H.; Department of Finance, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0388, United States; email: hjo@scu.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research was conducted using focus groups, home tasks and workshops with 99 participants. The sample represented different groups of consumers in relation to their sustainability behaviour. Findings: Focus group participants had a limited awareness of the sustainability impacts of clothing. Where participants displayed pro-environmental behaviour, this was not necessarily intentional, but was largely a response to other influences. The respondents' maintenance and disposal of clothes were found to be influenced mainly by existing habits and routines, which usually take precedence over awareness of sustainable practice. The research indicated that consumers could be persuaded to change their behaviour in relation to sustainability by being encouraged and enabled to reflect more on their behaviour. Research limitations/implications: This study uses qualitative research and is limited to UK consumers. Future research in this field could incorporate quantitative methods or in-depth interviews. Academics could conduct further research and generate theories which apply to the sustainable consumption of clothing. Social implications: The findings have implications for retailers, academics and society. Retailers can develop and implement more sustainable policies and practices in relation to clothing production and consumption. There are wider implications for society and the environment in that retailers' practices can impact greatly on the sustainability of the planet's resources. Originality/value: This paper's originality lies in its assessment of the implications for retailers of consumers' views on the sustainable consumption of clothing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Choice editing; Clothing retailers; Consumer behaviour; Corporate social responsibility; Ethical consumerism; Fair trade; Focus groups; Qualitative research; Retail trade; Sustainability; Sustainable clothing",,"Goworek, H.; Business School, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom; email: helen.goworek@ntu.ac.uk",,,09590552,,,,"English","Int.

It may also help to provide a better understanding of the deteriorating reputations of firms and their leaders as perceived by society as a whole and of what might be required from leaders to strengthen the bonds with society. However, the precise manner in which leaders interpret and actually display responsibility is not altogether clear. This lack of clarity coincides with the varying perspectives of responsible leadership that occur in the literature, and it may contribute to the lack of systematic research on how such leadership may ultimately affect firm- and societal-level outcomes. Based on a qualitative analysis of 25 business leaders and entrepreneurs, we identify four orientations that leaders may use to demonstrate responsibility and implement corporate social responsibility. We show how these orientations vary according to the breadth of constituent group focus and the degree of accountability toward others.

We argue that the analytical vocabulary of governmentality makes it possible to address and problematize the indirect modes of power and governing that are prevalent in governmental approaches to CSR in general and in neoliberal modes of CSR governance in particular. Using EU and member states policy developments as an empirical backdrop, we provide a conceptual exploration of the prospects of applying governmentality to the study of the changing roles of government in CSR.

Research in organization studies on the topic is relatively new. Much of this research, however, is instrumental and managerialist in its focus on 'win-win' opportunities for business or its treatment of climate change as just another corporate social responsibility (CSR) exercise. In this paper, we suggest that climate change is not just an environmental problem requiring technical and managerial solutions; it is a political issue where a variety of organizations - state agencies, firms, industry associations, NGOs and multilateral organizations - engage in contestation as well as collaboration over the issue. We discuss the strategic, institutional and political economy dimensions of climate change and develop a socioeconomic regimes approach as a synthesis of these different theoretical perspectives. Given the urgency of the problem and the need for a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy, there is a pressing need for organization scholars to develop a better understanding of apathy and inertia in the face of the current crisis and to identify paths toward transformative change. The seven papers in this special issue address these areas of research and examine strategies, discourses, identities and practices in relation to climate change at multiple levels. © The Author(s) 2012.","carbon markets; climate change; political economy; socioeconomic regimes",,"Levy, D.

The emergence of a changing economic order has also made companies around the world seriously think about manufacturing and service sustainability. Global markets and operations have prompted companies to revisit their corporate, business and functional strategies in addition to focusing on outsourcing, virtual enterprise and supply chain management. Sustainability research on supply management has received limited attention. Nevertheless, considering the physically disbursed enterprise environment, supply management is critical for organizational competitiveness. Realizing the importance of sustainability in supply management, an attempt has been made to develop a theoretical framework and then to study the framework by means of an empirical study using perceptions and practices of selected French companies.

This value is expressed as Economic Value Added in conjunction with business science. Firstly, the theoretical analysis of separate parts of EVA is carried out and the influence of CSR on EVA is discussed. Mostly the neutral or negative effect is deducted and only one possibility of positive effect is identified, namely in the possibility of using CSR to increase the firm's revenues. This could be realized only on condition of customers' altruism. Only altruistic customers are willing to pay higher price to help some other people. The second part of the article describes and sums up our own experiment on altruism testing. We modified the standard one-round design of the Dictator Game in three ways: firstly, more rounds are played, secondly, we differentiate stable and unstable pairs of players and thirdly, we differentiate certain and uncertain ends of the game. According to the second and third points we have obtained four different experimental sessions. We used standard methods of experimental economics as regards the instructions and subjects' motivation. Each session was played twice so that one hundred and sixty students could participate on this experiment. More than three thousand figures were acquired. Then the three hypotheses of altruistic or egoistic behavior were tested. The ANOVA, the sign test, and the paired t-test were carried out. The egoistic behavior was confirmed twice and one time we could not confirm either egoistic or altruistic behavior of experimental subjects.

In addition, the impact of a balanced loan request for both CSP and innovation intensity was examined. An experiment was designed by manipulating the purpose of a loan request from a pharmaceutical company in order to create four alternative lending scenarios: (1) a full loan request for intensifying CSP activities; (2) a full loan request for increasing innovation intensity; (3) a loan request for a balanced investment in both CSP and innovation; and (4) a general purpose loan request (control group). The findings support that CSP investment is interpreted by loan officers as an indicator of superior corporate financial performance. However, no clear positive relationship between innovation intensity and lending decisions was found. These results are consistent with the view that lenders could be reluctant to fund innovation intensity initiatives because there may be a considerable time lag between this investment and its payoff. Contrary to expectations, a balanced loan request for both CSP and innovation was not interpreted by loan officers as the most favorable lending scenario for an innovative firm.","Corporate social performance; Financial performance; Innovation; Lending decisions",,"Guiral, A.; University of AlcalaSpain",,,10504753,,,,"English","Behav.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an empirical study of CSRD in 2009-2010, using content analysis, Cronbach's α, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality and a six point scale (0-5), mean, skewness, kurtosis, and Levene's, Kruskal-Wallis's and Mood's median tests for analysis and interpretation. Findings - CSRD shows less satisfactory social performance, mainly narrative, and varies significantly among items and themes. Community development, with a mean score of 14.30, is the most disclosed theme, followed by HR, with a score of 11.20. The human element is the center of social performance in India. More than equal focus should be given to the environment and to emissions, which impact the greater interests of the world. Some burning global issues like water usage, alternative sources of energy, product safety and innovation have not received adequate attention. Research limitations/implications - The study offers ample scope for the further studies as each and every theme and item considered in the model/index requires individual focus to serve the future generations of mankind. Longitudinal/transnational studies in the area of CSR could be carried out to set the scene for further studies. Practical implications - The paper recommends mandatory CSR norms leading to improved disclosure, the sharing of innovative knowledge, cost reductions and enhanced effectiveness in managing scarce resources. Originality/value - The paper evaluates social performance in the economic, social, religious environment and highlights the emerging philanthropic attitude. The paper improves an existing model by incorporating an emerging dimension, i.e. Emissions of carbon and other harmful gases.

Design/methodology/ approach - To achieve the objectives of this research, the perceptions of 142 Iranian employees were examined regarding the CSR practices of their respective organizations. The required data were collected using a questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to refine scale items and confirm the factorial structure of the scale applied. Descriptive statistics and a t-test were used to analyze the data. Findings - The paper unveils information about the current status of CSR in Iran from the perspective of employees, and shows that on average Iranian employees perceive their organizations to be committed to CSR, although the mean CSR scores were relatively low in all dimensions. Also, this research shows that while the four-factorial structure of Truker's CSR scale was confirmed in the Iranian context, some of the items had to be removed from the original scale when measuring CSR. Research limitations/implications - The relatively low mean on the categories of CSR among Iranian organizations from the perspective of employees indicates the infancy level of CSR among Iranian organizations and calls for further awareness among Iranian organizations and managers about the issue of CSR. This research also shows that researchers need to be cautious when using CSR scales that have been developed in Western or European contexts to measure social responsibility activities of organizations in culturally different contexts such as the Middle East. A major limitation of this research pertains to sample size, which limits the generalizability of the findings to the whole country. Practical implications - This research indicates the infancy level of CSR among Iranian organizations and calls for further engagement of Iranian organizations in social initiatives and community outreach endeavors.

Porter and Kramer have proposed a new interpretation of this relationship based on the mutual dependence that exists between corporations and society. Trying to put into practice the shared value principle, for-profit companies engaging in strategic CSR have chosen to implement new hybrid business models. These models include the social business model and the inclusive business model. The purpose of the paper is to understand which characteristics distinguish social and inclusive business models and what kind of benefits and risks (for companies and for communities) are connected to each model. Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify the features of the inclusive business and social business models and the benefits and risks associated with these models, ten case studies were analyzed. Analysis of the business models was based on a theoretical framework developed through the analysis of the literature. Findings - The findings of the research suggest two main conclusions. First, social and inclusive business models are similar in partner networks, use of knowledge and value chain, in the development of innovative distribution models (except for the cases in which the market considered is not in an emerging country) and in terms of social benefit. Second, the social and inclusive business models are different in terms of value proposition, governance systems, profits management model, social risks and economic profit equation. Research limitations/ implications - The first limitation is that the case study analysis is based on documentary materials; for further investigation it might be useful to develop in-depth interviews with key figures involved in the implementation of business models. Even though this descriptive study has allowed a first important step in taking a comparative analysis between the two business models, further research should strive to extend the analysis to all the hybrid business models that are being developed with the aim of creating shared value. Practical implications - The final propositions allow entrepreneurs and managers to better understand the characteristics of business models. Moreover, the theoretical framework is a conceptual instrument that is useful in analyzing and evaluating alternative ways to develop new business models - based on the creating shared value principle - in developing markets. Originality/value - The paper focuses on comparing the characteristics of the social versus inclusive business models. Studies that compare business models in the social venturing space are limited. Moreover, the study addresses the similarity and differences between the two business models rather than focusing on the two models separately as the previous researches have done. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business model; Corporate social responsibility; Developing countries; Inclusive business; Modelling; Social business",,"Michelini, L.; LUMSA University, Rome, Italy; email: l.michelini@gmail.com",,,17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Findings - The brand social responsibility scale tested in this research was more focused on a brand's trustworthiness, awareness, and the brand's philanthropic activities from a consumer's perspective.

In the current study, the paper focuses on corporate social responsibility (CSR) appeals in which the company promises to donate a portion of the purchase price to a charitable cause and requests a matching donation from the customer. More specifically, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of status, proximity to CSR, and empathy towards the cause on consumers' willingness to donate money to a charity. Design/methodology/approach: The study used written scenarios and a 2×2×2 between subjects quasi experimental design to test the hypotheses. The authors predicted that status would interact with empathy and proximity of the cause to influence customers' donation behavior. Findings: The results supported these predictions. Status seeking individuals exhibited higher levels of prosocial behaviors when the cause was a national one, particularly when the individual felt empathy towards the distant cause. Conversely, empathy feelings had a positive impact donation intent when the cause was a local one and status seeking was not activated. Originality/value: The results of this study have significant implications for marketers and managers who are considering launching a CSR program.

Design/methodology/approach: Cultural-historical activity theory is applied, specifically the historical tool-mediated activity, concept formation and the zone of proximal development. A dynamic hierarchy of conceptualizations forms the framework for expansive learning efforts. Data were gathered by ethnographic and development interventionist methods from a distributed engineering design project. Findings: The paper finds that, historically, multi-layered conceptualizations of work face developmental challenges in globalizing work. Expansive learning efforts enhance the emergent learning practices when orienting global participants to motivating ""why"" and ""where-to"" conceptualizations. In order to turn emergent practices into sustainable learning practices, material representations need to be created to mediate the bottom-up and top-down conceptualizations at the interfaces of distributed work. Research limitations/implications: Emergent learning practices are studied longitudinally through concrete work in transformation. The learning approach emphasizes developmental interventions at global workplaces. Practical implications: Expansive learning efforts at different levels of conceptualization, may be supported by tools that mediate and sustain emergent learning practices.

Design/methodology/approach: As a theoretical framework we use the resource based view theory and the institutional theory. For the empirical analysis we used the panel data technique to estimate our models, the sample is composed of 257 US firms and covers a four-year period from 2004 to 2007. Findings: The results of this research demonstrates that R&D with the moderation of innovation with high social benefits will produce a greater positive effect on corporate reputation than R&D by itself, since R&D activities can produce innovations that do not produce any social benefit which may not be perceived by stakeholders. Practical implications: Innovative firms should focus their efforts on identifying opportunities in their R&D processes to initiate related corporate social responsibility activities that could help them build a good reputation, which in the long run can give them a competitive advantage and profitable results.Originality/value: Recently several studies have demonstrated that R&D is related with corporate social responsibility and that it is important to include both variables when studying financial performance.

Design/methodology/approach: In the absence of empirical work linking internal marketing efforts in organizations and employee engagement in corporate responsibility issues, a conceptual approach based on literature review is carried out to determine the existing possibilities provided by internal marketing to enhance corporate responsibility. Findings: Reflexion from the extant literature indicates that, because employee engagement matters, internal responsibility should be put first. The internal marketing umbrella, including ""selling internally"" the idea of responsibility, facilitating internal communication, enhancing corporate volunteering or the possibility to become a social intrapreneur, could help to align employees' needs with corporate responsibility goals. Practical implications: The results suggest that managers must ensure that internal aspects of management, such as internal communication and employee commitment are taken into account in order to get success in corporate responsibility issues. Managers need to be more proactive trying to introduce the marketing function in human capital issues. Understanding employees' wants and needs and selling internally responsibility goals would make external efforts in developing a responsible strategy much more likely to succeed. Originality/value: Reflecting the literature which highlights the importance of internal marketing, we pay particular attention to their role on promoting corporate responsibility internally. The results indicate that while organizations strive to achieve corporate responsibility goals, it is expected that effectiveness will be greater among organizations using internal marketing tools for this purpose.

An exploratory case study of the social responsibility partnership programme at the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has been conducted. The case study draws on interview data and documentary sources of evidence gathered from UEFA and the six partner organisations that comprise its CSR portfolio. The conceptual model identifies three stages of the implementation process (selection, design, management), with partnership evaluation being an ongoing process during all three. The latter consists of two elements, namely project and process evaluation. A key finding is the lack of process evaluation due to a high degree of inter-personal trust. The conceptual model adds to the growing body of research on the implementation of social partnerships and CSR.

This article is not concerned with the design details or the evidence base of the proposed scheme, but rather with the fundamental criticism that a mandatory pre-commitment policy is an unacceptable interference with the liberty of the individual, and of organizations. It is argued that the concept of paternalism is a useful lens with which to study the interactions between business and society on this issue. It is contended that the benefits of a pre-commitment system to problem gamblers and society are socially and economically significant, and the cost to recreational gamblers, particularly the cost in terms of interference with the liberty of the individual, is minimal. Pre-commitment also requires gambling businesses to act in a more socially responsible manner.

Match attendance equates with financial return; patently it is a preoccupation of senior management. Metrics of brand performance need be up to date, and include contemporary issues such as corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a reflection of consumer expectations. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology aims to evaluate consumers' perceptions and purchase behaviours. A sample survey of consumers' brand evaluations has been collected and factor and regression analyses have been employed. Findings: Recent models based on Keller's conceptual approach have not emphasized the evolution of societal concerns. Brand management in the football industry has to change to meet customer expectations better. Practical implications: This research demonstrates that professional football clubs may be different from other businesses. The research method used enables the evaluation of customer-based brand equity. Findings suggest clubs' involvement in community activities influences brand image and customer behaviour. The sport entertainment industry requires a specific type of brand management and customer perceived ethicality has to be an integral part of the approach. Originality/value: Brand theories tend to stem from marketing and they are inclined to emphasize the same kind of product-oriented concerns. However, customers expect more than watching an exciting game in a pleasant environment; they are affected by clubs' community involvement which impacts on the affect towards the brand. This is demonstrated through purchase behaviours of spectators. This research determines and evaluates these issues for the cases of two professional football clubs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Consumer perceived ethicality; Corporate social responsibility; Customer-based brand equity; Football; Football club; Sport entertainment; Sports",,"Blumrodt, J.; Department of Management and Organization, ESC Rennes School of Business, Rennes, France; email: jens.blumrodt@esc-rennes.fr",,,07363761,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: Having constructed a theoretical framework incorporating CSR and corporate identity literature, the paper draws on a discourse perspective to analyse the legitimation strategies applied by a single organisation storying its CSR involvement. The strategies are subsequently addressed in relation to isomorphic discourses of legitimacy. Findings: The analysis supports the view that corporate self-storying of CSR balances between the needs for differentiation and conformity. Organisations thus navigate between the value associated with compliance with societal norms and expectations and the value of promoting organisational uniqueness. Research limitations/implications: Institutional processes result in isomorphic organisational practices also in relation to legitimacy reflected in the storying of CSR involvement. However, this study implies that isomorphism also offers organisations opportunities to stand out. Originality/value: The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, it articulates a framework for addressing CSR communication as a form of corporate self-storying that is embedded in a differentiation/conformity paradox. Second, it explores how an organisation's extended responsibility - i.e. responsibility for supplier practices - is storied in a way that suggests that addressing legitimacy is a question of navigating the paradox. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Conformity; Corporate communications; Corporate self-storying; Corporate social responsibility; Differentiation; Legitimacy; Storytelling",,"Johansen, T.

However, in areas of limited statehood, where state actors are too weak to effectively set and enforce collectively binding rules, profit-driven MNCs confront various dilemmas with respect to costly CSR standards. The lack of a credible regulatory threat by state agencies is therefore often associated with the exploitation of resources and people by MNCs, rather than with business' social conduct. However, in this paper we argue that there are alternatives to the ""shadow of hierarchy"" that induce MNCs to adopt and implement CSR policies that contribute to governance in areas of limited statehood. We then discuss that in certain areas such functional equivalents still depend on some state intervention to be effective, in particular when firms are immune to reputational concerns and in complex-task areas that require the involvement of several actors in the provision of collective goods. Finally, we discuss the ""dark side"" of the state and show that the state can also have negative effects on the CSR engagement of MNCs. We illustrate the different ways in which statehood and the absence thereof affect CSR activities of MNCs in South Africa and conclude with some considerations on the conditions under which statehood exerts these effects.",,,"Börzel, T.A.; Freie Universität Berlin, Ihnestraße 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; email: tanja.boerzel@fu-berlin.de",,,13695258,,,,"English","Bus.

Drawing on the extant literature, the authors identify four characteristics contended by academicians as peculiarities of SMEs' approach to CSR: the intrinsic relationship between CSR and corporate strategy motivated by the need to continuously dialogue with stakeholders; the centrality of the entrepreneur's ethos in CSR decisions; the coexistence and the cross-effect of economically instrumental and ethically motivated CSR policies; and the finalization of CSR initiatives to specific firm growth objectives. These four peculiarities are explored in the case of an Italian medium-sized company operating in the furniture industry. The outcomes show how the four peculiarities are salient in analyzing the CSR approach by the company and suggest areas for further research aimed at developing a thorough theory of CSR in SMEs.

We identify three channels through which exogenous and endogenous CSR are developed: employees with work experience in multinational enterprises (MNEs) (leading to exogenous CSR), employees with CSR knowledge (leading to exogenous CSR) and employees with experience of the socialist system (leading to endogenous CSR). Furthermore, we argue that the interactions between these channels lead to hybrid CSR in transition economies. We use a questionnaire-based survey with employees of domestic and MNEs in Romania and we conduct regression analysis. We find that employees with work experience in MNEs act as channels for exogenous CSR, while employees with experience of the socialist system act as channels for endogenous CSR. Furthermore, employees with experience of the socialist system and CSR knowledge or work experience in an MNE act as channels for hybrid CSR in transition economies.

This study demonstrates that the impact of price differentials on counterfeit purchases varies according to the perceived corporate citizenship (PCC) image of the original brand. When consumers perceive the legitimate brand to be high in corporate citizenship (high PCC), the extent of the price differential does not affect consumers' purchase intentions toward the counterfeit. However, when the legitimate brand has a negative image (low PCC), higher price differentials trigger significantly greater intentions to purchase the counterfeit product. This moral profiteering effect indicates that consumers are more likely to purchase counterfeits when they have both economic and moral justifications for their unethical actions.

In functional terms, GFAs are a commitment to include global labor standards with respect to human resource management as part of this broader turn to CR. But to what extent are these intentions and goals actually realized? Are corporations able and willing to implement GFAs in a joint effort together with the unions across a vastly diverse range of institutional settings and national arrangements? And do GFAs have an influence on core elements of a company's business policy decisions? Drawing on the insights from an interdisciplinary and multinational project, this paper uses four case studies to explore the conditions and variations in GFA implementation in the USA. Although we observe, as have others before us, that key matters of business strategy such as investments, acquisitions, restructuring, or relocation are more centralized than corporate policies on labor relations, we provide some evidence that the implementation of GFAs can be moved forward by a confluence of external actor involvement and of corporate strategies motivated by a desire to streamline HRM practices (that include the goals covered by GFAs in their core business practices). This finding of the influence of external actor voice in implementation processes may also have broader explanatory power with respect to CR initiatives in general. And in theoretical terms it allows us to explore the interplay between macro structural explanations like the Varieties of Capitalism approach, and the strategic ""micro-political"" explanations.

Data were collected from members of 28 SD advisory committees/representative organizations (a 57% response rate) and resulted in a usable dataset of 53 SD projects. Results of analysis indicate that government, business, and civil society SD project members do not perceive major differences between partnership characteristics and perceived project performance but do in relation to network behavior. Multiple regression analysis suggests that trust contributes towards perceived project performance, as do the network behavior characteristics of private sector and civil society group actors; however, for the latter group, network behavior is negatively correlated with project performance.

The images of humanitarian organisations distributing food and medicines under the protection of military forces, or aid workers and military working together to construct refugee camps, set up field hospitals, provide emergency water and sanitation, has become more frequent. The media coverage from natural and man-made disasters in recent years, has heightened the expectation of a smooth interaction between humanitarian organisations and military forces. Due to fundamental differences between international military forces, humanitarian and development organisations (in terms of the principles and doctrines guiding their work, their agendas, operating styles, and roles), the area of civil military coordination in disaster relief has proven to be more difficult than other interagency relationships. In order to address this, the authors outline the usage of systems analysis and design technique (SADT) to explain how a more effective coordination of humanitarian operations by military and civilian organisations involved in disaster relief can be achieved across the range of humanitarian aid lifecycle phases. Furthermore the authors provide an empirical comparison of military and humanitarian organisation partnership evaluation criteria for (CIMIC). Finally, the authors then develop and present how the SADT approach can inform the development of a systems dynamics model using systems archetypes (SA) to describe the rich interactions between stakeholders and involved components.

We view urban areas as dynamic sociocultural systems, meaning that effectively and dynamically understanding and addressing their challenges means confronting the full complexity of factors that interact to make up the system. More precisely, we understand these systems to be complex service systems, arrangements of multiple entities and stakeholders that interact to co-create value. Decision makers of urban centers face the design problem of arranging the entities so that the most mutual value emerges from their interactions. To analyze and understand such complex systems, we suggest a new approach to service system analysis based on model composition to design and evaluate stakeholder relationships through what-if scenarios. Applied to the intriguing real-world scenario of crime and perceptions of crime in the London Borough of Sutton, we show how service system analysis - analyzing value constellations to find opportunities for reconfiguring roles and relationships that unlock value - can be applied to a sociocultural service system by focusing on the complex relationship among components that can influence complex questions, such as safety and quality-of-community.

Results from 136 SMEs in the manufacturing industry demonstrate that the characteristic of compatibility has a strong and positive influence on the willingness of SMEs to engage in CSR, which means not only that managers' personal values and morality and managers' support are CSR drivers, but also that current corporate culture consistent with CSR and the corporate image fitting well with the concept of CSR will encourage higher take-up of CSR. Conversely, complexity has a negative impact, which means that the social compliance costs, time, and lack of guidance or benchmarks are regarded as a barrier for SMEs to implement CSR. The educational levels of owner-top managers have a marked effect on CSR initiatives; the impact is greatest from managers with graduate level degrees. Due to the size effect among SMEs, the annual revenue is positively associated with the willingness of SMEs to engage in CSR.

Further, from a person-organization fit perspective, we examine whether applicants are attracted to organizations whose corporate social responsibility (CSR) reflects their differences in ethical predispositions (i. e., utilitarianism and formalism) and Machiavellianism. Using factorial design, we created scenarios manipulating CSR and pay level. Participants read each scenario and answered questions about their attraction to the organization depicted in the scenario. We found that each aspect of CSR had an independent relationship with organizational attraction and the probability of accepting a job offer. Participants combined information from each type of CSR in an interactive, configural manner. Applicants with different ethical predispositions and Machiavellianism personality were affected by CSR to different extents. Understanding how job applicants evaluate CSR information may give managers an opportunity to influence applicant attraction. Further, our study shows that organizations may be able to maximize the utility of their CSR investments by selectively conveying CSR information in recruitment brochures that are attractive to their ideal applicants.

A tipping point in an interview serves to reveal the ambiguities of the position adopted and the difficulties of expressing oneself in a different language.

We aim to verify whether firms with higher CSR disclosure ratings enjoy significantly lower costs of equity capital, after controlling for the well-known Fama and French risk factors (i.e. beta, market-to-book, and size). Consistent with our main hypothesis, we find a significant negative relationship between CSR disclosure ratings and the cost of equity capital. We also obtain that the negative relationship between CSR reporting quality and the cost of equity capital is more pronounced for those firms operating in environmentally sensitive industries. Our findings contribute to the debate on whether CSR activities are value-enhancing or value-neutral by showing that improved CSR can enhance firm value by reducing the firm's cost of equity capital. This implies that CSR reporting is a part of a firm's communication tools in order to decrease information asymmetries between managers and investors. In other words, mandatory social responsibility reporting is called for in order to produce a more precise valuation of a firm. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Corporate social responsibility; Cost of equity capital; Spain; Sustainable investing",,"Reverte, C.; Technical University of Cartagena, C/Real 3, Cartagena E-30201, Spain; email: Carmelo.Reverte@upct.es",,,15353958,,,,"English","Corp.

To explore national institutions, the paper compares CSR reporting in France and Australia characterized respectively as state-led market economies (SLMEs) and liberal market economies (LMEs). Comparisons are also made between high-risk and low-risk industries. The interaction between the two main variables is also analyzed. Research Findings/Insights: Using corporate published data from a sample of 220 Australian and French companies in 2009, the research finds that CSR reporting is stronger and CSR practices more transparent in France compared to Australia. CSR reporting is also stronger in high-risk industries than in low-risk industries. It also found that industry characteristics override the influence of national institutions in high-risk industries. However, these conclusions vary depending on the sub-categories of CSR reporting and the implicit versus explicit form of this type of communication. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study develops a new model of CSR reporting using 99 items. It provides empirical support for the institutional perspective for understanding differences in reporting whilst demonstrating the interaction between industry risk characteristics and national institutions. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study offers insights to policy makers interested in promoting CSR accountability and transparency. It especially raises the importance of regulation to develop corporate reporting practices. It also provides insights to managers to identify relevant CSR practices within their country/industries and the different communication strategies that they can adopt in responding to institutional pressures. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Corporate Governance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Industry Risk; National Institutions; Reporting",,"Young, S.; La Trobe Business School, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC 3218, Australia; email: s.h.young@latrobe.edu.au",,,09648410,,,,"English","Corp.

This paper makes two contributions to addressing this lacuna. Applying a range of influential normative theories of ethics, it first offers an ethical evaluation of tax havens. Second, the paper examines what use large firms that are headquartered in two OFCs-Bermuda and the Cayman Islands-make of formal CSR tools. The emerging duplicity in tax haven-based companies professing social responsibility highlights once more the political nature of CSR, where at least some firms and/or industries can successfully limit government power to enact regulation as well as shape the discourse around CSR. The study of CSR in OFC-based firms thus calls into question the usefulness of the often quoted definition of CSR as going beyond the law. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bermuda; Business ethics; Cayman Islands; Codes of conduct; Corporate social responsibility; Offshore finance centres; Tax havens",,"Preuss, L.; School of Management, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham Hill, Egham, Surrey TW20 0EX, United Kingdom; email: Lutz.Preuss@rhul.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

However, the literature is not conclusive on this point. This study adopts a new perspective, considering cause-brand fit as a moderator variable rather than a direct antecedent to consumer evaluations of CrM. Thus, the main objective of this research is to examine the moderator role of cause-brand fit in the influence of two corporate associations elicited in CrM (corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate ability (CA) associations) on brand attitude and two behavioural consumer responses (purchase intent and support to non-profit organisation (NPO)). For this, a theoretical model is proposed, and it is estimated with a sample of 595 Spanish consumers of insurance and personal hygiene and toiletries products. Results show that when consumers perceive high social cause-brand fit, the positive influence of CSR associations on the formation of brand attitude is amplified. However, when cause-brand fit is low, brand attitude is formed via CA associations. Finally, consumer behavioural responses in favour of the brand (i.e. purchase intent) and social cause (i.e. support to NPO) are reinforced in a context of high cause-brand perceived fit. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","brand attitude; cause-brand fit; cause-related marketing; corporate ability associations; corporate social responsibility associations; purchase intent",,"Currás-Pérez, R.; Department of Marketing, University of Valencia, Av.

The extant literature has identified the importance of the fit between the organization and the nature of the cause in influencing corporate image, as well as the influence of a connection between the cause and consumer preferences on brand attitudes and brand choice. However, prior research has not addressed which cause composition most appeals to consumers or the impact of cause choice on corporate image. A between-subjects field experiment in the Netherlands examines the influence of three core cause attributes-cause type, cause scope, and cause acuteness-on consumers' perceptions of corporate image. Furthermore, this experiment examines the extent to which consumer identification with the cause mediates the influence of the cause attributes on corporate image. The findings indicate that identification with the cause leads to more positive evaluations of marketing campaigns for cause type and cause scope. Also, however, our results uncover a negative direct relationship between cause scope and corporate image. Cause acuteness is only marginally influential in corporate image perceptions. By proposing and testing a comprehensive model of the influence of cause attributes on corporate image in cause-related marketing, this article provides important implications and suggests avenues for further research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cause acuteness; Cause scope; Cause type; Cause-related marketing; Consumer preferences; Corporate image; Corporate social responsibility; Experiment",,"Lindgreen, A.; Cardiff Business School, The University of Cardiff, Aberconway Building, Colum Drive, Cardiff CF10 3EU, United Kingdom; email: LindgreenA@cardiff.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

I then examine the scope of the top management journals, showing how their empirical and descriptive focus leaves little room for ethics, which is an essentially conceptual and prescriptive discipline.

Applying advanced financial models to a uniquely constructed panel dataset, we demonstrate that a significant overall CSP-CFP relationship exists and that this relationship is, in part, conditioned on firms' industry-specific context. To accommodate the estimation of time-invariant industry and industry-interaction effects, we estimate linear mixed models in our test of the CSP-CFP relationship. Our results show both a significant overall CSP effect as well as significant industry effects between CSP and CFP. In conflict with expectations, the unweighted average effect of CSP on CFP is negative. Our industry analysis, however, shows that in over 17% of the industries in our sample, the effect of CSP on CFP for socially responsible firms is positive. We also examine the multidimensional nature of the CSP construct in an industry context by exploring the CSP dimension-industry nexus and identify dimensions of social performance that are associated with either better or worse financial performance. Our results confirm the existence of disparate CSP dimension-industry effects on CFP, thus our results provide important and actionable information to decision makers considering whether and how to commit corporate resources to social performance. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate financial performance; Corporate social performance; Linear mixed model; Panel data analysis; Residual income model",,"Roberts, J.

Three ways to 'sense' change are compared: following trends, issues and events; picking up signals from stakeholders; and adjusting to sustainable development as a specific definition of 'progress'. The paper discusses the merits and limits of each approach. Conclusions are drawn in terms of implications for managing CR. Moreover, the cybernetic model is held to provide for a theory of CR that is more in line with the multi-disciplinary nature of practice than is found in ideas that derive from business ethics or stakeholder theory.

The article uses Clegg's ideas of 'circuits of power' to develop an analytical framework and employs a qualitative, case study approach based on a wide range of documents and media reports in the public domain. It addresses the processes of public management in the Barangaroo development, focusing on strategic agenda setting and leadership; organizing by rules; contract relations; no-cost-to government policy; organizing by precedent, especially those embedded in institutional responsibilities and responses; and stakeholder management. It demonstrates that at each stage in the process these have been characterized less by the rhetoric of public management and more by a disorganization of this rhetoric by a complex politics flowing through distinct circuits of power.

Developing countries' firms, however, are still in the early stage of their awareness and integration of CSR activities within their corporate policies and strategies. The present exploratory study utilizes a sample of Saudi Arabian firms' managers to assess the extent of their awareness of CSR, its role within their organizations, the extent of CSR integration in their corporate policies, and the nature and scope of these firms' CSR activities.

To be socially responsible means, beyond compliance with applicable regulations, in a rigorous and continuous manner, a voluntary and continual concern of the company with investments in human capital, in environment management, and stakeholders' relationship management. The paper aims to investigate multiple conceptions and definitions of social responsibility and social entrepreneurship using an extensive review of the recent specialized literature. Also, to get a clear understanding of the meanings of the two concepts, various good practices of organizations demonstrating social responsibility have been researched, using information available on their web pages and other specialized sites. The paper explains the determinants that influence the companies' socially responsible behavior and the dimensions of social responsibility. The social entrepreneurship term is also examined through the perspective of the criteria against which the social impact of the company is assessed. Furthermore, the similarities and differences between the two concepts are inquired, as well as the steps that a socially responsible company is to take to become a social entrepreneurial organization. The paper suggests that a company which integrates social and environment objectives into its key processes and its interaction with stakeholders is more likely to be more competitive on the market and to contribute successfully to the sustainable socio-economic growth of the local community in which it operates.","Companies; Social entrepreneurial organization; Social entrepreneurship; Social responsibility; Social value",,"Pǎunescu, C.; Bucharest University of Economic Studies, Faculty of Business AdministrationRomania; email: carmen.paunescu@fabiz.ase.ro",,,15822559,,,,"English","Qual.

Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical underpinnings for the research are drawn from existent literature on CSR. A total of 120 questionnaires were collected, 68 percent of which were filled in online, the rest were answered manually by the respondents. Findings - The results suggest that environmental friendliness, legal responsibility and stewardship principle are considered to be very important in Kazakhstan. The attitudes towards economic responsibility are significantly affected by age and working experience. The application of Carroll's Pyramid of CSR identified that the hierarchy of responsibilities in Kazakhstan exists in the following order: legal, ethical, economic, and philanthropic. The primary payback of CSR is improved company image and reputation.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a narrative-inductive approach to make important contributions to the corporate social responsibility- organizational effectiveness literature. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview, and analyzed using qualitative analysis strategies. Findings - The study reports a profound perceived usefulness of ethics and social responsibility for business in the insurance industry in Nigeria. Furthermore, the study presents evidence that indicates that consciousness about the role of ethics and social responsibility in organizational effectiveness in this context is low, but, nevertheless suggests a positive posture towards the constructs. This positive posture seems to have been driven by the negative image of the industry and the need to remedy the situation. It suggests that this can be achieved through a show of genuine concern for the needs of the consumers, and the need to reinforce their trust and confidence in insurance as a loss mitigating mechanism. Practical implications - While shareholders' value maximization was shown as one of the considerations for ethical and social responsible behavior compromise, findings from the study also suggest that stakeholders' value maximization would be an effective consideration for the industry to improve the present low market penetration. The paper draws out the need to amend short-term goals for long-term goals by sacrificing short-term profits for long-term profits and survival.

The article is thus positioned within a growing stream of literature critical of BoP ideas, but it goes further than existing critiques by arguing that the current BoP discourse serves an important ideological function for global capital, specifically producing a discursive depoliticization of its corporate interventions in the lives of the world's poor. We argue that the poverty-reduction outcome of a BoP venture is contingent on its practice on the ground, which will inevitably be shaped by local and global power relations. In particular, we point to three cultural-political issues overlooked by the BoP discourse, which are vital in understanding the practice of business ventures at the BoP: adverse power relationships within poor communities; social-epistemological hierarchies between the poor and outsiders who administer poverty-reduction interventions; and local vulnerabilities induced by global currents in products, services, information and ideologies. © The Author(s) 2011.","Base of the Pyramid; corporate social responsibility; development; participation; poverty reduction; TNCs",,"Arora, S.; School of Innovation Sciences, Eindhoven University of Technology, IPO 2.20, PO Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; email: s.arora@tue.nl",,,13505084,,,,"English","Organization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864386413

Focusing on the connections between these activities and corporate strategy, the paper seeks to investigate the main trends in corporate philanthropy development over the period 2007-2010, assuming that corporate philanthropy is an integral part of corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical framework is based on the recognition of ""strategic"" philanthropy as a part as well as the main trend in current philanthropic activities of leading companies. The analysis as such is settled on survey data collected from participants in the national ""Corporate Philanthropy Leaders"" award competition conducted by the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti, PwC, and the non-profit grant-making organization ""Donors Forum"" from 2008 to 2011. Findings: The results testify to strengthening connections between corporate philanthropy and corporate strategy, enhancing the strategic nature of philanthropy as such. Here the responding companies significantly diversified the directions of their philanthropic activities, whereas the distribution of corporate philanthropy by form showed a high stability that was practically unaffected by the economic crisis of 2008-2009. A common practice is the professionalization of managing corporate philanthropy, with a growing role for CSR departments. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on the activities of leading Russian companies participating in the national ""Corporate Philanthropy Leaders"" award competition, thereby restricting the analysis of non-participants. Moreover, the evolution of competition surveys and their methodology as well as relatively low repetition of participants also restrict the degree of generalization. Future research could be based on the findings of this study to create hypotheses to be tested on a broader sample of Russian companies. Originality/value: The majority of studies of corporate philanthropy in Russia are still covering the necessity of corporate philanthropy for resolving societal problems and describing particular ""best practice"" cases rather than analyzing the relation of corporate philanthropy to the whole system of CSP and its strategic applications. This study aims to address this gap by focusing on corporate philanthropy leaders as a first step to broad nationwide research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate philanthropy; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate strategy; Russia; Social development",,"Blagov, Y.; PWC Center for Corporate Social Responsibility, St Petersburg University Graduate School of Management, St Petersburg, Russian Federation; email: blagov@gsom.pu.ru",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

Empirical evidence shows that corporations struggle with managing their progressive societal involvement in a global and transparent marketplace. The field of organization development (OD) has so far mostly neglected to acknowledge these struggles, despite being ideally positioned for developing the missing corporate citizenship (CC) management capacity of corporations. This is problematic, as OD fails to address a problem that has detrimental effects on both corporate functioning and society, therewith also defaulting on an opportunity to position itself as continuously relevant in the future. The Solution. This article offers solutions to these problems by argumentatively aligning OD and CC. Thereby, the article discusses how the field of OD can start tackling the issue of CC.

The objective is to motivate business and national leaders to do so with sustainability mindsets and strategic leadership. The pre-conditions that will accelerate the ""motivation"" to do so are identified, as are interventions identified. The sphere of influence business and national leaders have to impact sustainable globalization is identified. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is to focus on information in the public domain that outlines the ""real"" challenges faced by nations and business as they consider the need for sustainability and key issues such as ""poverty and climate change"", which if not addressed could have detrimental strategic implications for the planet, business and nations. The changes that have taken place since 1982 when global leaders signed up to Agenda 21 and the relatively insignificant movement that has occurred to date is outlined to strengthen the case for quantum leaps in the short to medium term. The strategic framework recommended is one that combines the need for organizations to set a new gold standard for ""corporate responsibility"", which is a ""commitment to sustainable business"" followed by a commitment to differentiating the business or nation on a sustainability paradigm. This is presented as means to embedding sustainability in strategy in the form of the concept of ""strategic corporate sustainability"". The concept of strategic corporate sustainability is presented as a two-step approach that initially requires both national and corporate leaders to commit to the need for sustainability by developing triple bottom line strategies. This is followed by the need to embed sustainability strategy as the corporate strategy that differentiates the nation and the business, strategically setting it apart from those that have not done so. This is presented as one of the ways to move forward to achieve the goal of sustainable globalization. Findings: The key findings from information in the public domain of nations and business that have embedded a sustainability policy and are demonstrating that enlightened leaders who have sustainability mindsets as a primary requirement for the future are presented with the examples of General Electric and Unilever. The process of nations embedding sustainability policy, which in turn motivates business to strive for sustainable business, which finally leads to sustainable consumption, is presented in a sequential manner. Originality/value: The originality of the paper is in the form of the concept of strategic corporate sustainability, which was first mooted in 2008 at Cambridge University and has since been accepted as a key subject and elective for MBA and AMP programs between 2008 and 2012 at many business schools, confirming both its validity and its originality. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Strategic corporate sustainability; Strategic national sustainability; Sustainable business; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable development; Sustainable globalization; Sustainable policy",,"Fernando, R.; Malaysia Blue Ocean Strategy Institute, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; email: ravi@ceylonam.com",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

The context is Nigeria and its development challenges contrasted with the Nigerian oil industry, which dominates the Nigerian economy as the core resource. It examines the country's attempt to reconnect the oil industry business with development through the Nigerian Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). Design/methodology/approach: This paper primarily examines the attempt to re-orient the oil industry in Nigeria through the Nigerian PIB. It adopts a conceptual approach analyzing the current debates and delays surrounding the bill in line with themes of human development and corporate social responsibility (CSR). It therefore examines and questions the linkages between business, development, law and governance. Findings: The main findings suggest that development is best viewed in context of the needs of the relevant country and therefore if corporations through CSR are to engage more meaningfully with the developmental agenda then it must move beyond ""self-interested"" models of CSR and engage meaningfully and fairly with facilitative frameworks in the ""local"" contexts, including the use of law. Originality/value: This paper is an exploratory discussion that examines the potential and limitations of linking business to development agendas in an ongoing context. This is because the Nigerian Petroleum Industry Bill, originally drafted in 2008, has not yet passed into law at the end of 2011.

The paper views CSR as an endogenous motivation for corporate social behaviour. The intended contributions of this paper are twofold. On the one hand, the authors intend to collect first-hand data to understand the current status of Chinese managers' cognitions of CSR. On the other hand the paper intends to analyse the differences which exist in managers' cognitions on CSR among different kinds of firms in a Chinese context. Design/methodology/approach: A random survey was conducted among 157 businessmen using the force-choice questionnaire, based on the four-part construct proposed by Carroll. The confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to test the construct validity of Carroll's conceptual model with the data sample drawn from Chinese situation. Then correlation, six pairwise t-tests and MANOVA test were conducted for the purpose of this study. Findings: Chinese managers' cognition of CSR is found to be consistent with the four-component construct. A relatively strong preference toward economic component has been examined. The results present a significant negative correlation between economic cognition and all three of its non-economic counterparts. No significant cognitive differences have been verified between firms with different characteristics. Research limitations/implications: This paper initially examined the cognition of Chinese managers toward CSR. Chinese managers are viewed as having an important role in decision making on social issues. However, how to promote the managers' cognition of CSR is needed for future research which will also examine the internal driving mechanism of CSR.

Under certain assumptions, it is concluded that (1) there exists a mutual incentive between their CSR behavior, whereby a win-win performance in terms of both CSR and profitability is achieved as long as exogenous parameters exceed certain critical thresholds; (2) a higher consumer marginal social-benefit potential (MSBP) or a lower consumer marginal perception difficulty (MPD) helps to lower the critical thresholds of CSR budgets and CSR operational efficiency by S and F, making it easier to achieve the win-win performance; (3) an increase in one supply chain members CSR budget or CSR operational efficiency tends to make the supply chain easier to attain a win-win performance scenario; (4) if CSR decisions are made sequentially, a prior commitment to CSR activities from one supply chain member strengthens the mutual incentive and facilitates the realization of the win-win performance.

The focus on sustainability is presumably not only goodwill or legislation driven but is rather a benefit driven action to achieve an economic surplus. The purpose of this paper is the development of an adequate sustainability definition, the investigation of the effect of a sustainability agenda on a company level, and the identification of possible financial benefits. Design/methodology/approach: This is an explorative qualitative and quantitative study. First, the authors developed a four-bottom-line real estate sustainability agenda in accordance with the guidelines of the European Public Real Estate Association and the Global Reporting Initiative.

Findings: After classifying firms across different levels of sustainability intensity and quantifying the impact of an intensive green agenda the authors found a positive linkage between a green agenda and a green performance, especially in terms of an increased ability to generate revenues and a decreased level of idiosyncratic stock volatility. As a result, green commitments are not merely altruisms but are economically driven instead.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilises a qualitative methodology in which a series of semi-structured telephone interviews and/or e-mail questionnaires with managers from six reporting companies in Latin America (Chile, Colombia, Uruguay) was conducted. The fact that one of the authors of this paper created the reporting model facilitated easier access to company managers and a deeper understanding of each situation. A literature review from European, US and Latin American sources provides a framework for discussion. Findings: The paper illustrates how value-added statements (which are based on conventional financial accounting) can provide relevant information for CSR accountability. The variety of experiences shown (different industries and diverse company ownership in separate countries) may suggest the wide potential of this reporting model. Research limitations/implications: As the paper deals with a recent, ongoing experience (this model has been in use for the last six years only), the results have to be treated with caution. Even though many firms are interested in adopting this value-added model, there are currently fewer than 20 reporting firms using it. Social implications: The paper aims to position value distribution and its accountability as relevant issues in CSR, particularly for developing countries. In addition, such an intuitive model might more easily reach the general public, something that rarely happens with conventional CSR reporting models.

In a context of state failure (immature institutions), paying taxes can guarantee neither the peaceful management of company operations nor the sustainable development of local communities. Moreover, multinationals have experienced that making resources and opportunities available to local communities is not enough. The Niger Delta in Nigeria is, in this regard, a textbook case that demonstrates the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the context of acute inequalities. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on fieldwork - quantitative and qualitative surveys - carried out in Nigeria for the past seven years, the paper builds on initiatives and approaches undertaken by Total, Agip and NPDC/Shell, consistent with their understanding of their role in society. Findings: Inequalities and imbalances (income, gender, inter-regional, sector-based) ferment frustrations and nurture insecurity and violence in the Niger Delta, therefore hindering sustainable development. As far as the relationship between oil companies and communities is concerned, the authors argue that oil multinationals have to foster an approach that targets the reduction of those exceptional inequalities for which they are partly responsible, as revealed with the ""double effect"" principle. Originality/value: Whereas CSR has been so far mainly studied as a management issue, this paper brings broader views and analyzes ethical, cultural and economic dynamics that underlie the acceptability of companies in their environment, in the specific context of the Niger Delta. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Development; Economic development; Inequalities; Multinational companies; Niger Delta; Nigeria; Oil; Redistribution; Social development; Social justice",,"Renouard, C.; ESSEC Business School - IRENE Institute, Cergy-Pontoise, France; email: renouard@essec.edu",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

The results further revealed that environmental credibility was more strongly associated with recycling intentions during games for respondents who were less involved in environmental issues.

Starting from the basic assumption that managers cannot meet all stakeholders' demands immediately and in a tailored manner, I contend, first, that an ambidextrous approach to stakeholder management is conducive to stakeholders' commitment to cooperate for the sustainable well-being of the firm and, second, that firm strategy and key decision makers' ethical commitment moderate the relationship between an ambidextrous stakeholder management and stakeholder commitment to cooperate. Furthermore, drawing on this theoretical framework, I attempt to address the call for the integration of strategy and ethics by proposing a three-level conceptual model that distinguishes the objectives, the field, and the levers of integration.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a theoretical analysis based on secondary data and empirical research. Findings: Business has various roles to play in the social and economic development of poorer countries, but are all of them equally important and laudable? Mainstream economics has long held that the private sector is essential to economic prosperity, and this has led policy-makers and neoliberal thinkers to treat it as a tool for development. But under what circumstances does business go beyond acting out its assigned role as a tool of development to become what this article calls a ""development agent"" - something that consciously strives to deliver, and moreover be held to account for, developmental outcomes? Research limitations/implications: The article presents a framework for a more structured approach to further empirical research, but does not claim to apply that framework in empirical situations. Social implications: Despite the considerable literature advocating why business should be a development agent, much less attention has been paid to two more fundamental questions: whether and under what circumstances business will take on such a role; and what being a development agent means. These are the central questions of this article. Answering them enables business practitioners, policy-makers and academics to predict more accurately when business engagement is likely to deliver genuine development value and be sustainable, and hence when it is a worthwhile business, advocacy or policy objective. It also enables improved decision-making by non-private sector partners such as development agencies and NGOs. Originality/value: The article addresses the above questions in turn with reference to empirical research by the author over nearly two decades, and both the corporate responsibility and the international development literature. It discusses what being a genuine development agent means, and provides a framework for understanding the business-poverty relationship based on business as a cause, a victim, and a solution in international development terms. It concludes with a discussion of how well business is performing as a development agent, and the future potential and limitations of this role. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bottom of the pyramid; Corporate responsibility; Economic development; International development; Poverty; Social enterprise; Social responsibility",,"Blowfield, M.; Smith School of Enterprise and Development, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; email: mick.blowfield@smithschool.oxac.uk",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

Non-whites were disadvantaged because of structures that limited their economic and social opportunities, leaving few from this vast group in the formal economy. Black economic empowerment (BEE and its more recent broad-based version) is a policy intervention driven from the economic and industrial complex in government. Aimed directly at addressing the economy's skewed racial profile, BEE calls the private sector to restructure itself and create opportunities for previously disadvantaged individuals (PDIs). The policy requires change to intra and inter-firm relational patterns of capital and control, personnel selection, promotion and development, supplier selection, enterprise development and social engagement. Organisational theory argues that these kinds of intra and inter-firm relational structures and the networks they establish influence who participates in economies and how these people benefit. This argument supports the contention that BEE's focal changes are necessary to open the economy and adjust its racial composition. If the structures that have entrenched patterns of access to economic opportunities remain static they will not allow inclusion of previously excluded groups. The argument could also be used to view BEE as a potential South African growth catalyst.

There is a revaluation of the present principles of business based on achieving profit. Corporate social responsibility is a long-term sustainable solution in the form of engagement of the business sector in solving the problems of society. Responsible businesses make an economic profit and social benefit by their commitment to ethical conduct and social responsibility, whereas irresponsible businesses steal the resources of the state and society. This means that tax evasion can also be considered a manifestation of unethical conduct. In the long term income tax is a significant source of finance for public budgets of the Slovak Republic used for financing the needs of the state and society. This paper presents the results of primary research focused on analysis of tax evasion on income tax in the context of corporate social responsibility in the Slovak Republic.

The framework includes variables that explain underlying mechanisms (i.e., relationship- and value-based mediator variables) of CSR-outcomes relationships and contingency effects (i.e., people-, place-, price-, and profile-based moderator variables) that explain conditions under which the relationship between CSR and its outcomes change. The authors' review reveals important knowledge gaps related to the adoption of different theoretical orientations by researchers studying CSR at different levels of analysis, the need to understand underlying mechanisms linking CSR with outcomes, the need for research at micro levels of analysis (i.e., individuals and teams), and the need for methodological approaches that will help address these substantive knowledge gaps. Accordingly, they offer a detailed research agenda for the future, based on a multilevel perspective that aims to integrate diverse theoretical frameworks as well as develop an understanding of underlying mechanisms and microfoundations of CSR (i.e., foundations based on individual action and interactions). The authors also provide specific suggestions regarding research design, measurement, and data-analytic approaches that will be instrumental in carrying out their proposed research agenda. © The Author(s) 2012.","corporate citizenship; corporate social performance; corporate social responsibility; microfoundations of corporate social responsibility; sustainability",,"Aguinis, H.; Department of Management and Entrepreneurship, Kelley School of Business, Indiana University, 1309 East 10th Street, Bloomington, IN 47405-170, United States; email: haguinis@indiana.edu",,,01492063,,JOMAD,,"English","J.

The investigation focuses on two main questions: What are the core components for the development of a CSR brand? What capabilities are necessary to implement a CSR-related brand strategy? Design/methodology/approach: Five firms provide input for a multiple case-based approach. Findings: Intuitive and intended approaches for CSR brand leadership emerge from the multiple case study results. Different capabilities are required at each stage of the development and implementation process for CSR brand leadership. Research limitations/implications: This research extends three prior studies - Aaker and Joachimsthaler's brand leadership framework, Maon et al.'s proposed integrative framework for designing and implementing CSR, and Beverland et al.'s capabilities view on the development of global brand leadership - and fills a theoretical gap. Practical implications: Managers can use the proposed integrated and implementable framework to determine the impact of dynamic factors, such as ownership, culture, executive leadership, and the specific context of product and corporate branding, on the development and implementation of their CSR brand. Originality/value: No studies examine how to leverage CSR in brand-building activities. Specifically, no empirically grounded research examines the required path to create and manage CSR brands and associated benefits, nor is the number of capabilities required to develop a credible CSR brand clear. Comprehensive models of the processes for developing and implementing CSR brands and the capabilities that underlie them are needed. The proposed model emphasizes the contextualized need to rely on different capabilities at different stages of this development process to generate constructive and sustainable outcomes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand building; Brand leadership; Brands; Capabilities; Case studies; Corporate responsibility; Leadership",,"Lindgreen, A.; Cardiff Business School, University of Cardiff, Cardiff, United Kingdom; email: LindgreenA@cardiff.ac.uk",,,03090566,,,,"English","Eur.

The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the impact of CSR factors and financial factors on the performance of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Australia (A-REITs) and assess whether these three CSR factors are separately priced by A-REIT investors in uniquely adding value to A-REIT investment performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using CSR rating factors and financial factors for the 16 A-REITs in the ASX200, cross-sectional multi-factor models are employed to identify the separate pricing of these CSR factors in A-REIT performance over 2005-2010. Findings: The empirical results show that the environmental, social and corporate governance dimensions of CSR are not currently separately priced by A-REIT investors, with most of the A-REIT performance accounted for by the financial factors. Amongst the three CSR dimensions, corporate governance is seen to be the most influential CSR factor on A-REIT performance. Practical implications: This paper empirically determines that the CSR dimensions of environment, social and corporate governance are currently less influential than the financial factors of size, book-to-market value, gearing and beta in influencing A-REIT performance. Given the increased role of CSR amongst A-REITs, corporate governance is seen to have a more influential role in A-REIT pricing than either environmental or social factors. This finding also has practical implications for CSR practices in other REIT markets internationally. Originality/value: This paper is the first published property research analysis on the separate role of CSR factors, compared to the traditional financial factors, in the performance of A-REITs.

The present paper conceptually and empirically characterises the public policies on CSR in Europe. In a first (conceptual) step, public policies on CSR are portrayed by distinguishing five types of policy instruments (i.e. legal, economic, informational, partnering, and hybrid tools) that can be employed in four fields of action (i.e. awareness for CSR, transparency, socially responsible investment, and leading by example). In a second (empirical) step, this typology is employed to show how EU member states actually promote CSR policies. The empirical stocktaking provides an overview of more than 200 policy instruments in three of the four fields of action. In a third step, the paper compares the status of public policies on CSR in Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). By means of a simple instrument count and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) it is shown that Western European (particularly Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian) governments are significantly more active in promoting CSR than governments in CEE countries. Since these differences mirror the differences regarding the popularity of CSR as a management approach in Europe, the paper concludes that public policies on CSR reinforce rather than offset the European 'CSR gap'. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Corporate social responsibility/CSR; CSR policies; Public policies on CSR; Socially responsible investment/SRI; Sustainable public procurement/SPP",,"Steurer, R.; InFER - Institute of Forest, Environmental Natural Resource Policy, BOKU University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria; email: reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at",,,15353958,,,,"English","Corp.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors suggest that CSR is a shared strategic asset based on insights from the industrial organization and institutional schools, taking into account that there are determinants of CSR that may be operating inside the corporation according to the resource-based view. They employ a variance components method and a sample compiled of 495 US firms from 19 industries using five-year periods. Findings: The study indicates that firms retain considerable self-determinism regarding their CSR trajectories, but the latter also represent a shared strategic asset. Thus, these results combined imply that CSR needs to be examined on both levels simultaneously. Practical implications: The results of this study can provide non-governmental organizations and governmental and regulatory institutions with an indicator that explains the performance variation levels of each dimension of CSR, and can help improve tools designed to promote it. Furthermore, the authors' research provides managers with evidence of CSR variability among CSR dimensions that could help in strategic decision-making. In addition this research can provide assistance and give perspective regarding selection criteria for investment portfolios in responsible investment funds. Originality/value: The industry effect is an important factor to consider in CSR intensity. The variation in firm and industry effects on CSR strategies has not been extensively studied; hence, explaining the sources of performance differences regarding industry and firm factors is a key theoretical and empirical issue in the field of management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Companies; Firm effects; Industrial organization; Industry effects; Institutional theory; Resource-based view; Social responsibility",,"Moura-Leite, R.

The methodology is based on the model presented by Carroll (1979), considering the different interdisciplinary dimensions contemplated by CSR. The survey results are used to construct a second order factorial model that enables us to measure and evaluate firms' CSR considering the concept's different dimensions. The model enables us to globally measure firms' CSP by integrating its different dimensions and learning specific details of the variables involved and their relationships, and could be a useful guide for corporations willing to objectively implement sustainability management. We apply the procedure to evaluate the behaviour of a sample of 416 Spanish firms. Our results suggest that there is a positive relationship between firms' CSP and aspects such as size, degree of CSR awareness and stakeholder pressure. Therefore, in order to increase the degree of CSR implantation in Spanish firms, specific lines of action aimed at increasing the level of awareness of CSR practices should be addressed, particularly at small firms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the technique of panel data in a sample of 624 American listed companies from 2001 to 2007. The literature review builds on the contradictions between the instrumental stakeholder theory and the slack-resources hypothesis to argue that both concepts are not fully compatible. Findings - The results indicate that prior financial performance, measured as market value added, positively affects CSP. The results further confirm that slack resources are assigned to specific areas of involvement of CSP (product issues, community relations, environmental issues, employee relations and diversity of the work force), rather than to a unified conception of CSP. Research limitations/implications - The current trend in social responsibility regards Friedman's arguments as old-fashioned and assumes the instrumental stakeholder to be true. The results presented here indicate that part of Friedman's claims may be occurring in reality, so further investigation is needed before they are disregarded. Practical implications - The multidimensional nature of CSP, here proposed and confirmed by the exploratory models, indicates that each dimension of social performance may be impacted by the availability of funds different intensities; and according to the instrumental view (assuming the virtuous circle is true), investment in each particular dimension may provide a different level of return to the firm. Originality/value - The slack resources hypothesis has been the least researched of the two hypotheses relating to the corporate social and financial performance (CSP and CFP) links. Although the slack resources hypothesis may explain the relation as well as the good management hypothesis, most studies tend to focus on the first one, basing their argumentation on the assumption that superior CFP comes as a result of a strategic CSP.

Business schools, both in the UK and worldwide, have been accused of failing to address issues of governance in their curricula. Can the assumption be made that current curricula will have prepared students to evaluate this key concept critically? This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Taking a case study approach, this work sets out to explore the attitudes of a cohort of 43 final-year undergraduate students studying in a UK business school. It focuses on an analysis of their written work on the sourcing of copper from Chile and its procurement by the UK Royal Mint for coinage. Findings - The findings indicate that students valued the inclusion of corporate social responsibility in its widest context, and would welcome earlier inclusion within their curricula. Originality/value - This is a timely point in their academic studies, as the students are preparing for study at Master's level or for the job market. The coursework required research into the production process of raw material at the copper mines in Chile, as well as the ethical decision-making process of a UK governmental agency. Although this is a small-scale study, it does offer some interesting insights into student perspectives. The paper concludes with recommendations for future curriculum development.

Design/methodology/approach - The study employs ancient insights from the core of Buddhist teaching, featuring the Four Noble Truths and the concept of ""me"" and ""mine"", for the modern application of CSR by investigating the crux of major related theories. Findings - The Noble Truths emphasize that suffering should be eradicated at its root. The Buddhist model of CSR suggests that beyond doing good such as supporting philanthropy and avoiding evil as mitigating the impact of corporate malpractice, which are consistent with major CSR theories, it is also crucial to purify the hearts of stakeholders from the ""self"" and ""what belongs to self"", the genesis of suffering. Detachment is the key. Research implications - The shift from an institutional to an individual level, more specifically the transformation from a mindset of over-consumption to one of conscious consumption, is an alternative direction to the progress of theory and practice in CSR. Practical implications - Defiled by greed and profitability, consumers and investors, who provide income and funding to an organization and define its business practice, are of the highest priority among all stakeholders to start the change according to the Buddhist model of CSR.

However, it was already clear that book publishing, like every other industry would have to face up to the incipient challenges posed by the growing global phenomena of organizational sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Clearly this would require a response of a different order than before, not least in view of the greatly expanded range of potential factors involved. Our treatment of sustainability addresses two main themes: sustainability in the context of global concerns about resource depletion and destruction of the biosphere, and organizational sustainability in the at times adversarial relationship between profit seeking and good corporate citizenship. This paper begins with a look at some of the key terminology around sustainability in order to reinforce its relevance and applicability to the publishing industry. This necessarily limited treatment is confined to four key concepts namely: corporate sustainability, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance and corporate measurement and reporting. We then present some evidence for industry response to the principles and practical challenges of sustainability and relate these to implications for the design of appropriate business models.

This article details what actually happens when the laws of the host country fail to ensure adequate protection. The focus here is on land dispossession and loss of livelihood in relation to a gold mine project in central Ghana. How is it that a well-known international company-Newmont-with its own corporate social responsibility (CSR) statements sets up a project in the year 2003 that displaces subsistence farmers from their land without compensating in cash or with replacement land? The analysis identifies the factors that lead the company to not compensate farmers for their lost land: cost-cutting, strict adherence to the law, CSR commitment that was new and not internalized, complexities of the Ghanaian land tenure system, peer pressure to preserve the status quo, selection of an ""old-school"" CSR manager, and the inadequacy of Ghanaian mining law to account for relatively novel, ""open-pit"" mining techniques. However, the specter of famine raised by civil society activism, the involvement of the International Financial Corporation, and a better qualified CSR team constitute another set of factors that lead to a comprehensive package of livelihood improvement measures. There is a contrast between the complexity, long-term, and advanced type of assistance Newmont currently envisages and the backward, short-term, formalism, and brutality of denying compensation for land back in 2003.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted through a multi-site, comparative case study using three large corporations with exemplary sustainability standings. Key employees from each organization were interviewed. Interview transcripts and sustainability reports were analyzed using discourse analysis, and a constructivist approach to grounded theory was used to build a model for how sustainability emerges at the organizational, functional, and individual levels. Findings: Within the corporations studied, different perspectives toward sustainability exist. At the organizational level, senior leadership defines sustainability and establishes an integrated culture by aligning sustainability with business purposes and driving sustainability priorities through the organization. At the functional level, managers assume a differentiated perspective and translate organizational sustainability goals into tools and programs for facilities, suppliers, and employees. At the individual level, based upon different cultural influences, independent actors assume a fragmented perspective. Each of these perspectives influences the others and is essential to the long-term success of a commitment to sustainability. Research limitations/implications: Viewing sustainability through multiple perspectives presents an interesting approach for research. Most sustainability literature addresses change from an organizational level. Therefore, addressing sustainability change from an organizational, a subcultural, and an individual level provides further insight into how sustainability develops within organizations.

Specifically, we examine how three areas of accounting expertise (risk identification and measurement, financial reporting, and independent review/assurance) contribute to the strategic integration of sustainability initiatives (cf. Porter and Kramer 2006; IIRC 2011). Our results indicate that accounting professionals are rarely involved in sustainability initiatives, but their involvement is highly associated with strategic integration. This finding suggests that increased involvement likely would provide significant benefits to organizations and their stakeholders. We use these and other important insights into a series of research questions for future accounting or interdisciplinary research in sustainability. These insights about accountants' ability to enhance the strategic integration of sustainability initiatives also should be of interest to accounting and consulting firms as they design and market their sustainability services.","Corporate social responsibility; Integrated reporting; Strategy; Sustainability",,"Ballou, B.; Miami UniversityUnited States; email: balloubj@muohio.edu",,,08887993,,,,"English","Account.

Design/methodology/approach: The annual reports of 27 GLCs for two years (2005 and 2007) were analysed using content analysis. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify factors influencing CSR disclosure in annual reports. Findings: Consistent with expectations, the paired-sample t-tests showed that there was an increase (significant at the 1 percent level) in the extent of CSR disclosure. The multiple regression analysis revealed that board size was positively associated and statistically significant (at the 1 percent level) with the extent of CSR disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The regression model reported an R 2 of 33.9 percent, which means that almost 66 percent of factors influencing CSR disclosure in Malaysian GLCs have not been captured by the model. These other factors may perhaps be identified through other research methods such as questionnaire surveys or interviews. Practical implications: The findings appear to suggest that the government efforts in promoting CSR among GLCs through the introduction of the Silver Book in 2006 have had some positive impact on CSR disclosure in annual reports. The results also imply that larger board size through wider exchange of ideas and experience could lead to better appreciation and involvement in corporate social activities and hence disclosure in annual reports.

It basically advocates that the corporation, a juridical person, has a great impact on modern society, whereby it engages itself in economic activities, makes profits and contributes to national economy by paying taxes, employing human persons, and meeting people's needs by producing products and providing services. On top of everything, however, its prime objective is to earn profits for the shareholders. Scholars argue that along with this objective, the corporation owes responsibilities to other stakeholders, such as the creditors, employees, consumers, environment and the community as a whole. In other words, profits should not be its sole target; it should take care of the interests of other stakeholders. Islamic scholars have found the concept coincides well with Shari'ah in general, as it holds some reservations with respect to particular issues.

Rowe Management Bldg, 6100 Univ.Ave., 3rd Floor, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada","Despite recognizing the importance of developing authentic corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, noticeably absent from the literature is consideration for how employees distinguish between authentic and inauthentic CSR programs. This is somewhat surprising given that employees are essentially the face of their organization and are largely expected to act as ambassadors for the organization's CSR program (Collier and Esteban in Bus Ethics 16:19-33, 2007). The current research, by conducting depth interviews with employees, builds a better understanding of how employees differentiate between authentic and inauthentic CSR programs, and how these judgments influence their perceptions of the organization. We find that employees rely on two different referent standards to form authenticity judgments-the extent to which the image put forth in the CSR program aligns with the organization's true identity and the extent to which the CSR program itself is developmental. To assess the former, employees draw on cues about resource commitment, alignment between elements of the organization's CSR program, emotional engagement, justice, and embeddedness.

This 'beyond' can be described along the 'triple bottom line' of sustainability (social, environmental and economic dimensions). Dealing with these dimensions is under discussion in societies and some propose the stakeholder concept as a framework for companies to identify their responsibilities. However, who counts as a key stakeholder and what is a legitimate stake are difficult to determine. This article discusses reasons, possibilities and difficulties of managing responsibility in innovation, taking two cases of genetically modified organisms as examples. It is argued that the stakeholder approach is necessary to provide different perspectives, but is not enough or even completely unsuitable for defining responsibilities. Moral responsibility involves judgement that differs between stakeholders and might vary over time, owing to emerging insights and changing priorities. Therefore, pursuing or abandoning a particular project does not constitute a responsible organization; rather, it is the preparation of decisions, accountability and the resulting pattern of behaviour that renders an organization responsible. The various notions of responsibility set the scene for discussion but do not provide a clear answer to the questions of right or wrong and good or ill intent. Key conclusions are that companies need to organize for responsibility and that responsibility needs to be complemented with accountability. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,"Weisenfeld, U.; University of LüneburgGermany; email: weisenfe@unilueneburg.de",,,09631690,,,,"English","Creat.

Design/methodology/approach: The model is developed by the integration of approaches from the marketing, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and psychological contract literature and represents a holistic and multi-disciplinary perspective on the service value proposition. Findings: Analysis shows how alignment of different types of value proposition with consumer expectations impacts on the nature and level of consumer commitment. Customer commitment can also contribute to service provider reputation and brand equity. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual framework and research propositions generated from it should be tested in organisations representative of transactional, relational and transpersonal service providers to provide deeper insights for researchers and practitioners.

A central hypothesis, that we test in this paper is that companies which attend to this set of responsibilities under the term superior sustainable practices, have higher financial performance compared to those that do not engage in such practices. The target population of this study consists of the top 100 sustainable global companies in 2008 which have been selected from a universe of 3,000 firms from the developed countries and emerging markets. We find significant higher mean sales growth, return on assets, profit before taxation, and cash flows from operations in some activity sectors of the sample companies compared to the control companies over the period of 2006-2010. Furthermore, our findings show that the higher financial performance of sustainable companies has increased and been sustained over the sample.

Innovation literature, on the other hand, underlines other important determinants of eco-innovations, mainly the supply-side factors such as firms' organisational capabilities and demand-side mechanisms, such as customer requirements and societal requirements on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This paper brings together the views of these different disciplines and provides empirical insights on the drivers of eco-innovations based on a novel dataset of 1566 UK firms that responded to the Government Survey of Environmental Protection Expenditure by Industry in 2006. By applying the Heckman selection model, our findings indicate that demand factors affect the decision of the firm to undertake eco-innovations whilst these factors exhibit no impact upon the level of investments in eco-innovations. Hence, we suggest that firms initiate eco-innovations in order to satisfy the minimum customer and societal requirements, yet, increased investments in eco-innovations are stimulated by other factors such as cost savings, firms' organisational capabilities, and stricter regulations. Based on a quantile regression analysis, the paper offers interesting insights for policy makers, by showing that the stringency of environmental regulations affects eco-innovations of the less innovative firms differently from those of the more innovative firms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This idea has been both celebrated and criticized in the literature. We do neither in this paper. Instead, by leveraging insights from Amartya Sen's work on capability development and the literature on social capital, we offer a more socially embedded and community-centric BoP approach. By redefining poverty not just as a lack of income, but also as a lack of 'capabilities' in Sen's sense that can be developed through leveraging social capital, we offer a systemic framework for understanding the societal impact of business-driven ventures in the BoP and empowering BoP communities through these ventures. Specifically, we argue that any business initiative in the BoP ought to be evaluated on the basis of whether it advances capability transfer and retention by (a) enhancing the social capital between a particular community and other more resource rich networks, and (b) preserving the existing social capital in the community. © 2012 The Authors.

Research suggests that motivational and cognitive changes due to aging might cause information to be differentially utilized. The authors use primary and secondary control influences on information processing to explain why older consumers perceive themselves as less susceptible to the threats associated with a product harm crisis. This has important implications in terms of blame attributions, and marketing variables of interest such as purchase intentions and negative word of mouth. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted in which participants were asked to read a short newspaper article about a product harm crisis and to respond to a series of questions. Participants were split into two groups based on age. Findings: The empirical findings indicate that, compared with younger consumers, older consumers perceive product harm crises as less threatening, place less blame on the company, and have stronger intentions to purchase and recommend the product involved in the crisis. Practical implications: The finding that the more physically vulnerable older population actually perceives themselves as less vulnerable to harm suggests that socially responsible companies should work harder to make older consumers aware of risks created by product harm crises when dealing with this increasingly important target market.

As discourses express specific stances expressed by a group of people who share particular beliefs and values, they constitute an important means of restoring organisational legitimacy when social rules and norms have been violated. Using an analytical framework based on legitimacy as a process of reciprocal sense-making and consisting of three levels of analysis which capture the relationship between text and context, we investigate the discourse used by CEOs in their initial and subsequent accounts of the incident. We find that CEOs aim to negotiate a resolution between their initial account and organisational audiences' incongruent interpretations of the event by adopting an ad hoc normative attitude to stakeholders. This manifests itself in the strategic use of the discourse of stakeholder engagement as a means of signalling change, yet maintaining the status quo. It suggests that CEOs strategically use discourse to manufacture organisational audiences' consent regarding the continued operation of the nuclear power plant affected by the incident.

Such a conception of collaborative responsibility is characterized by five key elements: first, it is based on the moral imperative for collaboration. Second, it shifts emphasis from commission to omission. Third, it is not only negative but also, and perhaps essentially, positive responsibility. Fourth, it is political responsibility.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds upon the extant relational theories in management, and presents a holistic multi-level framework (the system/network, issue-based or strategic nets, dyadic relationships and the network organization) to conceptualize change for sustainability. Findings: By adopting INA business is able to discuss: the nature and role of the network in building systems level change; the role of dyadic relations as a central mechanism for change; and the nature of organizational level capabilities necessary to enhance learning for sustainability. Research limitations/implications: Areas of future inquiry include examination of the dynamics of intra-stakeholder relationships over time, specifically the development of actors' attitudes, behavior and cognition in business networks alongside how actors perceive and capitalize on network embedded learning. Further scholarly attention in these areas can further the appreciation of how an INA can assist in building more sustainable organizational futures. Practical implications: The paper builds on the concept of ""ecological literacy"" at an organizational level, and considers the specific capabilities required including network visioning, orchestration and the ability to perceive the ""other"" as partners in creating new market realities.

Under the umbrella of change management today frequently holistic approaches are discussed. The special significance of soft factors results from the area of tension of subjective/personal risk assessment of certain groups of actors, which entail comprehensive changes. As change projects depend on implementation by executives and employees, change communications is a form of (internal) strategic stakeholder management. Change communications can be identified as the single part of change management, which focuses on the soft factors that are activated through the change of hard factors. With the management of soft factors the aim is to make a contribution to the enforcement of change goals, i.e. to secure or to regain the management's power. For this purpose 60 PR-agencies in Germany have been polled, as to how they assess the possibilities and reality of change communications. The result illustrates a torn of the agency scene between service and consulting claims, which emphasizes the question, if (internal) communication means the organization of messages and its delivery or also becomes part of behavioral economics with the idea to control the power of management. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..","Change communications; Change management; Internal communications; Power",,"Lies, J.Klosterstr. 28, 48143 Münster, Germany; email: jan.lies@jan-lies.de",,,03638111,,PRERE,,"English","Public Relat.

Design/methodology/approach: Using content analysis and a quality score index, the study examined a panel data set covering the period from 1999 to 2008. The data was collected from a sample of 270 annual reports of 27 UK companies taken from the top 100 companies for corporate responsibility (BITC ranking, 2008). The research framework involves the use of signalling theory to investigate the information content of CCID. Findings: It is found that the volume of corporate community disclosure (CCID) has a significant association with its total quality score (TQS) although the impact was found to be very small. CCID was also found to be strongly and positively associated with the volume of total CSR disclosed in annual reports. Hence the quantity and quality of CCID in annual reports increased significantly as the quantity of CSR disclosure also increased. Furthermore, the TQS was found to respond to company size and Corporate Governance measures such as audit committee size and board composition, and the existence of standalone CSR Reports, while other measures of public pressure such as leverage, profitability and industrial sector were not statistically significantly related with TQS. Originality/value: This paper contributes to CSR literature in general and CCID literature in particular. The originality stems from the fact that it employs a signalling framework and a panel study approach as opposed to cross-sectional only or time-series only data to examine a less researched social disclosure - corporate community involvement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Annual reports; Community involvement; Corporate governance; Disclosures; Signalling theory; Social responsibility; United Kingdom",,"Yekini, K.; Department of Accounting and Finance, Leicester Business School, De Montfort University, Leicester, United Kingdom; email: kyekini@dmu.ac.uk",,,20408021,,,,"English","Sustainability Account.

Design/methodology/approach: The article offers a unique interdisciplinary take on relevant research in international CSR, political science, international relations and philosophy. Its methodology is based on a literature review of these different fields. Findings: The article argues that the rules-based nature of international CSR is based on experience in the relatively benign market context of high-income economies. However, the transposition of the code-and-compliance approach to the more conflictual context of emerging markets leads to the failure of international CSR. Its insufficient catering to the particular pressures exerted on operation in these markets reveals an idealist bias. This explains the implicit endorsement of ""end-of-history"" scenarios and other neo-liberal assumptions in international CSR. The article argues that this disposition does not pay credit to the need to find adequate responses to the situation. Quite to the contrary, the firm entrenchment of (neo-)liberalism in the mental mapping of CSR blocks the way to an exploration of realist alternatives. The article concludes by suggesting a shift in the CSR research agenda, from rules to institutions and agency. It proposes historical material on leadership in emergency situations and a new reading of Machiavelli to illustrate possible avenues. Research limitations/implications: The article is based on a qualitative review and discussion of the literature, which it presents in a new light. It does not present empirical or quantitative research data. It points to a conceptual abyss separating the theory and reality of international CSR. This is particularly problematic in the light of recent deliberative models positing a ""new political role"" for the corporation. While this article follows the new model in its criticism of the traditional separation of politics and business, it advocates that further research is necessary to elucidate how a more realistic apprehension of global conflict and its impact on business can be combined with the ""arms reach principle"". Furthermore it urges that a new model must factor in the frequent ""dirty hands"" problems occurring in international business. Practical implications: The article argues that, contrary to the dominant liberal discourse in business ethics and CSR, an increasing potential for Machiavellian behavior in the corporate sector is to be expected. This is due to the absence of arbitrages, in an environment experiencing a rapid expansion of global corporate activity. This renders ""code-and-compliance"" CSR ineffective. The article recommends the ""reframing"" of CSR, to specifically include ""dirty hands"" issues. Social implications: One stumbling block to a correct understanding of the contemporary challenges impacting international business operations is the (neo-)liberal globalisation paradigm - a narrative in whose manufacture business schools and management scholars are complicit. Originality/value: The article contributes to the discussion on ""systemic CSR"".

Research Findings/Insights: We use firm-level data for more than 600 European firms from 16 countries and 35 industries for 2005. We find that ownership by employees, individuals, and firms is associated with relatively poor corporate social policies of the firms they invest in. In contrast, the holdings by banks and institutional investors as well as those by the state appear to be neutral in this respect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study develops and tests notions as to how particular types of owners could have a specific impact on the firm's CSR. The relative value put upon CSR can differ along different types of owners. This results from their different economic roles in society. The study provides empirical support for the relationship between ownership type and CSR policies in Europe. As such, it provides a new focus on the content of shareholder activism, namely that shareholder background has to be taken into account. Another innovation is that we show it is important to account for the multidimensional nature of CSR as well. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers a new perspective for firms, investors and other stakeholders about portfolio investments and CSR. As we find that it does matter who invests, corporate engagement policies can be directed much more effectively. In particular, the investors who act as intermediaries appear to be the most sensitive ones in this respect. Our study suggests that firms should take the background of their shareholders into account in relation to their CSR strategy. Furthermore, our study helps stakeholders to direct their efforts more effectively. It also provides a perspective for executives and investment managers of multinational firms to consider if and how they can create social value next to shareholder value. We suggest that policy makers promote the transparency of ownership information as well as that of CSR performance. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Firm policy; Investor activism; Investor type",,"Scholtens, B.; Department of Economics, Econometrics and Finance, Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, P.O.

Although many authors of this approach have reviewed many elements of the model, they have unconditionally accepted several criteria assumed by Freeman (1984) to identify stakeholders. In general, stakeholder authors have assumed that (a) the company establishes dyadic relationships with other agents, and (b) decisions made by a company only have foreseen and direct effects on other agents. These criteria have enabled researchers to understand simple processes. However, they have also prevented researchers from explaining how action comes about, and how responsibility is shared, in many complex processes taking place in contemporary societies. Such complex processes involve many agents, and each decision can generate unexpected effects which accumulate or disseminate. Furthermore, the normative structure governing these processes can affect and/or be affected by the actions of agents. In this study, we propose new criteria to expand the stakeholder model and facilitate the study of CSR in such processes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Contemporary societies; Corporate responsibility; Effects; Relationships; Stakeholder approach",,"Rimbau-Gilabert, E.; Department of Economics and Business Science, Open University of Catalonia (UOC), Av.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design was used as the methodological basis for the study. In-depth interviews were conducted in India with a total of 26 participants (19 males and 7 females). Interviews lasted between one and two hours and were conducted until saturation in responses was achieved. Findings: Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed via a thematic approach; six themes emerged that are used to organize participants' responses regarding CSR in the apparel industry. A conceptual framework grounded in the data was developed that highlights relationships between factors that surfaced as important to CSR in the decision-making process. Research limitations/implications: Because data were collected specifically with Indian consumers, study findings may not be applicable to consumers in other developing countries. Participants were asked about their perceptions of CSR as consumers, thus it would also be important to know how manufacturers in India view CSR and what it means for their businesses. Practical implications: Results of this study provide in-depth insight into Indian consumers' perceptions of CSR in the apparel industry. Understanding CSR from the Indian consumers' perspective helps to articulate the economic and social value of addressing ethical concerns within the global apparel supply chain. Originality/value: The paper's findings are consistent with those of previous studies on CSR and the paper is one of the first to examine the issues relative to the Indian consumer population. India is an important sourcing destination for international apparel retailers, and at the same time, boasts a large population of consumers with a growing level of purchasing power. The paper provides insight into what this group thinks about CSR in an industry that contributes significantly to their country's economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Apparel industry; Consumer behaviour; Corporate social responsibility; Garment industry; India",,"Gupta, M.; Department of Consumer, Apparel and Retail Studies, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, United States; email: m_gupta@uncg.edu",,,13612026,,,,"English","J.

Findings show that, while the number of entities institutionalizing CSR values as core elements of their identities is still reduced, most organizations disclose CSR information to construct communicated identities and legitimate behaviours. Besides, these dimensions are classified depending on the stakeholder the action is aimed to, and that entities favour the generation of distinctive identities through the implementation and communication of more visible CSR actions like those involving their customers or the community.

We find that the issuance of stand-alone CSR reports is associated with lower analyst forecast error. This relationship is stronger in countries that are more stakeholder-oriented-i.e., in countries where CSR performance is more likely to affect firm financial performance. The relationship is also stronger for firms and countries with more opaque financial disclosure, suggesting that issuance of stand-alone CSR reports plays a role complementary to financial disclosure.

The second is to ascertain whether there are significant differences between CSR parameters estimated in the purchasing decisions of consumers from Peru and Spain. Finally, the authors aim to measure people's trade-off between the social (CSR) and traditional (CA) features of their purchasing decisions in terms of their willingness to pay.

Findings: It was found that there is a positive relationship between CSR and CA regarding consumer behaviour and that Peruvian consumers seem to be more sensitive to CSR features of products than Spanish consumers.

This means stakeholders can be misled and gives disadvantage to honest companies. The aim of this paper is to evaluate if the social-environmental actions by the companies are congruent with the definition of CSR given by the European Commission.

Importantly, good organisations usually seek to do more for its workers than the minimum standards established by the employment law. Good human resource management managers also need to have a good knowledge and understanding of the employment law so that the implementation of the employment law does not become a burdensome task.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study approach was adopted, using purposive sampling to select seven export garment manufacturers of varying size and business model in Sri Lanka. Primary data were collected through on-site, face-to-face interviews with managerial level and operational level informants within each company and through non-participant observation within factory environments. Findings: It was found that harnessing the local cultural context can support and progress CSR implementation at the factory level: in Sri Lanka, the Buddhist philosophy provided the moral underpinning and hence facilitated supplier engagement with CSR implementation. The presence of governmental support reduces the likelihood of CSR transgressions by adding an extra level of accountability for suppliers. Furthermore, the level of socioeconomic development also affects CSR implementation, as managerial competency increases with higher education levels. Practical implications: Analysing the success of CSR implementation in the Sri Lankan export garment manufacturing industry enables the identification of country-specific factors which support CSR implementation. The managerial perspective taken within the research would be of use to fashion brands and retailers that are looking for ways of progressing CSR implementation in their global supply chains. Originality/value: This paper presents industry-specific data from a key global garment manufacturing country on a commercially sensitive subject.

This internationalisation has attracted a great deal of interest from both scholars and practitioners. Advance of these companies into Western markets has become a contentious topic; quite often, it is due to the clashes between the distinctly Russian managerial style and the Western style of classic management. Yet, the interplay between the specificities of the Russian managerial style and the process of firm internationalisation remains an under-researched topic. The paper seeks to fill this gap and to examine management practices in Russian companies, with a specific emphasis on internationalisation. The study provides a detailed account of several elements of these practices, such as human resource management, knowledge management, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility.

Some of the institutions even connect environmental and sustainability issues with their general business strategies. Compared with other countries, Canadian banks are best in class, as all six Canadian commercial banks, comprising over 90 percent of Canadian assets, systematically examine environmental risks for credits, loans and mortgages.

It fills a gap in the literature on CSR and legitimacy that lacks empirical studies regarding the question whether CSR contributes to organisational legitimacy. The problem is discussed by referring to the case of De Beers's diamond mining partnership with the Government of Namibia. A total of 42 interviews were conducted-41 with stakeholders and one with the focal organisation Namdeb. The 41 stakeholder interviews are analysed with regard to cognitive, pragmatic and moral legitimacy as defined by Suchman (Acad Manage Rev 20(3):571-610, 1995). The main finding is that the majority of statements on organisational legitimacy refer to moral legitimacy and most issues raised in this context challenge the company's legitimacy despite its comprehensive CSR engagement. The study demonstrates that legitimacy gaps can be a result of communication practices that raise unrealistic stakeholder expectations and that the legitimacy gained by CSR engagement in one area cannot substitute legitimacy losses caused by failures in another. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; De Beers; Legitimacy; Namdeb; Namibia; Public private joint venture; Social responsibility",,"Claasen, C.; Management and Organisation Department, ESC Rennes School of Business, 2, rue Robert d'Arbrissel, 35065 Rennes, France; email: cyrlene.claasen@esc-rennes.fr",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

In departure from prior studies, which mainly examined the impact of social or environmental accidents on corporate disclosure, we examined voluntary disclosures for two years, 2006 and 2009, in an attempt to determine whether the 2007/08 financial crisis had some impact on corporate voluntary disclosure (CVD). Drawing on proprietary costs theory, we argued that in times of financial crisis companies might not have afforded the costly process of additional voluntary disclosures due to the related preparation and competitive costs. Hence, companies would have provided less voluntary information after the financial crisis. On the other hand, the financial crisis might have forced companies to be involved in more social activities to legitimize their existence. It could be argued that the public was in greater need during the financial crisis, and hence their expectations from company contributions might have been higher. To reduce the possibility of legitimacy gap, companies may have increased their involvement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) Programs, which in turn led to increased corporate disclosure. Using a self-constructed disclosure checklist, the findings of the study indicate that the extent and quality of CVDs provided in the annual reports of sample companies increased significantly following the recent global financial crisis. The results also reveal that based on the category of information (that is, strategic, financial, CSR), CSR information was the most widely disclosed category following the financial crisis. These findings support the view that companies utilize their annual report voluntary disclosures as a means of influencing society's perception of their operations, and as a means of legitimizing their existence. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","annual reports; corporate voluntary disclosures; fi nancial crisis; legitimacy; Malaysia; proprietary costs",,"Mohd Ghazali, N.A.; Department of Accounting, Kulliyyah of Economics and Management Sciences, International Islamic University Malaysia, Jalan Gombak, 53100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",,,17413591,,,,"English","Int.

We argue that this perspective helps scholars explore the dynamic interplay between symbolic and material aspects of standardization and understand better the discursive antecedents of coupling processes in organizations. Drawing on the case of the Equator Principles standard in international project finance, we empirically study how narratives create meaning shared by both business firms and their societal observers, thereby exemplifying the analytical merit of a narrative approach to CR standardization. © The Author(s) 2012.","corporate responsibility; decoupling; Equator Principles; institutionalization; narratives; standardization",,"Haack, P.; University of Zurich, Department of Business Administration, Universitátsstrasse 84, 8006 Zurich, Switzerland; email: patrick.haack@uzh.ch",,,01708406,,,,"English","Organ.

From an information processing framework, this research examines the inferences made by children about fruit content in children's food and beverage products. It focuses on food products that are linked to fruit through signals of fruit in the brand name or packaging. Broadly speaking, this research examines the question, ""when exposed to food product brand names and packaging with fruit-like cues, what do children infer about the amount of fruit found in these products?"" Findings illustrate extreme confusion in the marketplace. Research addressing how children perceive brand names and other elements of food packaging is important for brand strategy and public policy. © 2012 The Clute Institute.","Branding; Children; Ethics; Food marketing; Obesity; Packaging",,"Maher, J.

In order to address these gaps, this study examines the impact of EPS use on export goal achievement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) from a developing country, while adopting a four-dimensional view of export performance. Based on a survey of 143 firms in Turkey, the findings suggest that EPS use improves all four export performance dimensions considered, namely, financial, stakeholder relationship, strategic, and organizational learning goal achievements. The article also delineates the performance effects of specific EPS. For example, stakeholder relationship goal achievement is influenced by only one EPS considered, namely, informational materials (e.g., brochures, pamphlets) on exporting.

From Merchant Charity to Corporate Citizenship, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has undergone a lot of change over the past many centuries. Whatever be the nomenclature, the objective remains the same-ensuring the welfare of the society and local community as an important stakeholder of an organization. While many companies use CSR as a strategic tool, many others undertake CSR activities for genuine altruism. In both cases, CSR can be a very powerful tool for inclusive growth-the need of the hour. In this article, an attempt has been made through a mixed method study of proposing a Society and Local Community Welfare Framework. The quantitative data is gathered through an Executive Perception Survey wherein 400 responses from 125 organizations were gained and statistical analyses of the same were undertaken by the author. The qualitative data was gathered through personal interactions with senior management executives from nine eminent corporate organizations across industry categories.

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis relies on a case study and uses qualitative and quantitative data obtained via interviews, employee survey and analysis of documents. The paper focuses on Ecoprint Ltd, a small printing house in Estonia, and analyzes its reactions to the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 in terms of CSR. The authors then analyze the concurrence of these changes with its OC, based on a survey that relies on the Competing Values Framework. Findings: The dominant type of OC in the organization did not predict all its CSR practices, but described rather well how adaptation in the sphere of CSR took place as a result of economic downturn. The case demonstrated that CSR activities that relate to dominant OC types are less likely to be reduced in a recession; moreover, some were even intensified. On the other hand, there were certain CSR activities that reflected less prevalent types of OC, nevertheless these were not withdrawn either. Research limitations/implications: The method used, single case study, serves as an exploratory study. The relationship between unchanged CSR activities related to less dominant OC types is not easy to interpret and needs further investigation. Originality/value: There is abundant literature referring to a connection between OC and CSR, but related empirical research is hard to find.

In this context, different voluntary tools, approaches, and initiatives have been developed by and for corporations to engage with sustainability. However, there has been a lack of clarity in explaining how the initiatives address the different elements of the company system (operations and processes, management and strategy, organisational systems, procurement and marketing, and assessment and communication), how they contribute to sustainability's dimensions (economic, environmental, social, and time), how they are linked, or combined to help leaders better embed sustainability into their company's system. The paper provides an analysis of sixteen of the most widely used initiatives (e.g. life cycle assessment, eco-design, cleaner production, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability reporting). Each initiative was analysed on how it contributes or addresses the four dimensions of sustainability, and the company system. It was found that each initiative has advantages with respect to scope and focus for the sustainability dimensions and the company system's elements, but it has certain disadvantages when it comes to dealing with the complexity and broadness of sustainability. The paper discusses how relying on one initiative can result in a limited and narrow contribution to sustainability and curtail coverage of the company's system. The results indicate that the least addressed elements of the company system have been organisational systems and procurement and marketing. A new framework, the Corporate Integration of Voluntary Initiatives for Sustainability (CIVIS), is proposed with two purposes: (1) to help company leaders better understand how to improve their company's contribution to sustainability, and (2) to foster a holistic approach through the combination of company initiatives that would help to embed sustainability into a company's system with the least effort and maximum results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This discussion is timely given the tensions that currently exist between those who want off-shore outsourcing to continue as a means for increasing international trade, and those who only want to conduct business on-shore. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual approach has been taken in this paper in order to highlight key considerations for ethical decision-making with respect to off-shore outsourcing. Findings: Considerations of selflessness and self-interest are embedded in outsourcing decisions. It is recommended that a balance between making profits and fulfilling social responsibilities is required, ideally, at each stage of decision-making. Hence, managers should think critically about the reasons behind off-shore outsourcing decisions, the process of arriving at decisions, and the impact of their decisions on stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: This is a conceptual paper and further empirical data to validate the stages of decision-making framework are required. Practical implications: Failure to take into account the selflessness and self-interest outcomes of off-shore outsourcing could potentially off-set strategic gains by leading to negative media publicity for a company. Social implications: Ethical considerations as part of outsourcing decisions should result in a transparent, fair and more humane working environment for both the host and the home country representatives involved in the process.

One of the most important factors, however, is the quality of a company's communication, which underscores the strategic role that the investor relations function should play in fostering positive capital market relations. Research limitations/implications: Being explorative in nature, the categories and scales proposed need further validation. Furthermore, in future research, it would be worthwhile to explore not only the role of non-financials in image formation but also the interplay between financials and non-financials in image formation. Practical implications: Investor relations professionals should consider the factors presented in this study in their work in order to ensure that they cater to the actual information needs of capital market participants. The consideration of non-financial factors enhances the quality of financial communications. It also enriches the understanding of the strategic communication tasks of the investor relations department. Originality/value: This paper describes an empirical analysis of the management of corporate relationships with financial audiences, a stakeholder group increasingly focused on by communications research. It represents a contribution to the further establishment of investor relations as a strategic communication function. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Corporate image; Equity analysts; Image; Investor relations; Non-financials; Reports",,"Fieseler, C.; Institute for Media and Communications Management, University of St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; email: christian.fieseler@unisg.ch",,,13563289,,,,"English","Corp.

Here we develop a theoretical perspective that explicitly focuses on irresponsibility and that particularly helps explain attributions of social irresponsibility in the minds of the firm's observers. In contrast to approaches in the corporate social responsibility literature that tend to deemphasize the role of the individual perceiver of firm behavior in favor of emphasizing such broader social structures as value systems, institutions, and stakeholder relations, our focus is on how the social reality of external expectations for social responsibility is rooted in the perceptions of the beholder. We draw on attribution theory to describe how attributions of irresponsibility stem from the observer's subjective assessments of effect undesirability, corporate culpability, and affected party noncomplicity. We describe how those assessments affect each other and how they are influenced by the observer's perceptions of effect and firm characteristics and by the observer's social identification with the affected party or the implicated corporation. We conclude by describing the important role of frames on irresponsibility attributions. © 2012 Academy of Management Review.",,,"Lange, D.; W. P.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a quantitative analysis approach. It examines the 2008 annual reports of the largest 100 Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to determine the amount of environmental reporting - these data are compared with various corporate governance measures. Findings: Analysis found a significant positive relationship between the extent of environmental reporting and the proportions of independent and female directors on a board. The analysis did not, however, support a negative relationship between the extent of environmental reporting and institutional investors and board size as has been previously predicted, rather, it showed a positive relationship. Originality/value: This paper offers insights to both regulators and company strategists. Regulators such as the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) could consider expanding its Corporate Governance Council guidelines to include consideration of the environment, which is increasingly considered to be an important aspect of corporate social responsibility, and one of the responsibilities of the board of directors. In addition, for companies which include a commitment to the environment in their mission and strategies, it suggests consideration of the impact of board structure and composition is important as both of these are shown to have a significant effect on the amount of environmental information disclosed by companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Corporate governance; Corporate strategy; Environmental reporting",,"Tilt, C.

This paper builds on a normative ethical framework, labeled the integrative justice model (IJM) for impoverished markets that was introduced in the marketing and public policyliterature. Specifically, the paper will extend the normative ethics of the IJM by proposing logically reasoned decision principles for managers, particularly in MNC subsidiaries, that might better shape ethical business strategy when targeting impoverished segments. Additionally, numerous case examples are given to illustrate how a number of these decision principles are already being applied by companies around the world.

Design/methodology/approach: A scenario-based experiment with 331 business professionals was conducted and three regression models were run to test three hypotheses proposed in the paper. Findings: The norm of reciprocity reduces decision-making agents' tendency to lay off employees in the face of an environmental change. In addition, the norm of reciprocity interacts with decision-making agents' conscientiousness in influencing their layoff decision.

It respects cultural differences and aims to identify the business opportunities in building the skills of employees, the community and the government. In talking about social responsibility, major attention has been drawn to CSR, yet little has been mentioned on how university stakeholders such as students can contribute to developing social responsibility. It can be said that the society of tomorrow begins today, and to make up this society, universities need to have drive, patience, and persistence to help them achieve the related goals. It is crucial for learning institutions to develop ways in which to cope with the present context demands, not only in terms of returns to the community in the form of community engagement involvement through student projects, but also in the sense of replenishing their own actions and enlarging their sources or references, so as to become institutions that help with and are partially involved in shaping a new society that is more ethical and is engaged with its community and surroundings. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines the university social responsibility (USR) initiative of 14 public and private higher learning institutions in Malaysia. Data were collected from 150 respondents using the quantitative method through survey questionnaires. Samples were selected based on the purposive sampling method, where the respondents were majoring in communication or had taken media studies. Questions took the form of open and closed-ended questions. The data gathered were then analyzed quantitatively by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Version 15). Findings: The results show that, overall, respondents are aware of the need to preserve the environment and the function and role that CSR plays in developing a more responsive public. However, the discovered lack of exposure to activities that the respondents can participate in on their own needs to be addressed. Knowledge on environmental conservation or CSR contribution may not be indicative of high levels of practice. There are many other factors that can contribute to better practices or to a lifestyle that better favors environmental conservation. Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach and limitations in terms of time, this study does not analyze and verify the links that exist between CSR and the environment with relation to government policy. Practical implications: Most existing research in CSR fails to take into account how universities cope with the development of CSR. Therefore, efforts to understand CSR within the university setting are significant for the development of CSR practices and conduct. Originality/value: Value from this paper is derived in three ways: first, it outlines why universities in Malaysia should move forward in determining the most relevant paths for social responsibility engagement and initiatives; second, it provides an understanding of the setting of CSR, making it easier for graduates to implement CSR at the organization they work for in the future; and finally, the data and implications drawn from Malaysia add a necessary international insight into the benefits of CSR at university level. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Community engagement; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management; Higher learning institution; Social responsibility; Sustainable development; Universities",,"Ahmad, J.; School of Communication, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia; email: jahmad@usm.my",,,17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

It also seeks to investigate the importance the entrepreneurs place on CSR, their understanding of stakeholders, the types of CSR activities undertaken by them, and the issue of social capital. Design/methodology/ approach: Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews with Sri Lankan entrepreneurs based in Victoria, Australia. Findings: The interviewees were aware of the term CSR but, nevertheless, had different interpretations of its meaning. However, CSR was considered important and all the interviewees were, in some way, involved in CSR activities and also had a good understanding of the importance of their stakeholders. Findings also highlighted the significance attached to social capital by the entrepreneurs such as informal relationships and trustworthiness which build the intangible attributes of CSR. The present findings can be attributed to immigrant entrepreneurs behaving partly to adapt to the host country, by changing their beliefs, values, traditions and partly by being influenced by their home country culture as found in the extended part of this current study.

Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a combined qualitative methodology of interviews with managers and employees on all levels of the organization; participant observations of formal meetings, company events and informal gatherings; and document evaluation. Findings: This paper shows how the CSR program is purposefully and rationally designed to meet the standards of a business case approach to CSR and that, accordingly, company managers integrate it into the activities of departments and divisions such as sales, marketing, and human resources (HR).

Design/methodology/approach: The study, done during June through October of 2009, utilized a qualitative method. The data were acquired through questionnaires, industry visits, interviews and management manuals. Findings: The results indicate a strong inclination toward a management of quality control, food security and environment with lower priority given to social responsibility. The results also suggest that the CSR concept is not fully understood among the companies studied. Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted at five fish processing companies. Caution is required in generalizing these results to other fish companies located in other countries. Practical implications: In view of the positive results in the areas of economic (quality control and food safety) and environmental management the next step would be to become socially responsible by developing its social resources (work safety, health, and a polity of human rights). Originality/value: The study provides an analysis of fish processing companies that have already implemented an integrated management system which includes a well defined and ample concept of CSR.

Design/methodology/ approach - This study uses a mail survey and employs structural equation modeling to test the different relationships among the constructs examined. By testing the fitness of the competing model models, the appropriate relationships are identified. Findings - The environmental performance is directly influenced by instrumental motives and political motives, which have indirect effects on environmental performance through corporate environmental responsibility. These also reveal that instrumental motives have marginal effects on both corporate environmental responsibility and environmental performance, and the marginal effects of political motives on environmental performance are also clearly shown. Notably, the results reveal that the corporate environmental responsibly is a pivot in these cause-effect relationships. Research limitations/ implications - Although this study provides researchers and policy makers with a framework to study environmental responsibility in different business environments, it did not undertake a deeper analysis to better understand business and organizational cultures and business environments regarding the implementation of an environmentally oriented policy. Furthermore, the model was only tested with survey data from Taiwan, although some of samples operate internationally. Practical implications - From the perspective of a practical business context, practitioners should implement corporate responsibility policies that are specifically related to their political environments. For example, when doing businesses in Taiwan, the political motives involved in environmental protection will be the key to success when undertaking policies related to corporate environmental responsibility. Originality/value - The results of this research indicate that there is an indirect heavy loading of corporate environmental responsibility on environmental performance. Therefore, corporate environmental responsibility is the pivotal factor in firms' adoption of environmentally oriented policies. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Audits offer a tool through which to shape and regulate corporate social performance (CSP). Where audits have limited value is in their ability to stimulate internal engagement around social and organizational norms and principles, as the process relies on auditors to generate performance data against pre-selected indicators. Data is then utilized to produce a measure of risk or effectiveness through which to demonstrate compliance. Focusing on the internal organizational aspects of accountability and the processes, mechanisms and methodologies used to establish critical reflection, three alternatives within the current audit regime are presented. These forms of 'new accounting' stand in contrast to conventional auditing, as their focus is on building cross-functional connections and collaborative internal relationships that are based on dialogue and mutual exchange about the problems and possibilities of CSR implementation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It explores the suitability of CSR for addressing social, environmental and economic issues associated with mining in the country. The study is based on interviews with four stakeholder groups in the country: government, civil society, international financial organisations, and mining industry. These are analysed using content and interpretative techniques and supplemented by the content analysis of secondary data from headquarters of mining MNCs. Using the concept of corporate social responsibility orientation (CSRO), the study contrasts the perceptions of major stakeholders and examines adaptation of mining companies' CSRO to local context. It reveals that the CSRO of mining managers in Argentina differs from CSRO developed by global headquarters; and in Argentina companies ""negotiate"" economic, environmental and legal dimensions of CSR with the government. Although companies ""negotiate"" philanthropic responsibilities with the communities, ethical responsibilities are defined by the headquarters and not negotiated locally. The analysis suggests that environmental duties are the critical element of CSR in the mining sector in Argentina.

This question will always prove contentious. First, the impacts differ according to context. Second, the social consequences and spillover effects of knowledge diffusion and technology-sharing may be limited and hard to measure. Third, contributions to enhancing social responsibility and improving living standards in host countries are delayed in effect, causally complex, and also hard to measure. Outcomes often critically depend on collaboration of governments, international institutions, the business world, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Research in this area is challenging and requires interdisciplinary collaboration between economists, financial experts, sociologists, ethicists, and other specialists. This paper explores: (1) the evidence to support the proposition that FDI and international business improve social conditions in less-developed countries, and: (2) how these improvements are linked to strategies of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ethical business practice. The paper draws insights from development, FDI, poverty alleviation, and bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) literature. Applications are demonstrated using examples from poverty-stricken areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper attempts not only to argue theoretically but also to provide practical evidence. The approach is simultaneously descriptive, analytical, and prescriptive in order to address a wide audience. It also highlights issues and trends for further academic research and presents the viewpoint that some limitations lie in the nature of ethics frameworks widely referenced in business and that these often fail to consider the compatibility of ethical constructs with relevant incentives. In this vein, we explore the application of Homann's framework for advantage and incentive-based ethics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bottom of the pyramid; Corporate responsibility; Foreign direct investment; Lecturing business ethics; Sub-Saharan Africa; Transition economies",,"Bardy, R.; BardyConsult, Mannheim, Germany; email: rbardy@t-online.de",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Findings: The research proposes that the owner/managers' values, market pressures and laws are key drivers for CSR in the SMEs context. Managers expect positive outcomes when CSR is implemented. However, the data suggest that while proactive and consistent SMEs may build up a good image and strong positioning, reactive and opportunistic firms may be penalised by stakeholders (e.g. customers).

Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model is proposed, based on previous research, which explains the effect of functional fit and image fit on altruistic attributions, brand credibility and CSR image; these relationships were assessed through structural equation modelling. The model was estimated with a sample of 299 Spanish consumers of toiletries and cosmetics products, randomly selected. Two newly created, printed CBA advertisements served as the basic stimulus of the study. Findings: This research shows that consumers perceive functional and image fit differently, and each has its own mechanism for influencing brand CSR perception. While functional fit has a direct, although gentle influence on CSR perception, image fit has an indirect influence, as it is used as a cue to evaluate altruistic brand motivations and brand credibility. Research limitations/implications: The chosen research approach may reduce the generalisability of the results. Further empirical testing using alternative brands and outcome measures is encouraged. Practical implications: Both types of fit influence the formation of CSR perception, and should therefore be postulated as decision criteria to brand managers for choosing the CBA partner. Specifically, brands which are likely of being perceived as not credible or egoistic when associating with the cause, must pay special attention to image fit. Originality/value: This work analyses and compares simultaneously the influence of functional fit and image fit on CSR brand perception formation in the context of a CBA strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Altruistic attributions; Brand credibility; Brand image; Brand management; Brands corporate social responsibility consumer perception; Functional fit; Image fit",,"Bigné, E.; Department of Marketing, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain; email: enrique.bigne@uv.es",,,03090566,,,,"English","Eur.

Our findings show that CSR toward each of the stakeholder groups has a positive impact on global BE. In addition, global brands that follow local social responsibility policies in communities obtain strong positive benefits through the generation of BE, enhancing the positive effects of CSR toward other stakeholders, particularly customers.

We add to this growing stream of research by investigating how MNEs' social conduct in their emerging economy subsidiaries relates to their relationships with certain local stakeholders in the respective countries. Using stakeholder theory and the concept of local legitimacy, we argue that employees and the local governments are among the forces that drive firms to push for high standards in their working conditions and to engage in developing the local community. Further, we hypothesize that such efforts positively affect the performance of the subsidiary's employees and its relationship with local authorities. To test our hypotheses, we conduct a large-scale, cross-industry analysis using data from 213 MNE subsidiaries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that MNEs' local mid-level employees drive corporate social efforts and also positively react to the corporate social engagement of their employer. In contrast, local governments do not have a significant influence on MNEs' social strategies. Their support of the firm may increase, however, as a result of the firm's active development of the local community. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Emerging economies; Local legitimacy; Multinational enterprise (MNE); Stakeholder theory",,"Reimann, F.; International Business, WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management, Burgplatz 2, 56179 Vallendar, Germany; email: felix.reimann@whu.edu",,,10754253,,JIMAF,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: Using archival data from a sample of Fortune 500 US firms operating in industries subject to both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) TRI program and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Hazard Communication Standards, the authors conduct quantitative threshold tests to first investigate whether disclosure appears to be a function of the materiality of the spending. Using statistical tests, including multiple regression analyses, the authors next attempt to differentiate the choice to disclose across voluntary disclosure theory and legitimacy theory arguments. Findings: First, the authors find that, for the overwhelming majority of observations, the disclosed amounts are not quantitatively material. This suggests that non-disclosure is likely due to immateriality. Next, their findings show that disclosing firms do not exhibit improved subsequent environmental performance relative to non-disclosing companies. Further, controlling for firm size and industry class, they find the choice to disclose is associated with worse environmental performance. Research limitations/implications: The sample includes only relatively larger firms from certain industries and this limits the generalizability of the findings. Smaller firms and those from excluded industries may have other reasons to choose to disclose environmental information. Further, the authors rely on TRI data to assess pollution performance, but TRI is self-reported and its reliability is only as good as the inputs. Finally, although environmental capital spending is potentially relevant information, this investigation does not examine other types of environmental information disclosure. Practical implications: This paper provides corroborating evidence that companies use the disclosure of environmental capital spending as a strategic tool to address their exposures to political and regulatory concerns. Hence, interpreting disclosed environmental information would appear to require careful understanding of the underlying motivations. Originality/value: This paper extends the environmental accounting and reporting literature by contributing to the unresolved question of what drives differences in the corporate disclosure of environmental information.

We also propose that CSRs be reconceptualized in terms of the ways that managers enable stakeholders to hold themselves and each other responsible for the ways their actions affect each other as they conduct business through the firm. In this article, we propose a new view of corporations and responsibility that reconstrues behavior currently referred to as CSR. Starting with an overview of theories of the firm, we show that the way in which a firm is conceived yields different views on CSR. A shortcoming of the theory of the firm approach to CSR is that it leads us to focus excessively on business corporations at the expense of a broader analysis of other institutional players. These theories also tend to emphasize the obligations of corporations to people rather than of people to each other. We propose that social responsibility be viewed through a systems theory paradigm instead. We then argue that corporations should be construed in terms of the people who impact them.

Greater scrutiny of NGO spending driven by self-appointed watchdogs of the nonprofit sector and a prevalence of strategic notions of CSR advanced by corporate actors weaken the ability of civil society actors to change the business practices of their partners in the commercial sector. To counter this trend, we argue that corporations should embrace a political notion of CSR and should actively encourage NGOs to strengthen ""downward accountability"" mechanisms, even if this creates more tensions in corporate-NGO partnerships. Rather than seeing NGOs as tools in a competition for a comparative advantage in the market place, corporations should actively support NGO independence and critical capacity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accountability; Co-optation; CSR; NGO-business partnerships; NGOs; Watchdogs",,"Baur, D.; Institute for Business Ethics, University of St. Gallen, Tannenstrasse 19, CH-9000 St. Gallen, Switzerland; email: dorothea.baur@unisg.ch",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Five business impacts were measured-job satisfaction, morale, organizational pride, belief in UL mission, and engagement. Using an employee survey, the research team compared signature program volunteers with others and found a positive correlation between volunteering and impacts on morale, organizational pride, belief in UL mission, and engagement. Employee awareness (without participation) of UL signature programs was also associated with increased morale and organizational pride. While the study did not prove causation, it confirmed previous research on the link between employee volunteering and positive HR outcomes.

This study follows earlier studies of nonfinancial disclosures of governance and corporate social responsibility information (Holder-Webb et al. 2008, 2009) and examines the public voluntary disclosure of a set of leading indicators of economic performance and sustainability of earnings provided during 2004 by a sample of 50 publicly traded firms across five industries. The results indicate that, among the sample firms, there remains a lack of rigorous and expansive disclosure of this type of information and that considerable variability exists in disclosure practice based on both industry and size. For example, companies disclose a wide variety of nonfinancial information both through mandatory filings such as 10-Ks and through alternative sources such as investor promotion materials and company websites, with the most frequent types of disclosures being concerned with information pertaining to market share and innovation. We conclude by discussing the role of this study within recent developments in integrative reporting (Adams et al. 2011) and suggest that these types of disclosures would benefit from the availability of assurance services.","Competitiveness information; Content analysis; Corporate disclosure; Integrative reporting; Leading indicators; Nonfinancial information",,"Cohen, J.

Corporations in fulfilling their CR are anticipated to function within the framework of the laws and regulations as part of the legal responsibility. Having a good law that upholds human rights has been seen as a vital tool in promoting and improving the public image of a corporation in the eyes of their customers. In the area of consumer protection and contract law, the Malaysian contract law has not been a great champion of consumer rights vis-à-vis suppliers and manufacturers. Standard form contracts have come to dominate more than just routine transactions between suppliers and consumers. The increasing use of exemption clauses in consumer standard form contracts has now become a predominant feature of many consumer contracts. In view of increasing unethical conduct by manufacturers, consumer rights vis-à-vis manufacturers have also been a cause for concern. The absence of a contractual relationship between manufacturers and consumers has to an extent provided a good defence for escaping liability for defective goods by the manufacturers. The consumer rights, being the rights of third parties, have never been acknowledged under the Malaysian law of contract. Adopting the content analysis method, this paper aims at exploring CR vis-à-vis consumers in three selected areas of consumer and contract law, namely, the use of standard form contracts in consumer contracts, the exemption of liabilities for defective goods by traders and the rights of consumers against manufacturers under the Malaysian contract and consumer law regime. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Consumer protection law; Contract law; Corporate responsibility; Exemption clause; Standard form contract; Third party rights",,"Yusoff, S.S.A.; Faculty of Law, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; email: kinasay@ukm.my",,,01287702,,,,"English","Pertanika J.

However, this approach is inappropriate since concrete action and experience in engineering contexts seldom meets the criteria of our traditional moral theories. Technological action is often distributed rather than individual or collective, we lack full control of the technology and its consequences, and we lack knowledge and are uncertain about these consequences. In this paper, I analyse these problems by employing Kierkegaardian notions of tragedy and moral responsibility in order to account for experiences of the tragic in technological action. I argue that ascription of responsibility in engineering contexts should be sensitive to personal experiences of lack of control, uncertainty, role conflicts, social dependence, and tragic choice. I conclude that this does not justify evading individual and corporate responsibility, but inspires practices of responsibility ascription that are less 'harsh' on those directly involved in technological action, that listen to their personal experiences, and that encourage them to gain more knowledge about what they are doing. © 2010 The Author(s).","Deepwater Horizon; Engineering; Kierkegaard; Moral responsibility; Technology; Tragedy","article; business ethics; decision making; disaster; engineering; ethics; human; morality; oil spill; professional standard; social behavior; technology; uncertainty; Choice Behavior; Disasters; Engineering; Ethics, Business; Humans; Moral Obligations; Petroleum Pollution; Professional Role; Social Behavior; Technology; Uncertainty","Coeckelbergh, M.; Department of Philosophy, University of Twente, Postbus 217, 7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; email: m.coeckelbergh@utwente.nl",,,13533452,,,20862561,"English","Sci.

Design/methodology/approach: A preliminary case study of an Irish NPO/public sector hybrid organisation was used to ground a review of NPO and public sector performance management concepts and theoretical developments. The review focused on the implications of organisational characteristics/attributes of the hybrid case study organisation for performance management. Findings: Five organisational characteristics/attributes are identified as central to the understanding of the challenges for performance management in such settings: inter-stakeholder relationships; tensions across priority objectives; culture and institutional clashes; power distribution; and interdependent stress. Further, it is suggested that while the adoption of collaborative public sector models suggests a move toward performance governance, the performance challenges identified in the hybrid setting give rise to particular barriers to any substantive movement in that direction. Originality/value: Performance of NPO/public sector hybrid organisations has only relatively recently attracted the attention of researchers. The paper contributes to this emerging area by identifying certain organisational characteristics/attributes particular to such hybrids that are critical to understanding the challenges for performance management in such settings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Disability services; Hybrid organizations; Ireland; Non-profit organizations; Performance governance; Performance Management; Public sector organizations",,"Conaty, F.

Since then an impressive body of empirical data and theory-building has been amassed, mainly located in the fields of management studies and business ethics. One of the most noteworthy recent conceptual contributions to the scholarship is Midttun's (Corporate Governance 5(3):159-174, 2005) CSR-oriented embedded relational model of societal governance. It re-conceptualises the relationships between the state, business, and civil society. Other scholars (In Albareda et al. Corporate Governance 6(4):386-400, 2006; Business Ethics: A European Review 17(4):347-363, 2008; Lozano et al., Governments and Corporate Social Responsibility, 2008) have recently successfully used the model as the basis for their analytical framework for researching CSR activities in a large number of western European countries. While this research offers valuable insights into how CSR is operationalised, it also suffers from a number of significant limitations. To develop a stronger analytical framework with which to explore CSR, this article draws more deeply on political science literature concerned with governance and public policy analysis. This represents the main purpose of this article. In addition, this article also addresses a second and more modest aim: to reflect on the ways in which relational governance-inspired frameworks could be adapted and applied to politico-economic systems where state-industry-third sector relations differ from those found in North America and Western Europe.

A luxury brand's self-enhancement concept (i.e., dominance over people and resources) is in conflict with the CSR information's self-transcendence concept (i.e., protecting the welfare of all), which causes disfluency and a decline in evaluations. These effects do not emerge for brands with openness (i.e., following emotional pursuits in uncertain directions) or conservation (i.e., protecting the status quo) concepts that do not conflict with CSR. The effects for luxury brand concepts disappeared when the informativeness of the disfluency was undermined but were accentuated in an abstract (vs. concrete) mind-set. These findings implicate brand concepts as a key factor in how consumers respond to CSR activities. © 2011 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.",,,"Torelli, C.

Design/methodology/approach: This study summarizes the concepts of CSR and green management to develop an integral framework to enhance green intellectual capital. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to verify the research framework.

Bad reputations stemming from environmental disasters and social disharmony led mining multinationals to adopt CSR policies and improve their practices. Rationalist expectations about what is driving firm responses to external pressures are a necessary, but insufficient, explanation of how and why mining companies have sought to improve their reputations. Three elements are necessary to explain firm responses, including strategic adaptation to external pressures, learning processes associated with CSR, and internalization of sustainable development norms, understood as standards of appropriate behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a multidisciplinary theoretical framework for explaining the adoption of CSR policies and practices on the part of mining companies, and applies that framework to case studies of two major mining companies with global operations. Findings: An account of learning processes and norms socialization as they relate to CSR provide a more comprehensive explanation of how and why mining companies adopt CSR policies. Incorporation of these elements provides a better explanation of why mining companies began to frame their CSR policies in terms of the global norm of sustainable development.

People expect specific behavior from an organization regarding societal issues or questions, and when an organization ignores or denigrates issues and in the worst case contributes to making conditions worse, stakeholders will react. The purpose of this paper is to propose the PZB model of service quality as a tool that organizations can use to align expectations and perceptions with organizational behavior and communication. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides two cases of the use of CSR communication as a marketing mechanism to position an entity as environmentally friendly. In both instances, the messages were declared illegal and had to be removed. The PZB model of service and the co-orientation model are used to illustrate the principles discussed. Findings: The cases illustrate the need for organizations to not only be more aware of the expectations of their stakeholders but also to implement organizational practices that ensure they are abreast of expectations and operate accordingly. Practical implications: The value of the paper is that it provides organizations with a proven tool that can be used not only for customers but for other stakeholders as well. Its real strength, however, is that it provides guidelines for internally- as well as externally oriented behavior and communication.

Unfortunately, CSP has largely been employed as a way of demonstrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) in practice, or to justify the business case for CSR in academia by relating some measure of CSP to some measure of financial performance. In this article, we discuss multiple shortcomings to these approaches. We argue that (1) CSR activities need to be managed and measured as projects and aggregated to the business or corporate level using a project portfolio; (2) appropriate measures need to be identified that move away from reporting the firm's activities toward quantifying actual social outcomes achieved; and (3) given the types of projects prevalent in CSR, statistical evaluation methods common in other fields (ideally, pre-test post-test control group designs, such as used in medicine or propensity score matching for ongoing or past projects) should be employed to properly measure outcomes. We make a first, albeit imperfect, attempt at using such an approach with data collected on behalf of the Patrimonio Hoy project, a well-publicized CSR initiative carried out by Cemex in Mexico.

The propositions have been verified with the use of empirical data available in the literature. The data supports the propositions that CRM influences elements of competitiveness like brand image, customer loyalty and market results. The studies of stakeholders' expectations indicate that they exert pressure on companies to follow the principles of corporate social responsibility.

Since the corporations use the resources from within the society, their continued existence not only depends on the sustainability of these resources but also their acceptance of accountability for sustaining them.

Proactive CSR has been less researched in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) compared to large firms; and, whether SMEs are ideally placed to gain competitive advantage through such activity therefore remains a point of debate. This study examines empirically the association between three specified capabilities (shared vision, stakeholder management and strategic proactivity), proactive CSR and financial performance in SMEs. Using quantitative data collected from a sample of 171 SMEs in the machinery and equipment sector of the Australian manufacturing industry, we find that all specified capabilities are positively associated with adoption of proactive CSR by SMEs, and that proactive CSR is, in turn, associated with an improvement in firm financial performance. Evidence of a fully mediating role for proactive CSR on the association between capabilities and financial performance presented in this study aligns with RBV theory that suggests adoption of value-creating strategies that make the most effective use of a firm's capabilities is essential to financial success.

Methodology/approach - The chapter engages a participant observational method set within an interpretivist methodology. The data generated take the form of vignettes which are used to explore the issues. Findings - The discussion and argument demonstrate that while much worthwhile attention has been paid to the macro aspects and dimensions of corporate social responsibility, less scrutiny has been focused on the myriad micro-moments that operate to ultimately create macro-settings. The chapter illustrates the nature of micro-moments and shows their interactive nature combined with their consequences and implications for building corporately social irresponsible or corporately social responsible environments. Research limitations/implications - The chapter underlines the vital role of micro-moments for corporate social responsibility. The data consist of a number of vignettes which illustrate a particular circumscribed setting. As is commonly the case with inductive research, further work, mindful of on-going reliability and validity measures, will be required to assess the generalisability of the findings across other sectors and organisations. Practical implications - The chapter affords people working in organisations the opportunity to reflect on their actions in the micro-moment and scale them towards corporately social responsible outcomes. Social implications - Improvement of micro-moment interactions should work to improve corporate social responsibility across a range of organisational settings.

Foreign affiliates may be able to improve their social legitimacy and overcome LOF by demonstrating social commitment to host-country constituents through corporate social responsibility (CSR). If LOF is positively related to the distance between the home and host countries, and CSR activities confer social legitimacy benefits on foreign affiliates, we should expect CSR activities and distance to be positively related. However, we argue that, despite this potential motivation, foreign affiliates from more distant home countries are in fact less likely to engage in host-country CSR. Our argument focuses on the ways in which distance affects the MNE's willingness and ability to engage in CSR abroad. We also predict that host-country CSR reputation negatively moderates this relationship. Using Community Reinvestment Act data for foreign bank affiliates from 32 countries in the United States over 1990-2007, we find strong support for our hypotheses.

The three main arguments of the paper are as follows. First, classic CSR literature was more pluralistic in terms of background political theories than many later texts. Second, instrumental CSR adopted classical liberalism and libertarian laissez-faire as its structural logic. Third, new political CSR, based on a strong globalist transition of responsibilities and tasks from governments to companies, lacks a conceptualization of division of moral labor that is needed to fully depart from a classical liberalist position.

Our study reveals that CSR was not widely used in textile industries in either China or Brazil. However, Brazilian firms have many more CSR practices in place than Chinese firms suggesting that the country where a firm is located strongly influences CSR adoption. Firm size and position in the value chain also exert significant influence but to a lesser extent than the country variable. We argue that the CSR differences between countries result from the unique historical evolution of their national business systems. This together with the institutional framework of a country affect CSR approaches. In the case of textile firms, coercive isomorphism plays a dominant role in legitimizing CSR. The more transparent and rule-based governance system in Brazil explains the more comprehensive CSR practices. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methodology/approach - The chapter develops Marx's understanding of the twin pressures of class struggle and inter-capitalist competition in setting the limits of agency for corporate actors. It is thus theoretical and discursive in nature. Findings - The findings of the chapter suggest that the scope for corporate agency in relation to responsibility/irresponsibility is severely limited by inter-capitalist competition and capitalist social relations. It therefore argues that those interested in social justice and environmental sustainability should focus on these structural pressures rather than theorizing corporate agency. Social implications - The research suggests that the focus of academic and government attention should be on resolving the contradictions and exploitative social relations inherent in capitalism. Without this emphasis activism, corporate agency and government action will not eradicate the types of problem that advocates of CSR/CSI are concerned about. Originality/value of paper - The value of the paper is that it contests and engages critically with the utility of the notion of CSR and the emergent concept of CSI. It asks proponents of these concepts to think seriously about the structural pressures and constraints within which business and policy makers act.

The survey was conducted in Estonian, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Slovakian, Czech, Finnish and German electric-electronic machine, retail store and machine-building enterprises.The Schumpeterian definition (Shumpeter, 1934) of innovation states that the commercialization of all new combinations is based upon the application of any of the following: new materials and components, the introduction of new processes, the opening of new markets, and the introduction of new organizational forms. According to Janszen (2000) when a change in technology is involved it is termed an ""invention"" and when the business world is involved, it is an ""innovation"" (Janszen, 2000). Different organizations have different definitions about CSR, but there is similar ground between them (Übius & Alas 2009; Tafel-Viia & Alas 2009). Today leaders face a challenge in order to apply societal ethical standards to responsible business practice (Morimoto et al., 2005) during changes triggered by changing environment (Alas 2008; Alas et al 2009a; Alas et al 2009b; Alas et al 2010; Sepper & Alas 2008) and taking place in different cultures (Alas & Edwards 2011; Alas et al 2011). Corporate social responsibility is regarded as a crucially important issue in management nowadays (Cornelius et al., 2008; Humphreys & Brown, 2008).The previous research study’s findings of no significant differences by the entrepreneur’s gender in venture innovation/risk situation, in strategies employed, and in satisfaction with performance support other recent research studies (Sonfield & Lussier, 1997). Recent evidences showed that the relationship between organizational commitment and discretionary measures of corporate social orientation is stronger for women than for men (Peterson, 2004) and that corporate charitable behavior, which is considered to be discretionary (Carroll, 1979) is viewed more favorably by women than men (Roberts, 1993).Linear regression analysis was done in order to analyze connections between innovation climate and corporate social responsibility. Data about three different age groups, two different genders and two different education levels were compared by means of the T-test and ANOVA-test. The total number of respondents was 6094.The results of an empirical study show that corporate social responsibility predicts innovation climate but it depends on the employees` gender, age and education level. From this study corporate social responsibility predicts innovation climate among younger and middle age groups. One facet of corporate social responsibility – the firm performance concerning social issues predicts innovation climate among older age group. Corporate social responsibility predicts also innovation climate among men. Corporate social responsibility predicts innovation climate among respondents with high level of education. One facet of corporate social responsibility - the firm performance concerning social issues predicts innovation climate among respondents with low level of education.Both facets of corporate social responsibility and innovation climate were rated higher among women and lower among men. Both facets of corporate social responsibility and innovation climate were rated higher among younger age group and lower among middle and older age group. There weren’t big differences among respondents with low and high levels of education according to the two facets of corporate social responsibility - the firm performance concerning social issues and the firm respects the interests of agents and innovation climate. © 2012, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

In this study, the authors propose that the relationship between firm size and CSP is mediated by outside director representation in the board. The authors tested the mediating effect using a data set of 180 Korean firms and found empirical support for the argument. The result indicates that a firm's social performance is more directly influenced by internal responses, such as appointing more outside directors in this study, rather than firm size.

Our goal is to find distinct profiles of credit institutions, depending on their degree of concern about CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). The field work was conducted by means of a survey answered by 57 Spanish credit institutions. The results show the interest of such institutions in CSR in relation to the entire Spanish financial sector. Three clusters are distinguished according to how they think about CSR. In the first cluster there are institutions with responsibility focused on employees. It includes entities whose priority stakeholders are shareholders and employees. In the second cluster, we find institutions with responsibility focused on society. Among the stakeholders they act primarily towards customers, society and the environment. The third cluster is made up of institutions with responsibility focused on legislation (norms).

Consequently we emphasize that for managing innovation processes for sustainability and their institutional context, the food sustainability discourse also needs to investigate the state of the art of CSR in agribusiness. Based on a model to compare and contrast accountability standards we analyse the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) platform and its principles. We conclude that over the past 5 years agribusiness corporations have become more pro-active in addressing sustainability concerns, and mainstream initiatives start to compete with the traditional niche markets. The SAI was founded by three big players in the food industry, and represents a global initiative among a number of private-sector driven institutional innovations for the sustainability transformation of the mainstream parts of the sector.

The objective of the present study is to examine the role Spain's savings banks play in international cooperation and development as a field that society and the general public see as ever more crucial. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes an exploratory analysis of the interventions carried out by all Spain's savings banks during 2009. Findings: The results of this exploratory study reflect an increasingly relevant role of these savings banks in cooperation for development, mainly due to pressure from their customers and from society in general. They also show the importance of so-called ""Works in collaboration"", mainly with non-governmental organizations/non-governmental development organizations, in designing and implementing corporate social responsibility programs.

It seeks to demonstrate that international corporate culture precludes ethical decision-making and practices by placing would-be ethical actors in untenable situations. Methodology/approach - A case study approach is adopted. It analyses various lawsuits brought against Talisman by the Presbyterian Church of Sudan, who claim that Talisman aided and abetted the government of Sudan in genocide during the various protracted conflicts of a violent civil war. Findings - By reviewing Talisman's corporate social responsibility reports, we find that locating corporate charters in the hands of nationstates entails an inherent tension that can only be resolved by either implementing an international corporate charter in the case of multinationals, or abandoning the corporate charter altogether Practical implications - We argue for immediate application of the International Criminal Court in The Hague against corporate enablers of government violence against its peoples. Originality/value - In the case of Talisman in the Sudan, international corporate culture and lack of support from its operating partners did more than discourage Talisman from implementing ethical practices; it prevented Talisman from acting ethically.

Democratic legitimacy is typically concerned with input legitimacy (rule credibility, or the extent to which the regulations are perceived as justified) and output legitimacy (rule effectiveness, or the extent to which the rules effectively solve the issues). In this study, we identify MSI input legitimacy criteria (inclusion, procedural fairness, consensual orientation, and transparency) and those of MSI output legitimacy (rule coverage, efficacy, and enforcement), and discuss their implications for MSI democratic legitimacy. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Corporate social responsibility; Deliberative democracy; Legitimacy; Multi-stakeholder initiative; Soft law",,"Mena, S.; University of LausanneUnited States",,"Cambridge University Press",1052150X,,,,"English","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 119 medium and large-sized organisations (over 100 employees) in Lithuania was conducted to study CSR and HRM implementation in the country and to test the relationship between CSR, HRM and organisational performance outcomes. Findings: In total, 78.1 per cent of the respondent organisations have a written or unwritten HR strategy. Only 38.8 per cent have a CSR statement, but more than half of respondent organisations have a code of ethics, corporate values statement and diversity statement (respectively 65.4, 63.0 and 53.1 per cent). Research findings show that there is a linkage between HRM, CSR and performance outcomes - organisations with more developed HRM, i.e. those where HRM performs a strategic role and the HR function performance is evaluated, have better developed CSR policies. The latter were found to have an impact on organisational and financial performance outcomes. Research limitations/implications: The study is built on the Cranet survey data, therefore not all CSR-related HRM practices are analysed. Due to a limited number of organisations using CSR-related HRM practices, the statistical analysis fails to determine statistically significant relationships between the usage of those practices, the level of CSR development and performance outcomes. Practical implications: Organisations that are socially responsible and follow a strategic approach to HRM exhibit better performance outcomes, profitability in particular. Originality/value: The paper confirms the existence of the HRM-CSR-performance linkage, i.e. organisations with better developed HRM, where HR plays a more strategic role and its performance is more evaluated, also have more developed formal CSR policies, which in turn has a positive impact on organisational and financial performance outcomes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business strategy; Corporate social responsibility; Human resource management; Lithuania; Organizational performance",,"Bučiuniene, I.; HRM Program, ISM University of Management and EconomicsLithuania; email: ilobuc@ism.lt",,,17465265,,,,"English","Baltic J.

The traditional high ranking accorded the US is largely attributable to fallacies, poor science and ideology. The ideological bias finds expression in two ways: the inclusion of indices that do not provide competitive advantage, but that fit the Anglo/US ideology; and the exclusion of indices that are known to offer competitive advantage, but that do not fit the Anglo/US ideology. This flaw is compounded by methodological problems that raise further doubt as to the reliability and validity of the survey results. The resultant false high ranking of the US, a strong proponent of Anglo/US capitalism, pseudo-legitimizes the propensity of US-dominated institutions and entities to persuade, coerce and, in the worst-case force other countries and their constituents to adopt Anglo/US practices and behaviours.

In our article, we first sketch how Aquinas's theory can be also of relevance to a non-confessional audience through its appeal to the 'natural light of reason.' Then we explain how his theory of 'natural law' aligns his ideas of virtue and justice. From this vantage point, we address the tension between cultural diversity and moral uniformity in the economic sphere in general and in today's globalized business world in particular.

Second, I suggest that this coexistence of couplings enables MSIs to generate policy outcomes which address the conditions of a transnational regulatory context. I argue that MSIs' way of organizing enables them to cope with three challenges: the stability, flexibility, and legitimacy of governance.

If so, corporations increase their investment in environmental responsibility when an increase improves financial performance and reduce their investment in environmental responsibility when a decrease improves financial performance. Our evidence is consistent with this last claim. We find that the behavior of corporations is consistent with the claim that they act in the interest of shareholders, increasing or decreasing their investment in environmental responsibility as necessary to improve their financial performance. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Causality; Corporate environmental responsibility; Corporate financial performance; Corporate social responsibility",,"Kim, Y.; Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0388, United States; email: y1kim@scu.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Approach - Background, context, and theory introduce the concept of a continuum between CSI and CSR, which is illustrated in a progression of graphic figures. Findings - Focus on the affirmation of CSR has distracted attention and resources from a more addressable concern: identification and denunciation of antisocial business behavior. Focusing instead on the opposite, defined here as CSI, avoids much of the ambiguity of CSR and presents a clarifying continuum between the two. Originality - Using engaging logic, uncommon connections are made between such erstwhile polar-opposites as Friedman and Carroll to reveal broad agreement that CSI is destructive and can be universally opposed. Implications - While promotion of CSR remains contentious, a broader range of business and thought leaders can find common ground by focusing on the CSI side of the continuum and uniting against it. Practitioners, academicians, and activists alike can agree that social benefits are greater from focusing on reduction of CSI rather than on promotion of CSR.

Design/methodology/approach: An online study with a convenience sample consisting of college students is used to examine the effects of a visually primed pharmaceutical advertising disclosure on attitude toward responsible advertising practice, trust toward the advertisement and attitude toward the advertisement. Findings: The results reveal that consumers form better attitudes toward responsible advertising practice and higher levels of trust toward the advertisement when the disclosure is visually primed in the advertisement. However, visual priming of the disclosure may not enhance consumers' attitudes toward the advertisement. Further evidence indicates that allergy status, a motivation factor, has the main effect on attitude toward the advertisement. When consumers have allergies, they tend to form better attitudes toward the advertisement. Research limitations/implications: Despite the inherent limitations of this study that have to be confirmed in future research, this study suggests that visual priming of advertising disclosure may enhance consumers' attitudes toward advertising practice and trust toward the advertisement. However, consumers' attitudes toward the advertisement are enhanced directly by personal relevance to the advertisement instead of visual priming. Practical implications: Based on the results of this study, the study provides a more realistic and socially responsible advertising disclosure practice for attracting consumer attention and processing toward pharmaceutical advertising.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a survey designed to uncover the underlying attitudes and values guiding young consumers' perception and evaluation of companies' engagement in and communication about CSR. The respondents are Danish students enrolled in eight different types of further or higher education. Findings: The survey shows that consumers are interested in and expect more explicit CSR communication than currently assumed by corporations and academics alike. They favour communication that is personally relevant and factually based, and consumer scepticism is not as high as suggested by current literature. The findings reflect that the value system guiding CSR evaluation and perception is not based on moral aspects and social, society-centred values. On the contrary, consumers' focus tends to be on competence and personal, self-centred values, which has implications for the challenge of communicating CSR. Practical implications: The findings provide new insights that can inform corporations in their planning and execution of CSR communication aimed at young consumers. Originality/value: This paper provides empirical evidence that corporations communicating CSR should have a much more externally oriented and explicit approach focusing on competence and self-centred values instead of on morality and society-centred values.

Over the past two decades in particular, there has been an increased recognition of this relationship by executive managers and a concomitant increase in the quantity and detail of CSR activities being voluntarily reported by companies has been observed. The increasing level of voluntary CSR reporting has been attributed to two main corporate strategies: to conform to social expectations and to legitimise business operations to salient stakeholder groups within the community. Whilst there has been extensive academic interest in the concept of CSR, it has focused almost exclusively on normative definitions of the concept, and/or the presentation of empirical evidence that details ‘why companies report their CSR activities’ and ‘what CSR activities they report’. What is lacking in the literature, however, is a focus on the ‘patterns of strategic CSR reporting’ by companies.Based on the recognition of voluntary reporting patterns in the Australian industry, we present a core/periphery model of strategic CSR disclosure.

Design/methodology/approach: To uncover the secularized German theological roots in Drucker's work, the paper juxtaposes his writings from his 60-year-long career with prior cultural interpretations of German scholarship. Findings: The analysis shows that German secularized theological concerns surrounding the fall of modernity influenced Drucker's oeuvre, leading him to advocate ""the meaningful organization"" as a pragmatic solution to the ills of modern society. While Drucker's ideas evolved over the years, the paper shows that his agenda to promote meaningful organizations in an otherwise totalitarian-prone, alienated, rationalized and meaningless era remained consistent. This interpretation suggests that Drucker believed that management had moral duties in a Nietzschean godless world. The paper shows that these themes continued structuring Drucker's corpus in three domains: the information revolution, corporate social responsibility, and the role of organizations in the third sector. Research limitations/implications: The paper reveals that Drucker was driven by deep cultural codes that proscribed many of his observations and suggested remedies. Hence, it calls for similar unearthing of the historical roots of management theory and practice. Originality/value: In this paper a novel interpretation of Drucker's work is introduced. Extending work highlighting Drucker's spiritual roots, the paper demonstrates that the German secularized theological conception of the downfall of modernity was a constant lens through which Drucker saw the world, and that this historical backdrop was the motivating spur in his attempt to save it from another catastrophe.

Methodology - The objective of this chapter is accomplished through the review of literature on the activities of multinational oil corporations in the Niger Delta, supported by qualitative interviews and analysis of archival materials. Findings - Three important findings emerged from this study. First, the participants were fully aware of the irresponsible behaviours of oil corporations in the Niger Delta, and some oil corporations were involved in these illicit acts. Second, the analysis of archival materials supports the participants' views with reference to the identities of the corporations involved in these criminal acts. Third, the absence of a strong corporate governance system in Nigeria makes it possible for the officials of oil corporations to tactically circumvent the law by involving in a maze of sophisticated corrupt acts. Research/practical implications - The implication for the academics and practitioners is evident when a corporation implements corporate social responsibility dutifully; it generates positive impact on its corporate reputation rating. Conversely, when a corporation engages in irresponsible corporate misbehaviours, it attracts negative consequences on its reputation. Originality - The originality of this chapter lies in the fact that it is the first empirical study to examine the impact of corporate social irresponsibility on the image/reputation of multinational oil corporations in Nigeria.

Canada is used as a case study in the paper. The indicators were identified based on a content analysis of 94 Canadian reports from 2008. The findings show that a total of 585 different indicators were used in the reports. Differences in the use of indicators between sectors were described. The use of indicators suggested by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was also investigated. It was found that 31 of the 94 reports included indicators explicitly identified as GRI indicators. The most reported GRI indicators appeared in 28 of the reports, while the least reported indicators appeared in 5 of the reports. This paper provides one of the first in-depth reviews of the indicators used in corporate sustainability reports.

With the emergence of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) replacing the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), there is a need for policy and practice going forward to be clearly informed by a critique of TTO (Technology Transfer Office)RDA stakeholder relationship in a lessons learned approach so that LEPs can benefit from a faster learning curve. Thus, the aim of this paper is to examine the stakeholder relationship between three regional universities in the context of its TTO and the RDA with a view to determining lessons learned for the emerging LEP approach. Although the issues raised are contextual, the abstracted stakeholder conceptualisation of the TTORDA relationship should enable wider generalisation of the issues raised beyond the UK. Stakeholder theory relationship and stage development models are used to guide a repeat interview study of the TTO and RDA stakeholder groupings. The findings, interpreted using combined category and stage based stakeholder models, show how the longitudinal development of the TTORDA stakeholder relationship for each case has progressed through different stakeholder pathways, and stages where specific targeting of funding was dependant on the stakeholder stage. Greater targeted policy and funding, based on the stakeholder relationship approach, led to the development of joint mechanisms and a closer alignment of performance measures between the TTO and the RDA. However, over-reliance on the unitary nature of the TTORDA relationship may lead to a lack of cultivation and dependency for funding from other stakeholders. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The selected variables considered were industry membership; stakeholder engagement; external (formal) assurance; the presence of an environmental management system (EMS); and specific environmental activities in the areas of packaging, waste management, recycling, climate change risk, climate change activities, and carbon footprint. The results reveal that the influencing factors for receipt of an environmental award are the presence of an environmental management system (EMS); stakeholder engagement; and disclosure on specific environmental activities (waste management, climate change risk, and climate change activities). The results also show that the level of environmental disclosure and the consequent possibility of receiving an award, are influenced by industry membership; the extent of environmental information disclosure are not the same in all industries.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is used to provide a clearer insight into the phenomenon of stakeholder management in the context of destination marketing. This research uses a combination of three sources of evidence - interviews, documents and physical artefacts (in the sense of the actual web site) - and is based on the in-depth study of the case of the development of the official web site of Tourism New Zealand (www.purenz.com). Findings: This study shows that a wide variety of organizations and even the entire population of the country who are affected by destination marketing decisions should be recognized as destination stakeholders. Tourism New Zealand's leaders' understanding of cooperation and its value emerged as a major factor having an effect on the cooperation in the purenz development. The different objectives and perspectives of key stakeholders come through clearly in the case study which suggests that different approaches for managing the diverse stakeholders in the context of destination marketing are required. Practical implications: A key finding that cooperation is not uniform has several implications for national tourism organizations (NTOs) around the globe. Study shows that the expectations of a cooperative process in destination marketing differ from group to group. This provides a useful guidance for Indian NTOs and NTOs in other countries who are responsible for tourism-related policies in their country. The study makes the clear suggestion to Indian and global tourism practitioners and policy makers that management of various stakeholders in the context of destination marketing is not a given but a strategic choice which is affected by the existing network structure and climate. Originality/value: This research is based on the data from one of the world's popular tourism destinations - New Zealand - and therefore, provides very valuable and practical guidance for national tourism organizations around the globe. Besides being of immense value to global as well as Indian practitioners, this study opens an avenue for students and academics to determine if there are differences in the understanding and expectations of cooperation among stakeholders of other tourism networks and to investigate the implications of different expectations of cooperation on the balance of power issues in inter-organizational cooperation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Destination marketing; India; National tourism organizations; New Zealand; Stakeholder management; Stakeholders; Tourism",,"Bhat, S.; AUT School of Business, Auckland University of Technology (AUT), Auckland, New Zealand; email: sbhat@aut.ac.nz",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17554217,,,,"English","Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898459863

This research aims to explore sustainable SCM issues in companies that have been recognized as leaders in their sectors, and investigate what factors influence sustainable SCM, and how practice might change in the future.

The purpose of this study is to assess whether Australian companies have adjusted their footprint-related disclosure responses. Adopting a legitimacy perspective, a key aim is to assess whether pragmatic or moral legitimation approaches dominate by determining whether disclosure tends to be more reflective of symbolism or of apparent behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of the sustainability and annual reports of the ASX's Top 50 companies is undertaken to compare carbon footprint-related disclosures in 2008 and 2005. Their extent and nature (action or symbolism) and the use of attention-attracting devices are reported for the more carbon intensive and less carbon intensive sectors. Findings: Footprint-related disclosure rates are increasing, and disclosure is being signalled more prominently. However, while carbon-intensive sectors appear to be pursuing a moral legitimation strategy underpinned by substantive action, the less intensive sectors are relying more heavily on symbolic disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small and comprises only large listed Australian companies. Practical implications: While the carbon-intensive sectors appear to be taking encouraging actions, a regulatory response may be required for the less carbon-intensive sectors to take advantage of their market power to facilitate cooperative carbon reduction with broader constituent groups. Further, incentives for the carbon-intensive sectors may be needed to encourage ongoing efforts to bridge the carbon chasm that is emerging.

Methodology - Ethics theory is used to analyse the prevalent business practice of downsizing, drawing upon literature that examines downsizing and/or explains and demonstrates the application of ethical principles. Findings - Downsizing, as defined in this chapter, is an unethical and irresponsible business practice because it reduces utility, ignores rights, creates injustice, breaks social contracts, creates agency relationships where none exist and fails to respond to the legitimate claims that employees, as a stakeholder, make upon corporations. Practical implications - Change becomes necessary to the business practice of downsizing when it is carried out by profitable companies without proper appeal to ethics principles for justification. Ethical principles may, instead, suggest alternative courses of action or techniques. Social implications - Downsizing (and other forms of mass layoffs) is not a morally neutral activity, as it engenders significant social implications (i.e. harm) that necessitate ethical consideration. Moreover, when business actions have social consequences, the interests of other stakeholders may become legitimate. Value of the chapter - This chapter illustrates the formulation and application of principles that help guide business people to take morally right courses of action. It also serves as a template for analysing other aspects of the employment relationship for a more critical approach to corporate responsibility. As shown in this chapter, ethics can have more than a peripheral role in business decision making.

This is suggested by an increasing need for accomplishing an integrative view on business activities and social aims - the so-called corporate social responsibility - especially in the current environmentally turbulent time and a rising socially conscious consumer population. But doing business is often associated with brand- or corporate misconduct as well. Hence, corporate social responsibility forms the positive component of corporate social performance (CSP), consequently a favorable brand- or company behavior. Corresponding, corporate social irresponsibility or misconduct forms the negative part of such performance.

Research to date has demonstrated that corporate social responsibility is associated with attracting job-seekers and enhancing the engagement of employees. However, much of this research focuses on the impact of corporate social responsibility on employee outcomes independent of the impact of traditional human resource practices (e.g. training, rewards). Using a variation of an existing employee opinion survey, and applying Carroll's (1979) model of corporate social responsibility, this paper assesses the relationship between employee engagement, traditional human resource practices, and corporate social responsibility. Data collected from 3147 employees showed a significant positive correlation between corporate social responsibility and employee engagement. However, corporate social responsibility explained little additional variance in engagement beyond that explained by traditional human resource practices. This paper concludes that allocating attention and resources to corporate social responsibility may not be as advantageous as investing in the improvement of core human resource practices, when the goal is to improve employee engagement. Future research needs to examine why corporate social responsibility explains little additional variance in employee engagement, specifically examining the manner in which employees perceive corporate social responsibility and the extent to which corporate social responsibility encompasses traditional human resource practices. © The Author(s) 2011.","business ethics; corporate performance; corporate social responsibility; employee engagement; human resources",,"Smith, V.; Department of Psychology, Macquarie University, PO Box 204, Lennox Head, NSW, 2478, Australia; email: tori_smith50@hotmail.com",,,03128962,,,,"English","Aust.

To cope with new levels of competition development strategies should be identified to enable an increase in competitiveness, both in the local context and in the global context, but in terms of sustainability. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the broad debate on sustainable competitive development in a regional key, highlighting the importance of the close link between the competitive position of a given territorial context and the protection of the integrity of natural resources, including cultural factors and the landscape. However, this requires the adoption of behavioral patterns of business and individuals working in a long-term perspective and based on the principles of social responsibility. The strong interdependence between the firm and the external environment implys that the corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a fundamental element for safeguarding environmental heritage and culture resources and therefore, more generally, the environmental sustainability of regional systems. In this scenario, the water buffalo supply chain in Campania region (South of Italy) presents an explicative case to understand the huge potential opportunities inherent to environmental protection and sustainable development paths and how CSR can really become a source of competitive advantage and a differentiation tool.","Corporate social responsability; Environmental sustainability; Territorial competitiveness; Water buffalo meat",,"Scarpato, D.; University of Naples Parthenope, Fondazione Simone CesarettiItaly",,,15822559,,,,"English","Qual.

The findings suggested that these variables could affect learning through HRD in CSR activities.","Corporate social responsibility; Human resource development; Influential factors; Learning",,"Sukserm, T.; Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation, Hiroshima University, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8529, Japan; email: thumwimon-suk@hiroshima-u.ac.jp",,,15116670,,,,"English","Int.

Findings: This study provides evidence of Islamic influence on the CSRD of IFIs. It finds that the largest part of CSRD produced by the IFIs is the disclosure of reports of the Shari'a Supervisory Board. IFIs also disclose other Islamic information (e.g. ""Zakah"" and charity donation, and free interest loan) and report on their compliance with Islam along with information of philanthropy, employees and community.

The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) applied different strategies to maintain control of its Iranian assets in the face nationalist demands - political and covert mechanisms, market based, resource access controls, and CSR programs. This paper investigates the third, and least explored, strand of their strategy. It identifies managerial strategies for CSR engagement with respect to three corresponding interest groups: politicians and diplomats, shareholders, and local employees, drawing on a variety of previously unused archival sources. From prior studies it is unclear whether the AIOC's CSR programs, for example, in employment and housing, were motivated by social improvement, its business agenda, or responses to legislative pressures from the Iranian government. A detailed examination of CSR policy and private correspondence between AIOC's senior executives about their negotiations with the Iranian government shows that they engaged in and reported voluntary CSR activities to strengthen their reputation and negotiating position but refused to compromise on aspects of CSR that threatened the existing managerial hierarchy of control. This interpretation is supported by a content analysis of the company's annual reports in the years before and after nationalization, revealing a choice of topics and language intended to support its self-presentation as a socially concerned employer.

The increased market competition and stakeholder pressure determines companies to start engaging in CSR activities.

Nevertheless, there remains a protracted debate about the legitimacy and value of corporate responses to CSR concerns. This study explored whether CSR is linked to profitability. This study bases its measurement of CSR on content analysis of the annual reports of Royal Dutch Shell Plc. This research used a case study approach and analysed data from several key performance indicators reported in Royal Dutch Shell Plc's sustainability report and annual account over a 5-year period; 2001-2005. Results indicate that socially responsible corporate performance can be associated with profitability. Although this study did not explore the direction of the causal connections, nevertheless, the findings indicate that CSR is positively related to better financial performance (profitability) and this relationship is statistically significant. The Royal Dutch Shell Plc is chosen as it is a global energy and petrochemical company, operating in more than 145 countries and employing approximately 119,000 people (Shell, 2005). Royal Dutch Shell is one of the biggest in the oil sector and also listed as the third top company in the world. As Shell is a well-known international corporation, the perceptions of its CSR are an important indicator for not only the public at large, but also senior management of the corporation. Literature review has revealed that this kind of CSR studies involving Shell Plc is unique.

It is based on the claim that firms have a corporate social responsibility to achieve some larger social goals, and can do so without a financial sacrifice. While this appealing proposition has convinced many people, it is fundamentally misleading. If markets are working well, there is no need to appeal to companies to fulfill some vague social responsibility. If there is a market failure, then there is a tradeoff between private profits and public interest; in that case, it is neither desirable nor effective to rely on the goodwill of managers to maximize social welfare. When markets fail, some constraints need to be imposed on them. There are four sources of constraints: corporate social responsibility, industry self-regulation, civil society activism, and government regulation.

Given the relatively recent existence and rapid growth of conduct codes, this paper addresses how their content has changed over time.

On the one hand, consumers demand more and more CSR information from corporations. On the other hand, research indicates a considerable gap between consumers' apparent interest in CSR and the limited role of CSR in purchase behavior. This article attempts to shed light on this paradox by drawing on qualitative data from in-depth interviews. The findings show that the evaluation of CSR initiatives is a complex and hierarchically structured process, during which consumers distinguish between core, central, and peripheral factors. This article describes these factors in detail and explains the complexity of consumers' assessment of CSR. These insights then serve as a basis for discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings. To this end, the article contributes to a better understanding of the role of CSR in consumption decisions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Consumer behavior; Corporate social responsibility; Purchase intention; Qualitative research",,"Öberseder, M.; WU Vienna, Institute for International Marketing Management, Augasse 2-6, 1090 Vienna, Austria; email: magdalena.oeberseder@wu.ac.at",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Responsibilities are classified into five categories as follows: First, Corporate Financial Reporting (CFR) that integrates General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), Financial Services Authority (FSA), and International Accounting Standards (IAS). Second, Risk Management Procedures (RMP), that incorporates methods and directives which arise from Basel I, Basel II, Capital Adequacy frameworks or solvency ratio benchmarks. Third, Corporate Governance (CG), that integrates Sarbanes - Oxley Act, Audit Committees, and Internal Audit Mechanisms. Fourth, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), that consists of instructions and standards such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) - social and environmental, Social accountability (SA 8000) - working conditions, International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9000). Fifth, Stockholders Value Creation (SVC), that is a set of methodologies and ratios used in order to measure value creation for shareholders such as Strategic and Balanced scorecard, Economic Value Added EVA ®, and other business performance management tools. On the other, the Rating Agencies (RA) applies various rating systems in different fields. Based on this framework, the article correlates all qualitative and quantitative components, with the banks' ratings. The dependent variable is the bank's financial health score, represented by a dummy variable based on the bank's rating by the rating agencies and from the relevant value of each bank that arises from its performance in the above mentioned framework of responsibilities. The independent quantitative variables belong to a set of financial, risk and market key ratios and the qualitative variables to a set of dummy variables which describe the above framework.

Can the tobacco industry be trusted to educate our children about the dangers of smoking? Is a brewer the best source of health promotion? The paper argues for transparency and critical appraisal. Design/methodology/approach: The paper looks at the issues of tobacco and alcohol in more detail, emphasises the need for caution and suggests guidelines for future practice. Findings: The fiduciary duty of the corporation means that all its efforts - including any social marketing campaigns or corporate social responsibility - must be focused first and foremost on the success of the business and the enhancement of shareholder value; any wider public health benefits will inevitably be subjugated to this core purpose. And there is good evidence to show that the principal beneficiaries of apparently public-spirited campaigns run by tobacco and alcohol companies are the sponsors. In the hands of a corporation, then, social marketing will always transmute into commercial marketing. Practical implications: We should then proceed with our eyes wide open, alert to the danger of counterproductive outcomes, armed with independent evaluation and in the full knowledge that wherever industry-funded efforts to educate the public replace those run by objective third parties, harm will be done. Originality/value: The paper, concerned with industry-sponsored social marketing, broadens the discussion beyond communications.

The project was based on a partnership with the largest college in the city specialising in post-16 education and training for residents and employees. The college targeted people as potential candidates for the programme through their prior attendance on or interest in care courses at the college, rather than the council employing more traditional methods of recruitment. Surveys, focus groups and interviews were utilised to capture the views and experiences of the participants, project workers and line managers, and also evidence of the project's impact on service delivery in the care department. The article adds to our conceptual and practical knowledge of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the public sector in three distinct ways. From a social and business perspective, the findings of the research highlight a potentially more robust strategy for matching long-term unemployed citizens to training and job opportunities in the public sector than is otherwise possible through the more conventional route of the job centre. Secondly, through this approach and with appropriate pre-training, a greater understanding of and empathy for the service users can be developed in the new organisational members, strengthening the subsequent ethical delivery and quality of the service. Finally, a re-conceptualisation of Carroll's influential model of CSR, which also specifically incorporates the ethical and social inclusion duties of public sector organisations not only as service providers but also as potential employers, offers a more tailored paradigm for understanding this unique yet under-researched element of CSR theory and practice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Disadvantaged communities; Equality; Public sector; Recruitment strategies; Social care; Social inclusion; Training and development",,"Bennett, A.

NGOs and multinational enterprises as well as their interaction in public-private-partnerships have become popular research objects. However, these partnerships are often assessed in terms of effectiveness which leads to juxtapositioning binding and effective versus non-binding and ineffective initiatives. Considering such an either/or-logic to be of limited insight, the article argues that current research on public-private-partnerships suffers from four conceptual difficulties: (1) an underspecified concept of effectiveness, (2) a missing discussion on the yardsticks chosen for assessments, (3) a tendency to (over-)generalize individual findings and (4) underlying yet seldom reflected actor assumptions. To help engage with these difficulties, the paper conceptualizes partnerships as social contexts. Within such contexts, dynamics influence corporate identity and action and create new awareness as well as new conduct. Such a perspective allows to go beyond weighing the effectiveness of binding versus the likelihood of non-binding initiatives. The argument is illustrated by analyzing the emergence, development, and impact of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights with respect to BP and Chevron. © 2011 De Gruyter.

Based on the established premise of customer-corporate (C-C) identification, in which consumers respond favorably to companies with corporate social responsibility initiatives that they identify with, we propose that consumers would respond similarly to companies with sustainability initiatives. We postulate that consumers care about protecting and preserving favorable economic environments (an economic dimension of sustainability) as much as they care about natural environments. Thus, we investigate how two sustainability dimensions (i. e., environmental and economic) and price can influence consumer responses. Using an experimental method, we demonstrate that consumers favor sustainability in both dimensions by giving positive evaluations of the company and purchase intent. In addition, consumers respond more negatively to poor company sustainability than to high company sustainability. In comparison, consumers respond more negatively to the company's poor commitment to caring for the environment than to the company's poor commitment to economic sustainability. We also find that consumers do not respond favorably to low prices when they have information about the firm's poor environmental sustainability. Finally, we find support for an interaction effect between consumer support for sustainability and corporate sustainability; that is, consumers evaluate a company more favorably if the company shares the consumers' social causes. Overall, we conclude, from our empirical study, support for the idea that consumers do respond to multiple dimensions of sustainability. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Consumer responses; Economical; Environment; Experiment; Sustainability",,"Choi, S.; School of Business, University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; email: schoi@unbc.ca",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Following literature on the links between corporate social performance and financial performance, we attempt to validate if the relationship between environmental innovations and financial performance is not just unidirectional but likewise bi-directional. This comparative case study of Japanese automotive and electronics companies aims to: (1) determine if environmental innovations positively impact financial performance in prior years; (2) alternatively explore if financial performance in prior years positively impact environmental innovations; (3) establish if virtuous cycles exist in the relationships of variables; and (4) probe further if the directions, impacts or relationships hold consistently over a longitudinal period. Panel data regression analysis was performed for ten automotive and ten electronic companies listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, to determine the impact of the variables on each other for both directions from 2001 to 2009. Granger causality tests were performed to establish virtuous cycles. Finally, the same statistical techniques were employed on disaggregated data sets for the periods, 2001 to 2006 and 2004 to 2009, to capture any longitudinal differences. Our findings which point to the stark contrasts between the automotive and electronics companies, allow us to support earlier theorization and propose rival theories for results contrary to expectations. The automotive companies exemplify the resource-based view perspective as positive impacts of environmental innovations that are observed on revenues, profits, assets, long-term debt and equity, and vice-versa. However, these impacts seem to weaken over time. The electronics companies show only revenues and long-term debt as significantly controlled by environmental innovations and vice-versa. There are, likewise, longitudinal differences as a result of the recent global economic crisis in the industry.

For teaching, we provide insights on how to communicate in a conflict situation. © 2011 Association for Business Communication.","business ethics; communicating conflict; conventionalist analysis; stakeholder communication",,"Lehtimäki, H.; School of Management, University of Tampere, FIN-33014, Finland; email: hanna.lehtimaki@uta.fi",,,10805699,,,,"English","Bus.

Not only does the meaning of CR constantly shift, but so do public expectations and the baseline of acceptable corporate practice. New CR behaviors become common practice through two mechanisms. New norms of industry-wide practices evolve in response to shifting stakeholder expectations and demands, in response to changing laws and regulations. Moreover, changes in laws are often facilitated by evolving voluntary CR norms. As either norms of behavior or laws shift over time, the ""business case"" for certain CR behaviors strengthens, but at the same time the very definition of CR shifts as firms find themselves pressured to adopt additional CR behaviors, whose business benefts may initially be unclear. This time dynamic thus changes what is profitable for companies and reveals that what is and is not responsible corporate practice is both time-and context-dependent rather than universal.",,,"Rivoli, P.",,,00081256,,,,"English","Calif.

The research built an in-depth understanding of how to deliver an improvement in the sustainable development of local rural Indian villages. The sustainable development projects are developed and implemented by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) but are part funded through the corporate responsibility programme of a multi national Bank. The research focused on the processes used in the projects, how they were implemented and the outcomes achieved. The research is unusual in management research, in that it takes a stakeholder perspective rather than the more customary corporate perspective. Consequently the focus is on understanding the processes, implementation and outcomes from the perspective of three groups of stakeholders. The three groups are the Bank, the NGOs and the villagers who are the end recipients of the projects. This paper does not explore the outcomes of this research but rather describes the research methodology undertaken to effectively execute the research. The research methodology chosen was that of case study with an interpretivist stance. Whilst case study can be an umbrella term for multiple data collection tools, there was a focus on collecting data via discussion and observation, in line with the interpretivist paradigm. To achieve the required level of discussion and observation was facilitated by undertaking an ethnographically-styled approach. This ethnographic-styled approach included the researcher spending time living in the Indian villages with respondents to understand the outcomes of the sustainable development projects which had been undertaken from their perspective. The data gathering processes include structured, semi-structured and in-depth interviews across the three primary stakeholder groups of respondents. Other data gathering included observation, documentation, artefacts, video and photographs. In summary this paper provides an insight into a method for undertaking research in a local rural developing country context. It particularly focuses on taking a stakeholder perspective to corporate interventions in a community, rather than the more usual company focused approach. It further contributes to the development of appropriate methodology for contexts where the researcher is from a different cultural and linguistic background to the respondents. © Academic Publishing International Ltd.","Ethnographic-styled approach; Interpretivist case study; Language barriers in research; Research in a developing country; Video research",,"Swan, N.; Henley Business School, University of Reading, Henley, United Kingdom; email: Nicola.Swan@henley.reading.ac.uk",,,14777029,,,,"English","Electron.

Pragmatism is especially relevant to those organizational scholars who are concerned with understanding the dynamic processes and practices of organizational life. This chapter lays out the historical development of Pragmatism, recognizing the originating contributions of Peirce, James, Dewey and Mead. Although each of these writers developed unique philosophical positions, their ideas are all permeated by four key themes: experience, inquiry, habit and transaction. The interplay between these themes informs a temporal view of social practice in which selves and situations are continuously constructed and reconstructed through experimental and reflexive processes of social engagement. We then use organizational learning theory as an example to illustrate the relevance of these four themes, contrasting the anti-dualistic stance of Pragmatism with the work of Argyris and Schön. Finally we turn to consider Weick's organizing and sensemaking, suggesting that Pragmatism offers three potential foci for further development of these theories, namely continuity of past and future in the present, the transactional nature of social agency and reflexivity in social practices. Similarly we see potential for Pragmatism to productively inform the theorizing of other organizational practices such as identity work, strategy work, emotion work and idea work.",,,"Elkjaer, B.",,,0733558X,,,,"English","Res.

In response to this attrition, this article presents three arguments. First, we suggest that trust is the ""glue"" of any viable political economy, and we propose that the stakes of violating public trust are particularly high in light of the asymmetry between trust and distrust. Second, we identify a constellation of key barriers to overcoming distrust that companies face in the current environment: (1) corporate mind-sets that promote a preoccupation with quantification, hierarchical leadership models, and ""blind trust"" in authority; (2) the anonymity of core stakeholders; (3) the agency of the media as a driver of the political economy; and (4) firm-centric models of stakeholder relationships. Third, we argue that, notwithstanding these challenges, these phenomena are not fatal and can be addressed through a holistic transformation in corporate culture. Such a transformation might include a shift to collaborative leadership models and replacing authority models with responsibility, a ""names and faces"" approach to stakeholders through cases and stories, more egalitarian communication exchanges with external stakeholders, and a reprioritization of the firm as a vital element among others within a system rather than the central core of a network. We conclude that the value of trust at the individual, institutional, national, and global levels cannot be overstated. Without a reinvigoration of trust in our political economies, at all levels, the future of an economically vibrant planet is indeed bleak. © 2011 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,,"Werhane, P.; Department of Philosophy, Managing Director of the Institute for Business, Professional Ethics at DePaul University, Chicago, IL, United States; email: pwerhane@depaul.edu",,,00453609,,,,"English","Bus.

It is predicated on the idea that major advances in knowledge will transpire when scholars, while pursuing their research interests, also consider addressing the core problems confronting society. For a workable engaged agenda in science and technology studies, one that informs scholarship as well as shapes practice and policy, the traditional terms of engagement must be renegotiated to be more open and mutual than has historically characterized the nature of inquiry in this field. At the same time, it is essential to protect individual privacy and preserve government confidentiality. Yet there is a scientific possibility for and benefit to introducing more collaborative and deliberative research approaches between scholar and subject in ways that will not violate these first-order ethics. To make the case, this article discusses the possibilities and perils of engaged science and technology scholarship by drawing on our own recent experiences to conduct and apply STS research while embedded in the National Science Foundation. Brief accounts of these experiences reveal the opportunities as well as the challenges of engaged scholarship.

Signatory companies voluntarily agree to abide by the GC ten principles and explicitly declare compliance with social and human rights, environmental protection, and anti-corruption practices. Participants commit to CSR and are required to publish a yearly report called Communication on Progress (COP). If firms fail to provide a COP for one year they are labeled ""non-communicating"", and for two years they are ""delisted"" from the GC. In 2006, the first list of non-communicating and delisted firms was announced. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent by which being a signatory company - that reports COP - reduces information risk, and thus leads to better market returns, lower cost of debt, and lower cost of equity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors studied the period from the launch of the GC until the first list of non-communicating firms was made public, investigating the extent by which being a signatory company - that reports COP - reduces information risk, and thus leads to better market returns, lower cost of debt, and lower cost of equity. Findings: The results suggest that communicating (reporting) firms have statistically significant higher market valuation - lower book to market - than companies that initially agree to participate in the GC but that do not comply with the reporting requirement. Communicating firms also have statistically significant higher ROA, lower cost of debt, lower cost of equity, and lower beta indicating better performance and less risk. The authors also find some evidence that non-communicating firms might be ""free riding"" and could have joined the GC to improve their corporate image. Originality/value: The paper provides evidence of the value of CSR reporting. It is not enough to disclose compliance with CSR, but it is also necessary to account for this through some sort of formal mechanism such as a CSR report. Voluntary disclosures and narrative statements in annual reports will continue to have questionable information content, but standards of environmental reporting, such as the Global Reporting Initiative, not only improve the way in which social and environmental performance is measured, but they also provide evidence of compliance. This paper also presents evidence of the value of voluntary initiatives such as the GC when these initiatives are supported by formal reporting and when accountability/enforcement measures are in place. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Citizenship; Communication on Progress (COP); Corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting; Global Compact; Performance and CSR; Voluntary disclosure; Voluntary reporting",,"Kimbro, M.B.; School of Business Administration, Gonzaga University, Spokane, WA, United States; email: kimbro@jepson.gonzaga.edu",,,18347649,,,,"English","Int.

The purpose of this paper is to focus on the processes of stakeholder legitimacy and interest detection, namely ethical considerations and community obligations, to promote CSR as an intangible strategic asset. Design/methodology/approach: The two relatively large service-based firms (contrasting not-for-profit with for-profit) that were selected for study were Pittsburgh-based, namely the largest single employer of the metropolitan area of Pittsburgh (The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)) and WESCO, a distributor of electrical construction products and electrical and industrial maintenance products and the largest domestic provider of integrated supply services. Findings: It was found that the management teams at UPMC and WESCO approach CSR-based strategies and its initiative from completely different perspectives. UPMC functions a not-for-profit organization while WESCO is a for-profit entity. They also approach CSR differently as a result from its geographically based service and product offerings, UPMC being more local/regional and WESCO going for global markets. These differences promote differences in the groups and types of CSR that each company is currently engaged in promoting.

Engagement in CSR activities has proven to have certain benefits for companies, ranging from better financial performance to shareholder wealth maximisation. Companies' value creation process has been dominated by companies' hidden assets and concurrently the concept of value added intellectual capital (VAIC). The purpose of this study is to provide evidence from an emerging market about the interaction between CSR and VAIC, and thus contribute to the understanding and awareness of the significance of socially responsible investments for companies. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analyses, which take into account VAIC and its dimensions, are conducted on a sample of manufacturing companies listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) during the period 2007-2008. It is shown that some causality is related to the existence of a lag during the periods for the variables CSR and VAIC. Based on previous empirical studies, this study conducts the analyses based on the assumption that there may be a relationship between firm age, financial leverage, return on sales and market-to-book ratio and CSR. Findings - The results fail to provide any significant relationship between CSR and VAIC during the period analysed. These findings should not overshadow the benefits of CSR, but should be attributed to the time it takes for these investments to have an impact on firms' intellectual capital. Practical implications - A larger sample of firms covering a longer time span could be utilised. Generation of a CSR index in Turkey that eliminates the subjectivity of CSR measurement will undoubtedly improve the accuracy of the analyses. Originality/value - This paper increases the understanding of the relationship between corporate social responsibility and value-added intellectual capital.

Findings - In the 1950s the primary focus was on businesses' responsibilities to society and doing good deeds for society. In the 1960s key events, people and ideas were instrumental in characterizing the social changes ushered in during this decade. In the 1970s business managers applied the traditional management functions when dealing with CSR issues, while, in the 1980s, business and social interest came closer and firms became more responsive to their stakeholders. During the 1990s the idea of CSR became almost universally approved, also CSR was coupled with strategy literature and finally, in the 2000s, CSR became definitively an important strategic issue. Research limitations/implications - The focus of this work is on researches that have generated much of the original discourse on this issue, since it is difficult to cover all of the existing literature. In addition, this analysis of the conceptual evolution of CSR started with Bowen's, although earlier references can be found. Originality/value - This paper provides didactical information of the conceptual evolution of CSR, also it advances on the discussion of the progress of CSR throughout time that has caught the attention of several researchers and finally it provides recommendations for further studies.

The water utilities are newly privatised, hybrid organisations that are both professionally and politically driven. The purpose of this paper is an examination of the opportunities and barriers in CSR in these publicly owned enterprises (POEs). The research question is: why do the opportunities of CSR in POEs seem more beneficial than for normal private businesses, while the barriers seem to slow the progression? The opportunities lie in the closeness to and willingness of the political decision-makers of the city. The barriers to CSR in POEs stem from the legal regulatory framework, which dictates efficiencies, price and cost reductions and limits the ethical investments of the POEs. Design/methodology/ approach - The methodology of the paper is a comparative study and analysis of the current legislative and organisational framework for the POEs compared to the contemporary CSR approaches of Matten and Moon, Wartick and Wood, and Mitchell ITet al./IT Findings - The findings show that a schism seems to exist in CSR of hybrid organisations, which is hard to overcome. Originality/value - The originality of the paper and its contribution to the CSR literature lies in its pointing out the issues in opportunities and barriers in CSR in public, hybrid organisations that need to be solved before CSR can be fully implemented in public service companies at the same level as in private businesses.

Design/methodology/approach - Analysis and generalisation of various literature sources were applied to organise critical CSR promoting and hindering factors. In order to evaluate the CSR development problems in Lithuania, legal documents and collateral analysis of empirical CSR research in new EU member states and Lithuania methods were applied. Findings - The antithesis between economic and social firms' objectives has existed for a long time, but the current modern world's construct refuted this concept in economic terms and has highlighted social, ethical and environmental values, taking into account definite quality options for everyone - the public sector, NGOs and society - with great expectations to act in a socially responsible way. The priorities of CSR, as emphasised by the European Union (EU), are relevant not only to old EU member states, but also to new ones. The research results show that despite the Lithuanian CSR development vision and goals, the main problems relate to the lack of understanding of CSR and a systematic CSR implementation approach. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on previously implemented empirical investigations in new EU member states with particular attention to CSR promoting and hindering factors and deeper insight into Lithuanian CSR development issues, which provide a starting point for further CSR research in the area of transitional economies. Practical implications - The paper summarises empirical investigations implemented in new EU member states during the last few years and brings a broader understanding of CSR development problems in transitional economies.

Also to determine the drivers and barriers of CSR implementation in the context of Iran. Design/methodology/ approach - Based on the seven core subjects of ISO 26000 standard, namely organizational governance, human rights, labor practices, the environment, fair operating practices, consumer issues, community involvement and development and also an in-depth study of literature review the related elements of these core subjects were identified. The study collected data through a structured questionnaire. The 105 responses received were analyzed descriptively and the result presented. Findings - Results showed that the main reason for CSR implementation for these organizations is the increase of corporate identity and general reputation and the main barrier is general lack of knowledge or awareness of CSR. Also most of their efforts and activities are limited to philanthropic or sponsorship actions. Hence it could be concluded that CSR is a concept that is yet to be fully understood and appreciated among these organizations. Research limitations/implications - This study has been limited to Iran. Hence the findings and conclusions drawn from this research are representative of the Iranian context only. It is recommended in future to include other countries in this research. Furthermore, only one response represents the view of an organization. So the need to exercise caution in generalizing the results. Originality/value - This study has the potential to enhance the understanding of CSR practices and initiatives, and drivers and barriers amongst researches and practitioners in the context of Iran.

The importance of these scholarly inquiries has been underscored by the recent condemnation of high executive remuneration levels in the face of corporate failures and financial declines. Most researchers confine their analyses to single equation models that test various determinants and different measures of compensation. In this paper, we expand this approach to a multi-equation model that examines the determinants of executive compensation within a broader framework. Our specification explicitly allows for the endogeneity of executive compensation, firm financial performance, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Chief among our findings is that this endogeneity assumption is supported, which means that financial performance and social performance are determined simultaneously. We further show that CSR is among the determinants of CEO pay, which indicates that pay-for-performance does not sufficiently explain compensation. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.","Agency theory; Corporate financial performance (CFP); Corporate social performance (CSP); Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Executive compensation; Pay-for-performance; Social performance measures; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable development",,"Thomas, J.M.; Bentley University, Economics, 175 Forest St, AAC-171, Waltham, MA 02452, United States; email: jthomas@bentley.edu",,,15353958,,,,"English","Corp.

The conceptual framework offers important insights regarding the instrumental motives of managers in performing CSP initiatives. Based on a sample of 124 S&P 500 firms, the authors found that it is a firm's visibility to stakeholders, rather than its economic performance, that has the larger impact on managers' decisions regarding how much CSP their firms exhibit. The results show that more profitable firms may not be motivated to engage actively in CSP unless they are under greater scrutiny by various firm stakeholders. The authors also found that organizational slack (estimated as cost of capital) is positively associated with a Social CSP dimension but negatively associated with a Strategic CSP dimension.

Findings: Governance at all levels but particularly the international level involves corporations and their stakeholders. Together they have created non-statutory corporate social responsibility (CSR) standards which now influence significant amounts of international trade and investment, thereby presenting new benefits, risks and challenges for sustainable development. Governments around the world are now innovating public policies on these standards, which can be categorised to inform policy development: governments prepare, prefer, promote and prescribe CSR standards.

Furthermore, despite calls for increasing attention as to how leaders influence their followers' perceptions of the importance of ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) for organizational effectiveness, no empirical study to date has assessed the comparative impact of transformational and transactional leadership styles on follower CSR attitudes.

Not only are boards considering how they might engage with key stakeholders, but stakeholders are also pursuing greater participation in the strategic decisions of companies in which they invest. While this is an emerging concept in companies governed by unitary boards, as in North America, the issue of stakeholder engagement in various forms is also entering debate in other countries around the world. In general, however, the idea of shareholder or stakeholder representation on the boards of most UK and Commonwealth companies is anathema. Forces now influencing the development of strategies for stakeholder engagement and the rise of active investors include changing corporate governance rules which give investors more power in the election of directors, the increasing role of pension plans and hedge fund investment groups which have produced investors who keep a close eye on company performance and value, and a sluggish or turbulent stock market as a result of the financial crisis initiated by the credit crunch in the sub-prime mortgage markets. In this paper the phenomenon of stakeholder representation is examined and results of a recent survey conducted among a large sample of New Zealand directors are presented. The findings suggest that these traditionally oriented boards are increasingly inwardly focused and are without an agenda for building and managing shareholder and stakeholder relations. Accordingly, such boards are unlikely to regard stakeholder engagement as a serious strategic issue and are thus also likely to miss significant opportunities in the changed business environment to benefit from stakeholder support. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Board of directors; Financial crisis; New Zealand; Shareholder activism; Stakeholder relations",,"Ingley, C.; Faculty of Business and Law, Auckland University of Technology, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; email: coral.ingley@aut.ac.nz",,,13853457,,,,"English","J.

They are to embark on a journey, following the ""yellow-brick road"", a proverbial path to a promised land of one's hopes and dreams, in order to find brains, a heart and courage. The effect of new regulations introduced in Australia to curtail corporate misbehaviour is detailed by storytelling. The Wizard of OZ is the title of a story written by L. Frank Baum and published in 1899. In 1939, Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios made a movie of the story. I have used The Wizard of Oz to argue that corporate boards and senior management need to make decisions using a balance of intellect (brains), emotionality (heart), and a sense of purpose (courage). The inspiration for using Baum's story, as an analogy for the transformation needed in corporate boards and senior management, comes from Biberman and Whitty (Journal of Organisational Change Management 10(2):130-188, 1997). This research is based on interviews with Board members and non-executive directors from five companies listed in the Business Review Weekly (BRW) Top Twenty-five Companies in Australia (2007) and a range of secondary data sources. The financial and reputational success of the organisation and its members is out of balance with the human and social costs and benefits. Respondents confirmed that board members and senior management should willingly provide information about the corporation and its activities to its stakeholders, that information and data should be transparent, the true extent of director remuneration should be revealed and that financial reporting should be true and accurate. Board members and senior management can be assisted to operate in a way that observes socially responsible values and balances the obligation for profit maximisation with corporate social responsibilities (CSR). This study provides steps that organisations can take to achieve a balance of intellect, emotionality and sense of purpose and therefore realise their corporate social responsibility. The results of this empirical and secondary research suggest a method that may be used to make board members and senior managers more aware of their corporate social responsibilities and curtail corporate misbehaviour where the introduction of a range of new regulations has had little effect. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Corporate boards; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Metaphors",,"Kemp, S.; Swinburne University of Technology, Lilydale Campus, Locked Bag 218, Lilydale, VIC 3140, Australia; email: skemp@swin.edu.au",,,13853457,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample formed by companies with investments in R&D for the 2003-2007 period worldwide, a bidirectional model is defined, one model in which the innovation realized by companies is a function of CSR practices, activity sector, firm size and risk, and another model in which CSR practices are a function of innovation, activity sector, firm size and risk. Findings: The results of both models show that the bidirectional relationship between the two strategic decisions is negative. However, the effect of the sustainable practices undertaken by those companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index on innovative efforts is statistically less significant. It was also found that this type of investment takes three years to show its value added in CSR practices and that the relationship between innovation and corporate social responsibility practices is not the same in different sectors. Practical implications: The empirical evidence suggests that, in general, companies do not implement innovations linked to topics of sustainability; at the same time, an incompatibility exists between investment in R&D and the encouragement of corporate sustainable behavior.

I make use of Jacques Derrida's theorizing on contested meaning to argue that CSR's ambiguity is actually necessary in light of its functional role as a ""supplement"" to corporate profit-seeking. As a discourse that refuses to conclusively resolve the tension between profit-seeking and prosociality, CSR expresses an important critical perspective which demands that firms act responsibly, while retaining the overall corporate frame of shareholder supremacy. CSR does this by ambivalently affirming both profit-seeking and prosociality, a necessary contradiction. Attempts to reduce CSR's ambiguity can thus only succeed by undermining its viability as a normative discourse that captures how certain elements of society understand how firms should act. The analysis suggests that greater scholarly attention is needed with regard to the material discursive environments within which discourses such as CSR are deployed. A discursive approach to research could thus benefit future practitioners, who have to act according to fluid standards of responsibility that cannot be authoritatively defined, but which can be better understood than they are at present. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Différance; Discourse; Jacques Derrida; Supplementarity; Undecidability",,"Sabadoz, C.; Department of Political Science, University of Toronto, 100 St. George St., Toronto, ON M5R3G3, Canada; email: cameron.sabadoz@utoronto.ca",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

This study examined newspaper editorials, letters to the editor, op-ed columns, news analyses, and guest columns for three aspects: media attention, media prominence, and media valence. Results showed an increase in the number of opinion pieces covering CSR issues over the 25-year period. The prominence of each of the four CSR dimensions varied over time. Each of the four CSR dimensions had its moment of media prominence when it was more important than the other dimensions. The most prevalent valence of the opinion pieces was negative; the volume of negative pieces increased over the 25 years, whereas the number of opinions with positive, neutral, and mixed tones showed little change over time.

We examine how a firm's prior signals regarding ethical behaviour and values, as demonstrated through CSR initiatives, may both ameliorate and exacerbate market reactions. CSR initiatives may buffer a firm against general wrong-doing but expose it to greater scrutiny and sanction for related wrong-doing. Our results show that firms with enhanced overall reputations for CSR are partially buffered from scandal revelations. However, we find that when firms possess an enhanced reputation for CSR associated with corporate governance, violations pertaining specifically to governance are viewed as hypocritical and more harshly sanctioned. We also find lower and negative market reactions for firms that delay but self-disclose their involvement in the scandal.

The study seeks to describe how boycott motives are embedded in the fields of consumer resistance and anti-consumption. Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies a mixed-method approach of qualitative and quantitative methods. Internet postings of 790 boycott supporters are analyzed by means of a content analysis. The relevance of different motives is examined via frequency analysis. Contingency analysis is applied to explore segment-specific motives. Findings: Using the example of factory relocation, the study identifies several idiosyncratic motives that are contingent to the boycott cause. Additionally, it confirms that the motives of different adopters differ. Individuals who are personally affected or feel solidarity with those affected join the boycott relatively early whereas those who join later consider the pros and cons of the boycott more rationally. Research limitations/implications: Further research should apply quantitative research methods to ensure the stability of the findings. The external validity needs to be tested for different boycott types. Practical implications: Some consumers join boycotts because they feel solidarity with those affected by the actions of a company (resistance-boycotter), whereas others generally criticize the free-market economy and are generally prone to boycott any company (anti-consumption-boycotters). Companies need to ensure that both types of boycotters consider them socially responsible. Originality/value: This study provides evidence that boycott motives are case-contingent.

However, foreign investment also has implications for protection and enjoyment of human rights. Transnational corporations manage their risks by imposing stabilization clauses on host countries that constrain their ability to protect and enhance human rights.

For, though such businesses violate human rights they have been largely ignored by business ethicists. It is time to surmount this indifference in view of recent international efforts to define illicit businesses for regulatory purposes. Standing in the way, however, is a meta-ethical question as to whether any business can be declared unqualifiedly immoral. In support of an affirmative answer I address a number of counter-indications by comparing approaches to organized crime and to corporate crime, comparing the ethical critique of businesses studied in business ethics and those socially banned, and comparing the business ethics assumption as to businesses' ethicality to societal ethical neutrality regarding war-related businesses. My conclusion: to help advance respect for human rights, business ethicists should apply their expertise to the task of defining illicit businesses. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate crime; corporate social responsibility; human rights; illicit business; international law; organized crime; UNGC",,"Byrne, E.

A belief is that transparency can provoke learning and also positive institutional change by empowering private watchdogs to monitor and pressure business leaders to alter harmful behavior. Beginning in the late 1990s, a private movement emerged that pressured corporations to disclose the identify of their global supplier factories. These activists believed that factory disclosure would lead to greater accountability by corporations for the working conditions under which their products are made, which in time would improve labor practices. In 1995, Nike and Levi-Strauss (Levis) surprised the business community by publishing their supplier lists. This paper describes case studies of Nike and Levis, tracking the evolution from resistance to supply chain transparency through to the decision to be industry leaders in factory disclosure.

Given the workload and time pressures associated with their role, editors face an important ethical dilemma: Should they allocate sufficient time to the editorial role or should they focus on their individual research performance, which is an important determinant of salary increases, promotions, and other financial rewards? We borrow from the macro-level corporate social responsibility literature to conceptualize editorial responsibility in terms of the triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental performance. Our thesis is that there are recursive relationships among the economic, social, and environmental editorial performance dimensions such that editors who do good (i.e., social and environmental performance) also do well (i.e., economic performance). Thus, we bridge micro and macro domains by adapting a macro-level theory to the individual level of analysis and also bridge science and practice by discussing the impact of journal editors and scientific journals on a broad set of stakeholders including universities, research consumers, and society. We also offer suggestions to guide future research on whether the three editorial performance dimensions are part of a virtuous cycle that develops over time through mutually reinforcing feedback loops. © 2011 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.","Ethical dilemma; Ethics; Journal editing; Organizational responsibility; Social performance",,"Aguinis, H.; Indiana UniversityUnited States; email: haguinis@indiana.edu",,,17408776,,,,"English","Manage.

In an attempt to begin to explore the extent to which, if any, the language of human rights has entered the discourse of corporate accountability, this paper investigates the adoption of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) human rights standards by major multinational garment retail companies that source products from developing countries, as disclosed through their reporting media. The paper has three objectives. Firstly, to empirically explore the extent to which a group of multinational garment retailers invoke the language of human rights when disclosing their corporate responsibilities. The paper reviews corporate reporting media including social responsibility codes of conduct, annual reports and stand-alone social responsibility reports released by 18 major global clothing and retail companies during a period from 1990 to 2007. We find that the number of companies adopting and disclosing on the ILO's workplace human rights standards has significantly increased since 1998 - the year in which the ILO's standards were endorsed and accepted by the global community (ILO, 1998). Secondly, drawing on a combination of Responsive Regulation theory and neo-institutional theory, we tentatively seek to understand the regulatory space that may have influenced these large corporations to adopt the language of human rights obligations. In particular, we study the role that International Governmental Organisation's (IGO) such as ILO may have played in these disclosures. Finally, we provide some critical reflections on the power and potential within the corporate adoption of the language of human rights. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Human rights; Institutional theory; International Governmental Organisation; International Labour Organisation; Multinational companies; Responsive regulation",,"Islam, M.A.; School of Accounting, Economics and Finance, Deakin University, Burwood, VIC 3125, Australia; email: azizul.islam@deakin.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal data analysis with a large-sample testing was carried out from 200 Malaysian PLCs by using panel data analysis during a seven-years period. The statistical power with fixed effect and random effect model was utilized. Findings - Results of earlier estimations indicate that there are positive and significant related of the CSR on CFP. Two of the CSR dimensions, namely employee relations and community involvement, were found to be positively related to financial performance. This proves that CSR practices can be considered as effort to enhance the financial performance of PLCs in Malaysia. The results also reveal that there is limited evidence of the relationship between CSR and CFP in the longterm. Practical implications - These findings suggest that Malaysian PLCs should be involved consistently in their CSR practices because CSR has a significant impact on improving financial performance in Malaysian PLCs.

It investigates whether engagement with different stakeholders promotes sustainable innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analysis is based on an international sample of 656 large companies, drawn from the annual assessment for the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. A logistic regression analysis was performed in order to test the hypothesized relationships between stakeholder interaction, knowledge management and sustainable innovation orientation. Findings - Empirical results showed that knowledge sourced from engagement with internal and external stakeholders contributes to a firm's sustainable innovation orientation, but that this knowledge has to be managed by the firm internally in order to be converted into new ideas for innovation. Research limitations/implications - Since the present study represents one of the first attempts to characterize stakeholder-driven innovation in a quantitative way, there are some limitations related to the used database that should be addressed in future research. Practical implications - The results show the importance for companies of connecting the business functions of stakeholder engagement and innovation, and find flexible mechanisms to combine access and transformation of relevant stakeholder information. Originality/value - The main contribution of the present research is to prove quantitatively that engagement with different stakeholders is a valid mechanism for promoting sustainable innovation within firms. This is done with a unique dataset, the SAM Group database. In addition, the present study will advance understanding on firm's sustainable innovation processes by framing this phenomenon as an organizational capability. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

If so, can the strategy work in a B2B context, as well as in the B2C context typically covered by research on corporate responsibility? Finally, how does the geopolitical context of a developing Asian nation affect corporate responsibility, from both a managerial and a stakeholder perspective? Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a case study approach, building from observed data to grounded theory. Findings: In a firm where trust and transparency are both ingrained and enforced among managers, Hayleys PLC used those values as tools to transform relations with key stakeholders from costs to marketing assets. In the process, it created an ethical market network in which membership depends on adherence to the same values. Thus emergent ethical marketplaces are directly related to the spread of CR practices. Research limitations/implications: The effects of transparency beyond financial disclosure or sustainability reporting on stakeholder relations would be a particularly valuable object of further research. The structure of ethical markets, and the costs and benefits of participating in them, require and justify further study. Practical implications: An ethical markets strategy can lead to stable long-term relationships with major buyers. However, in the present circumstances, it also entails dependence on a limited number of major customers. Another issue is that, if ""the factory becomes a sales tool"", it may also kill a sale if and when standards slip or a stakeholder creates conflict. Social implications: A corporate responsibility strategy may transform not only managerial practices, but also the social environment, by enabling or disabling stakeholder partners or adversaries. The means to this objective include providing services and empowerment to stakeholders (in this case, workers) who cannot obtain them from their traditional interlocutors. Originality/value: This paper adds insight into the implications of corporate responsibility for firms involved in B2B markets, as well as for Asian multinationals. It also contributes to answering the question of how corporate responsibility adds value, by demonstrating how corporate responsibility may strengthen key productive and commercial relationships with stakeholders essential to the sustainability of the firm. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Labour relations; Labour unions; Sri Lanka; Stakeholder relations; Stakeholders",,"Hunter, M.

After correcting for endogeneity and simultaneity issues, the results show that CSR engagement positively influences firm value measured by industry-adjusted Tobin's q. We find that the impact of analyst following for firms that engage in CSR on firm value is strongly positive, while the board leadership, board independence, blockholders' ownership, and institutional ownership play a relatively weaker role in enhancing firm value. Furthermore, we find that CSR activities that address internal social enhancement within the firm, such as employees diversity, firm relationship with its employees, and product quality, enhance the value of firm more than other CSR subcategories for broader external social enhancement such as community relation and environmental concerns. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","analyst following; corporate governance; corporate social responsibility; firm value",,"Jo, H.; Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0388, United States; email: hjo@scu.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

In particular this paper concentrates upon the lack of disclosure on three particular eco-justice issues: child labour, equal opportunities and poverty alleviation. We examine why this is the case and thereby illuminate underlying motives behind corporate unwillingness to address these issues. For this purpose, 23 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with senior corporate managers in Bangladesh. The findings suggest that the main reasons for non-disclosure include lack of resources, the profit imperative, lack of legal requirements, lack of knowledge/awareness, poor performance and the fear of bad publicity. Given these findings the paper raises some serious concerns as to why corporations would ever be expected to voluntarily report on eco-justice issues where performance is poor and negative publicity would be generated and profit impaired.

The focus of this article is on the minerals industry, where companies currently face the challenge of matching corporate drivers for strategic partnership with community needs for programmes that contribute to local and regional sustainability. While many global mining companies advocate a strategic approach to partnerships, there is no evidence currently available that suggests companies are monitoring these partnerships to see if they do, in fact, represent 'strategic' investments. This article argues that applying the management concept of 'investment performance' to corporate-community partnerships requires questioning traditional evaluation methods that focus on the results of programmes or activities. We adopt a case study approach to introduce an evaluation framework that considers performance from both corporate and community perspectives and that conceptualises partnership performance as comprising four aspects: (1) the contribution of the partnership to the overall portfolio of a company's community investment programmes, (2) the appropriateness of the partnership model, (3) the effectiveness of the partnering relationship and (4) the ability of the partners to achieve programme goals.

These concepts have been transformed from 'value-adding' propositions to 'value-appropriating' propositions, or in other words, social issues have become business issues. A wide spectrum of views coming from Gen. Bajwa, representing the army; Prof. Chaudhuri and Prof. Bhatta, representing administrative academia; Sri Salvi and Sri Tyagi, endorsing real-life CSR; Mr Ahir and Mr Rayaprolu, representing the corporate; Ms Vatsa and Ms Swami, representing NGOs; and Prof. Sarkar, Prof. Mohanty and Prof. Chatterjee, representing the academicians; along with the presence of Ms M. Bhattacharya from ONGC-all of them have aided and abetted in establishing the contemporary position of CSR as a successful and competitive business proposition. The note addresses the issues developed from their individual experiences and opinions, and attempts to establish, but on an individual level, an intellectual point of departure for an academic discussion of CSR that would initiate further potent research and theorization in this regard. © 2011 Management Centre for Human Values SAGE Publications.","academic; business issues; corporate; CSR; ethics; human value; profit; Socially conscious leadership; value-addition; value-appropriation",,"Rath, P.; Business Ethics and Communication Group, Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, Kolkata, India; email: pragyan@iimcal.ac.in",,,09716858,,,,"English","J.

The study finds evidence that the timing of stock donations is driven by personal tax gain. The study further shows, comparing stock gift corporations relative to their non-stock gift cohorts, that personal stock gifts are associated with lower short-term and long-term stock returns to shareholders. This implies that stock donation driven by insiders' personal gain adversely affects shareholder wealth. However, the likelihood and intensity of insiders to make personal stock donation is reduced when firms have strong corporate social responsibility (CSR). Agency theory explains insiders' opportunistic behavior, stakeholder theory is also supported by evidence that stock donation is negatively related to CSR, and stewardship theory offers a different view to explain the rationale behind insiders' stock donation and shareholders' reactions to stock gifts. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,"Ghosh, S.; Division of Engineering, Business, and Computing, Penn State University, Reading, PA, United States",,,09628770,,,,"English","Bus.

Based on a content analysis of how CSR is presented in two English-language business newspapers with an international readership, we develop a framework for understanding the role of business media setting the corporate CSR agenda. The results show that business media contribute to the construction of what CSR means in corporate practice by creating links between CSR and certain corporate activities, between CSR and arguments that strengthen the view of CSR as a business case, and between CSR and certain spokespersons.

Most of the companies in the Subsea cluster are small to medium-sized companies. Until recently they have not seen or felt the need to make their own understanding or actions regarding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) explicit, even though knowledge about what CSR entails - now often shortened to CR or even SR (Social Responsibility) - may very well already exist in the mindset of managers and employees. However, to respond to potential international customers' demands - often coming from the larger oil companies - SMEs in the Subsea sector are seeking now a way to resolve this by starting a process within their own organizations, using the new process standard ISO 26000. For this reason, the central element of this study focuses on describing such internal processes, which embed CSR knowledge in the respective companies as part of an organizational learning process. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopted a case study method known as Appreciative Inquiry (AI). Findings: The findings show that the initial phases of such processes are extremely important. It is crucial to view the embedding process of CSR/CR as part of a strategic implementation process, which is capable of interlinking and interlocking business goals with human, social and environmental objectives in order to foster a financially and socially responsible business. Originality/value: The two cases provide insights into how ISO 26000 can be adapted by SMEs in order to embed a deeper understanding of CSR into the organization, using a participatory dialogue process. The cases can serve as a model for other SMEs who want to live up to the expectations of their main stakeholders, using a process where strategy, business innovation, personal development and continuous learning are interlocked with understanding social responsibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Appreciative Inquiry; Corporate social responsibility; Dynamic learning process; ISO 26000; Norway; Participatory dialogue; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Strategic management",,"von Weltzien Hoivik, H.; BI Norwegian School of Business, Oslo, Norway; email: Heidi.hoivik@bi.no",,,02621711,,,,"English","J.

The article examines company delistings from the UN Global Compact. Delistings are surprising because the CSR agenda is seen as having won the battle of ideas. The analysis proceeds in two parts. I first analyze firm-level characteristics focusing on geography while controlling for sector and size; I find that geography is a significant factor while small firms are more likely to be delisted than large firms and some sector characteristics determine delistings. Next, I proceed to uncover country-level characteristics including the degree of international economic interdependence as well as the quality of governance institutions. Multivariate regression analysis shows that companies are less likely to be delisted from countries where domestic governance institutions are well-functioning. To a lesser extent, I find that firms from countries with international economies are more willing to comply with the UN Global Compact requirements. Countries with a high share of outward FDI/capita have a lower share of delisted firms as do countries that are internationally competitive. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business/government interaction and relations; corporate social responsibility; country variables; global institutions; political economy",,"Knudsen, J.

Whilst there has been an abundance of global media attention on sporting events such as the Olympics and World Football Cup, there seems to be a lack of integration between the sports marketing and international business disciplines both from a practical and also academic standpoint. This paper aims to discuss international sport marketing and why it is an important attribute of business-to-business marketing. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of the paper is to provide practical implications and research avenues for those seeking to further investigate international sport marketing as a unique area of academic research. The introduction to the paper focuses on the importance of sport to the global economy and how entrepreneurship is ingrained in many sport businesses and organizations. Next, different areas of international business management that relate to entrepreneurial sport marketing ventures are discussed in terms of future research directions and practical implications. These include how entrepreneurial sport ventures affect internationalization, branding, corporate social responsibility, tourism, regional development, marketing and action sports. Findings: The paper concludes by finding that there are numerous research avenues for future research on international sport marketing that combine different areas of marketing together with the sport marketing and international business literature. In addition, there is enormous potential for linking the sports marketing and international business literature through focusing on entrepreneurial sport ventures that occur worldwide. Research limitations/implications: The authors demonstrate the need to take an international perspective of sports marketing and business-to-business relationships.

This case describes the learning and change process within the company that set the ground for today's success. Design/methodology/approach: This teaching case builds on data gathered through sites visits, interviews and company materials. The case research protocol explored the notion that the company was learning how to interact, and respond to its changing context, while its responses were creating the ground for internal organisational change that in turn would impact the relationship between the company and its context. Findings: While on the surface the change process which Sabaf experienced can be regarded as a move from an implicit to a more explicit approach to corporate responsibility, it is also possible to take the view that the company was engaged in developing a more ""humanistic"" approach to management that permeated the whole organization. What became explicit at Sabaf was not corporate responsibility but rather the term ""corporate responsibility"" used to describe much older concepts of business that valued people and the natural environment alongside economics. The case also shows the process of organizational leadership for learning, management innovation and change that supported the processes through which this approach was developed and integrated into the company. Originality/value: This case provides unique insights into the approach Sabaf adopted in its pioneering transformation to become a leading corporate responsibility company and a world leader in its sector. This case can be used as a benchmark for other companies that might embark on the process of integrating corporate responsibility and business performance as a strategic process that has effects that cut across the business as a whole. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Corporate responsibility; Humanistic approach to management; Learning organizations; Strategic CR",,"Roome, N.; Vlerick Leuven Gent Management School, Gent, Belgium; email: nigel.roome@vlerick.com",,,02621711,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: To identify firms involving stakeholders in their governance arrangements, the authors analysed 51 companies regularly participating in Business in the Community's Corporate Responsibility Index in the UK. The data provided by the index as well as corporate reports were then analysed to evaluate the impact of JMSCs on corporate decision-making. Findings: The research finds that JMSCs strongly influence corporate governance mechanisms such as monitoring and measurement as well as the policy development of firms. Research limitations/applications: The analysis builds on corporate responses given to the questionnaire sent by the Corporate Responsibility Index as well as corporate reports. Future research is encouraged to triangulate findings with stakeholder opinions on the effectiveness of JMSCs. Practical implications: JMSCs prove to be an effective tool to involve stakeholders in corporate decision-making processes. Owing to their effectiveness JMSCs are more likely to create trust between firms and their stakeholders.

The paper describes and analyzes one possible tool local governments have in order to encourage SMEs to become more efficient from an environmental standpoint-the Ecoprofit-type approach. Ecoprofit is a program implemented in Austria and then extended to other countries in which local governments offer training and certificates to SMEs who want to become more eco-efficient. In the empirical research we tested: a) the perceptions and attitudes of SMEs with regard to the greening of their operations and products/ services; and b) whether Romanian SMEs would be interested in taking part in such a program. The conclusion is that SMEs perceive environmental management as a burden and tend to comply only with the mandatory requirements of the law.","Eco-efficiency; Ecoprofit; Environmental responsibility; Public-private partnerships; Romania; Small and medium enterprises",,"Neamţu, B.; Public Administration Department, Faculty of Political, Administrative and Communication Sciences, Babeş-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania; email: bogdananeamtu@apubb.ro",,,18422845,,,,"English","Transylv.

As sport events are intensive in stakeholders' relationships, the creation and strengthening of networks among these stakeholders should be a first priority of strategies aiming at building events' legacies. The purpose of this study is to explore the generation of effective networks in a regional triathlon event using social network analysis theory and techniques. Ten key stakeholders from the sports and tourism areas were interviewed before and after the first edition of the event in 2009 and the data collected were analyzed by means of social network analysis software. Findings indicate that there is an evolution in the structure and complexity of the network, affecting both the social, personal and economic components of relationships and the connectivity among local and external stakeholders. Subsequent implications for managers are drawn to plan strategies that ensure the effectiveness of the event in terms of positive legacies. © 2011 Copyright European Association for Sport Management.","event; impact; network; Sport tourism; stakeholder",,"Sallent, O.; Departament de Ciéncies Socials, Facultat d'Educació-Ciéncies de l'Activitat Física i l'Esport, University of Vic, C.

It examines whether MNEs' adherence to global standards (as adopted by e. g.

Stricter enforcement mechanisms did not result in stronger harmonization. • Our findings imply that global standards and guidelines do not only increase the overall level of CSR reporting, but are also associated with a harmonization of CSR activities of firms from different countries, thus reducing the role that domestic institutions (including legislation and societal concerns) play in shaping CSR practices.

Personal values and education concerning CSR are considered as interactive factors affecting the influence of perceptions of corporate citizenship. Results indicate that perceived corporate citizenship had a greater impact on job applicant attraction for those individuals who received prior education regarding CSR and for those who were higher in other-regarding value orientation.

In an attempt to identify the best practices regarding CSR and trends therein we developed a CSR benchmarking of companies from the real estate sector owning and developing shopping centres. Based on information from websites, annual, environmental and sustainability reports, and customer services department's information, in 2004 and 2010, a comparative CSR benchmarking was performed on 23 real estate companies with shopping centres based in Europe, China, Australia and the USA. The CRS benchmarking framework focused on reported CSR practices and included categories and sub-categories of evaluation in four domains: (1) external results, (2) internal results, (3) management processes and (4) learning and innovation. The framework was inspired by the sustainability balanced scorecard structure. The United Kingdom real estate sector's companies studied did relatively well when evaluated by the framework used in this study.

Rather than extending the multiple perspectives on CSR, this study aimed to identify a method of recognising CSR-related issues, before applying it to two dissimilar case studies on critical infrastructure resilience. One case study was of an international telecommunications company based in the US while the other was of the railway network in Britain during a period of privatisation. The method used was derived from Okoye's (J Bus Ethics 89(4):613-627, 2009) common reference core for CSR. Both case studies satisfied all the criteria sought which points to critical infrastructure resilience as being an emerging CSR issue. Because ongoing change characterises CSR, the method may have application for identifying future new CSR strands. As the findings suggest that some aspects of national and global security are CSR-related phenomena, the study demonstrates how CSR research may be significant at a societal, national and global level.

In the study's proposed model, purchase intention is indirectly affected by perceived CA, negative publicity, and CSR via the mediation of trust and affective identification.

First, it develops a model of strategic competition that includes consumer perceptions with respect to firm social performance. It is shown that in the presence of a positive valuation of social responsibility practices by consumers, a firm that endorses this responsible behaviour may obtain a better strategic position in the market, along with higher margin, demand, and profit. Second, the model's predictions are tested with a sample of Spanish banking firms. The empirical analysis confirms that consumers significantly value other features apart from price in making deposit and mortgage decisions, particularly a financial institution's social responsibility. A more disaggregated analysis shows first, that not every CSR dimension has relevance for consumers and second, that customers equally value activities that can have a direct impact on their well-being (e.g., culture and leisure), as well as other activities that can be viewed more generally as public goods (e.g., heritage and the environment). These conclusions are of interest in the debate about a firm's social or ethical activities. It is shown that, provided that consumers value corporate social responsibility activities, firms can improve both their competitive position in the market and their profits by behaving in a socially responsible manner. Therefore, the design and implementation of corporate social responsibility practices could confer upon firms an initial competitive advantage over their competitors. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Hotelling's model; Spanish banking; Strategic competition",,"Callado-Muñoz, F.J.; Economics Department, Universitat de Girona, Girona, 17071, Spain; email: franciscojose.callado@udg.edu",,,13547798,,,,"English","Eur.

Characteristically, stakeholder studies of environmental management have concentrated on stakeholder influence or the creation of stakeholder management models. In contrast to those, the present study identifies different types of stakeholder relationships: power-based, collaborative, conflicting, and one-sided. Through descriptions of those relationships, business actors participate in the power to define responsibility, share responsibility among actors, question environmental interest, and justify environmental impacts. The results of the study demonstrate that, when regarding environmental issues in business, instead of analysing single stakeholder attributes or a single stakeholder relationship, business professionals should be able to manage differences in stakeholder relationships.

The notion of identity-based views of the firm is held to be highly meaningful to the comprehension of corporate marketing. In addition, the paper aims to broaden the understanding of the antecedents of corporate marketing by making reference to earlier, integrative endeavours (sensory integration, design integration, communications integration, branding integration and identity integration). Design/methodology/approach: The commentary explains the nature, antecedents, and benefits of an organisation-wide corporate marketing logic. Findings: A corporate marketing logic characterises those institutions, which realise that institutions and corporate brands can be important sources of differentiation. Moreover, it is held that organisations need to be involved in multi-lateral relationships vis-à-vis customers, stakeholders and with society at large. It is also mindful that an organisational marketing orientation should accord sensitivity to CSR/ethical concerns. A key precept of the corporate marketing logic is that it is institution-wide ethos which is enacted via an organisation's culture. A long and short definition of corporate marketing is provided. Practical implications: Perceiving organisational marketing via the prism of identity-based views of the firm and utilising the new corporate marketing mix (the 8Cs of corporate marketing) affords a practical and pragmatic means by which senior managers can foster and maintain a corporate marketing ethos and culture. Originality/value: A corporate marketing framework is introduced which is informed by: identity-based views of the firm perspectives; and by key corporate-level constructs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate brands; Corporate identity; Corporate image; Corporate marketing; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate strategy; Organisational change; Organisational marketing",,"Balmer, J.

Unfortunately, financial accounting systems often fail to fully disclose these environmentally-related costs. The reasons underlying this incomplete disclosure are myriad, ranging from measurement issues to the structure of the firm's chart of accounts. In many ways, the issues facing managers and stakeholders who are attempting to assess environmental costs arising from business operations resemble the issues faced when attempting to determine the costs of producing poor quality products. The negative impact on the environment from business operations can be viewed as a failure in the same way that the negative impact of producing a defective product can be seen as a production control failure. Similarly, costs are incurred to prevent and detect environmental failures, and the cost of failure-particularly if not addressed within the firm-can be huge and unknowable. Drawing on the experiences of firms employing quality measures and reporting, this article presents an environmental cost reporting model to provide greater transparency on environmental impact of business operations to managers and firm stakeholders. © 2011 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental costs; Environmental reporting; Risk reduction",,"Raiborn, C.A.; McCoy College of Business, Texas State University-San Marcos, 601 University Drive, San Marcos, TX 78666, United States; email: craiborn@txstate.edu",,,00076813,,BHORA,,"English","Bus.

One difficulty is the possible inexactness of CSR. Another is the apparent reluctance by regulatory authorities and policy makers to intervene in the area. This is largely a result of inhibitions created by traditional approaches to company law with emphasis on shareholder protection and financial disclosure. The consequence is the stultification of independent development of CSR by tying social issues to financial performance. This attitude might not be unconnected to the theoretical and practical challenges in justifying CSR and defining its scope. The underlying impediment is a factual and theoretical failure to distinguish 'instrumental' and 'pure' (ethical) CSR. This article demonstrates that ethical CSR highlights the role of regulation, and a principal stance is that regulation is neither incompatible nor irreconcilable with ethical CSR. The article argues that cognizance of the intrinsic moral justification of 'pure' CSR is required for delineating the scope of CSR as well as for clarifying the desirability and extent of its regulation. It argues that the dynamic history and visage of multinational corporate corruption illuminates the fluidity of the regulation-CSR relationship. The current and widening backlash against transnational corporate corruption is, arguably, a demonstration of the position that regulation and CSR are not mutually exclusive and absolute concepts. This article submits that recognition and application of this 'ethical' and 'instrumental' CSR distinction is fundamental to the development of CSR and resolution of connected questions of regulation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","bribery; Bribery Act 2010; corporate social responsibility; corruption; globalization; pluralism; regulation",,"Osuji, O.; School of Law, College of Social Sciences and International Studies, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Penryn Cornwall TR10 9EZ, United Kingdom; email: O.K.Osuji@exeter.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Specifically, the paper compiles a new theoretical framework drawing on a multi-level model of institutional flows by Scott (Institutions and organizations: ideas and interests, 2008) and the explicit/implicit CSR model by Matten and Moon (Acad Manag Rev 33(2):404-424, 2008). This new theoretical framework is then used to explore the CSR convergence versus divergence question in a developing country context. The findings highlight the usefulness of the compiled multi-layered institutional framework and the varied nuances and profound insights it offers in analyzing CSR in context. They also suggest that a cosmetic level of global convergence in explicit CSR may materialize in light of mimetic isomorphic pressures, but that the path dependence hypothesis is indeed salient in light of national history trajectories and socio-politico configurations. The findings correspond most closely to patterns of CSR crossvergence, combining elements of both convergence and divergence, and reflecting in complex hybridized CSR expressions.

Although prior research has addressed the direct influence of proactive and reactive CSR on consumer responses, this research hypothesized that consumers' perceived organizational motives (i. e., attributions) will mediate this relationship. It was also hypothesized that the source of information and location of CSR initiative will affect the motives consumers assign to a firms' engagement in the initiative. Two experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses. The results of Study 1 indicate that the nature of a CSR initiative influences consumer attribution effects and that these attributions act as mediators in helping to explain consumers' responses to CSR. Study 2 suggests that the source of the CSR message moderates the effect of CSR on consumer attributions. The mediating influence of the attributions as well as the importance of information source suggests that proper communication of CSR can be a viable way to inculcate positive corporate associations and purchase intentions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","consumer attributions; corporate communications; corporate social responsibility; CSR strategy; information source",,"Groza, M.

The antithesis of CSR is embodied in executive corruption and malfeasance. Unfortunately such things are all too frequent. We view the degree of centrality of leadership, and the primary power motivation of leaders, as key factors that influence the engagement in corruptive leader behavior and consequent corporate social ir-responsibility (CSIR) in organizations. Shared and self-leadership, on the other hand, we introduce as alternatives to traditional top-down centralized views of leadership that can establish needed checks and balances capable of reducing corruptive tendencies.

The first part will argue that practices of customer co-production raise a serious challenge to established theories of value. The second part will suggest that these new practices, although widely disparate in nature, do move according to a common logic of value, and that this new value logic can be fruitfully organized around the concept of 'ethics'. Let me clarify already here that I intend 'ethics' in the sense of the ability to create the values that 'make a multitude into a community' (Marazzi, 2008: 66). As I will further elaborate below, this concept of ethics is closer to the original Aristotelian sense of that term, than to the Kantian ethics that has been central to modern, enlightenment discourse. My use of 'ethics', in this, Aristotelian sense, is not taken out of the blue. Rather, I propose that a notion of value based on ethics is already emerging within a range of cutting-edge economic practices involving aspects of customer co-production - from corporate social responsibility (CSR) to Open Source production and brand valuation. In other words, I am not proposing a new notion of value as I would like it to be, but I am pointing at actually existing trends and developments. However, since these developments are emergent they cannot be grasped as fully formed facts. My ambition in the second part of this paper is thus limited to suggesting a theoretical framework within which these emergent tendencies can be read in a novel way; and from which a more definite shape can be discerned. © The Author(s) 2011.","brand; commons; customer co-production; ethics; information economy; value",,"Arvidsson, A.; University of Milan, Department of Social and Political Studies, via Conservatorio 7, 20122 Milano, Italy; email: adam.arvidsson@unimi.it",,,14705931,,,,"English","Mark.

In short, this research set out to answer the following research questions: What are the different types of change agents for sustainability, in terms of their existential needs? What are the motivations and frustrations faced by sustainability managers as change agents? and How are the motivations and frustrations of sustainability managers framed by the sources of meaning in their life and work? Design/methodology/approach: As the research is still at an exploratory stage, a qualitative methodology was adopted. This methodology was also appropriate for the purpose of this research, which was focused on studying how meaning emerges and changes in situated organizational settings. The authors were engaged in 27 value-laden semi-structured interviews where they were looking to build a close relationship between the researcher and what was studied. The interview process was divided into three phases to ensure the planning and validity of the process. Findings: It identifies four such categories of sustainability managers, those being Scientist, Messenger, Artist and Storyteller. The findings suggest the key role of expertise, empowerment, values, inspiration, strategic thinking and social contribution as key meaning for these managers. The empirical findings help build on understanding of the different psychological dimensions of corporate sustainability management, and provides a useful tool for developing effective organizational leadership, enhancing recruitment and retention of sustainability talent, and improving individual and team performance for key sustainability growth. Originality/value: This research has helped to deal application of existential psychology theories to complement corporate sustainability. The findings more or less confirm the usability of major existential psychology theories to find sources of motivations of sustainability managers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Artisan; Change agents; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability; Environmental champions; Meaning in life; Messenger; Psychology; Scientist; Storyteller; Sustainability managers; Values",,"Tang, K.; Bond University, Gold Coast, Australia; email: KTang@bond.edu.au",,,00251747,,,,"English","Manage.

It deepens the understanding of corporate environmentalism and seeks to disseminate best practice among hospitality managers. The programme's distinctive and innovative character as well as its weaknesses and strengths are highlighted. Barriers to behavioural change in hotel operation are discussed. The programme involved over 16,000 employees, created hotel-specific action teams linking all employee levels and reduced energy use per square metre by 15%, water use and CO2 emissions per guest night by 8% each over three years. Avoided utility costs totalled US$16 million, of which US$9.6 million can be attributed to changes in human behaviour. The paper makes a case for a holistic approach that combines the introduction of IT-based measurement and performance-assessing tools with genuine employee empowerment and green awareness raising.

The study follows Bushee (Account Rev 73(3):305-333, 1998) in categorising institutions as dedicated or transient. The demand for shares is organised according to three factors: a long-term factor, corporate responsibility; a short-term factor, market liquidity; and a time-independent factor, portfolio theory. The rank and importance of the factors for the different types of institutional investor are analysed. For one of two types of dedicated institution, corporate responsibility is as important as portfolio theory in influencing the demand for shares. For all dedicated institutions, corporate responsibility influences the demand for shares more than market liquidity. For two of the three types of transient institution, market liquidity is the most important factor in share selection. For all transient institutions, the least important factor is corporate responsibility. Findings suggest that corporate responsibility positively and significantly influences the demand for shares by dedicated institutions. The discussion considers the extent to which these trends are constitutive of significant shifts in ethicality within the context of institutional investment. Looking at this from within a highly institutionalised Anglo market model, dedicated institutions' commitment to broader and longer-term concerns could be interpreted as a small but significant step towards a more axiologically informed ethical business practice. Such a form of engagement calls for sensitive attention to a fuller range of features deemed to be relevant to investment decisions, as opposed to more narrow reliance on legislation, codes of practice and fiduciary principles. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; corporate responsibility; institutional investment; share ownership",,"Cox, P.; Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham, University House, Edgbaston Park Road, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom; email: p.cox@bham.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

This is one significant reason it is currently believed that in order for scientists to exercise a reliable ethical reflection about their research it is necessary for them to engage in dialogue with other stakeholders. This paper reports on an exercise to encourage a group of scientists to reflect on ethical issues without the presence of external stakeholders. It reports on the use of a reflection process with scientists working in the area of animal disease genomics (mainly drawn from the EADGENE EC Network of Excellence). This reflection process was facilitated by using an ethical engagement framework, a modified version of the Ethical Matrix. As judged by two criteria, a qualitative assessment of the outcomes and the participants' own assessment of the process, this independent reflective exercise was deemed to be successful. The discussions demonstrated a high level of complexity and depth, with participants demonstrating a clear perception of uncertainties and the context in which their research operates. Reflection on stakeholder views and values appeared to be embedded within the discussions. The finding from this exercise seems to indicate that even without the involvement of the wider stakeholder community, valuable reflection and worthwhile discourse can be generated from ethical reflection processes involving only scienitific project partners. Hence, the previous assumption that direct stakeholder engagement is necessary for ethical reflection does not appear to hold true in all cases; however, other reasons for involving a broad group of stakeholders relating to governance and social accountability of science remain. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Animal disease genomics; Ethical matrix; Ethical reflection; Ethics; Participatory methods; Stakeholder engagement","animal; article; attitude; bioethics; demography; ethics; genomics; group process; human; perception; research ethics; social behavior; social psychology; uncertainty; Animals; Attitude; Bioethical Issues; Ethics, Research; Genomics; Group Processes; Humans; Perception; Residence Characteristics; Social Responsibility; Social Values; Uncertainty","Jensen, K.

First, we set the context in which business unusual is evolving, a context of ""wicked problems""uncertainty, and sustainability problems. Then we provide an overview of new types of enterprises that are already emerging to cope with these changes, enterprises of the cloud (interlinked, web-based enterprises that rely on the ""cloud"" of computers that store data such as social media, eBay, and Google). Next, we outline how such enterprises are permitting processes of dematerialization and ""servicization"" (the shift from product to services) to create new forms of enterprise that are less dependent on physical resources. From here, we explore what we term enterprise unusual, corporations that incorporate pro-social goals into their very essence, for example, for-benefit corporations, the B Corporation, and conscious capitalism companies, along with a few entities that are shaping their product development along the lines of biomimicry. All of this change, we argue, has created a blurring of sector boundaries evidenced in the rapid emergence of social enterprise, of which explore a variety of types, and what is being called the fourth sector, where business purpose and pro-social activity are combined. © 2011 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,,"Waddock, S.; Boston College, Carroll School of Management, Chestnut Hill, MA, United States; email: waddock@bc.edu",,,00453609,,,,"English","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach: Industry case studies, of the finance and cleaning industries, were undertaken as part of a national research project on quality in traineeships. The two industry case studies were analysed to provide data on social inclusion aspects. A general discussion on the ""pros"" and ""cons"" of gaining qualifications through work, from a social inclusion point of view, is included. Findings: The industry case studies show many advantages of work-based qualifications for people who have had disadvantaged economic and social backgrounds. The study presents a model showing how work-based qualifications help to meet the twin social inclusion goals of employment and education. However in economic hard times, the need to have a job may rule out some people. Also, some doubts about quality in work-based delivery may mean that qualifications gained through work may be of lower value than those gained at least partly through formal study. Research limitations/implications: The models put forward are tentative, based on the findings in the research study that has been described and the authors' earlier research. Further research is necessary to establish the social inclusion benefits of this means of gaining qualifications. In particular longitudinal research with disadvantaged people who have gained qualifications through this route is needed to evaluate whether their completion of qualifications through employment has assisted their broader economic and social engagement, and in what ways. In addition, research is needed to compare the quality and utility of qualifications gained through work and those through education providers as a poor-quality qualification may be of limited long-term use to an individual. Practical implications: Work-based qualifications are shown to be a useful investment of public resources. The research also analyses some shortcomings of this method of gaining qualifications so that they can be addressed by employers and training providers. Social implications: The research establishes the social inclusion utility of work-based qualifications, providing insights useful for education systems and social welfare organisations. Originality/value: This is one of very few scholarly studies of the large-scale use of work-based qualifications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Banking; Cleaning; Indigenous people; Social inclusion; VET qualifications; Vocational training; Work-based learning",,"Smith, E.; University of Ballarat, Ballarat, Australia; email: e.smith@ballarat.edu.au",,,00400912,,,,"English","Educ.

Perhaps. However, more often than not, both are treated as, and are perceived by customers to be, little more than public relations tools in the promotion of brand. This perception reflects the reality that companies are struggling with how to operationalize the concepts of social and environmental responsibility, while maintaining a fair return to shareholders. The struggle arises because in this area, real change requires thinking about organizational purpose in ways that challenge deeply rooted values. In fact, it involves instilling and managing a change in the innate organizational culture. As such, this paper will view the operationalization of social environmental performance through the lens of the change management literature. The process by which change occurs, as well the factors which drive or impede green change in particular will serve as the framework for this paper.

Communities need industry to provide economic stability and innovation, while corporations rely on society for infrastructure, and stability. In the early part of the 20th century, literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) emphasized industry's social obligation to do no harm. It contained specific ethical imperatives that called for business to bear responsibility for the effects that their decisions had on society at large. By the end of World War II, corporations grew larger and more distant from the communities that they served. Competing discourses that questioned the importance of CSR also emerged at this time. In an attempt to remain relevant, CSR scholars shifted away from the normative approach and began publishing studies that demonstrated how CSR could positively affect financial and strategic performance of the firm. Business responded to this shift by applying CSR to maintain their customer base and to improve their financial and strategic performance. Although well-intentioned, the shift toward a performance-based model of CSR has had deleterious effects. It is argued here that this shift has significantly narrowed the field of CSR, and has diluted, if not eradicated, the do-no-harm standard in its most basic form. This paper traces the breakdown of the social compact between business and society, and provides a parallel view of the literature as it too departs from earlier socially-minded themes. Specific recommendations for recapturing a do-no-harm agenda is also discussed. © Common Ground, Leah Ritchie, All Rights Reserved.","Corporate social responsibility; Minimum behavioral standard; Stakeholders",,"Ritchie, L.; Salem State College, MAUnited States",,,14479524,,,,"English","Int.

Based on the results obtained, it proposes to draw implications for emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach: Combining content analysis of CSR reports and corporate social performance data, the paper built a longitudinal dataset starting from the population of worldwide companies included in the AccountAbility Rating between 2004 and 2007. Longitudinal regression analysis is performed on a final sample size of 114 firm-year observations involving 38 firms over a three-year period. Findings: The paper finds evidence that the level of disclosure does not improve firm ability to manage stakeholders. However, a finer-grained analysis of the structure of disclosure shows that better social performers are those who increased the breadth of their disclosure to stakeholders and uniformly distributed disclosure across stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: Results provide an empirical test for the theories describing true responsible economic actors as those who are able to combine high engagement with the social context of reference and balanced coverage of diversified interests. However, the study suffers the usual limitations of content analysis-based research, as well as exclusively relying on CSR disclosure by large corporations. Practical implications: Findings suggest not only the importance of structuring the report in a comprehensive way, and extending coverage to multiple stakeholders and related issues, but also the need for balance between informative needs, thus avoiding concentrated structures. Accordingly, companies that report on more themes, presenting a balanced and comprehensive product, develop a better ability to manage their stakeholder network, thus gaining higher corporate social performance. Originality/value: The study seeks to revisit the relation between CSR disclosure and corporate social performance, answering the request for more rigorous measures. It goes beyond the level of disclosure as a comprehensive proxy of firm-stakeholder dialogue and demonstrates how a finer-grained analysis of the structure of disclosure can be a better predictor of superior performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; CSR disclosure and reporting; Emerging markets; Social responsibility",,"Vurro, C.; Department of Management and Technology, Università Commerciale Luigi Bocconi, Milan, Italy; email: clodia.vurro@unibocconi.it",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

It seeks to focus on how to measure both business and community benefits derived from CCI, especially stressing the need for developing indicators beyond the input level considering outputs and impacts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper follows a case study research strategy in a subsidiary of a multinational chemical and pharmaceutical company. Data collection is based on triangulation of data using interviews, action research, and documents. Findings: Based on the case study presented, it was found that, when CCI is an integral part of corporate strategy, it is also possible to develop advanced performance measurement systems for CCI. Such measurement systems include input, output, and impact level metrics for both community and business benefits. Community benefits are best developed and monitored in collaboration with the NGO partner. Further, it was found that the measuring frequency partly transcends conventional reporting periods. Practical implications: The research should motivate companies that engage in corporate community involvement to go beyond input-level metrics in measuring the success of such initiatives. However, in order to successfully operate a performance monitoring on output and impact levels, partnering with an NGO that has greater capability in socio-economic assessments is key.

Findings: The study finds that the CSR approach that is most favored by Indian firms is the stakeholder approach and that the caring or the moral motive, followed by the strategic or profit motive, are important drivers for Indian firms to pursue CSR. Further, the results indicate that the most significant obstacles to CSR implementation are those related to lack of resources, followed by those related to the complexity and difficulty of implementing CSR.

It focuses on discursive and rhetorical activity through which firms and NGOs jointly - and not always consciously - define boundaries for socially acceptable corporate behavior. It explores the discursive legitimation struggles of a leading Finnish forest industry company StoraEnso and Greenpeace during 1985-2001 and examines how these struggles participated in the (re)definition and institutionalization of corporate social responsibility. I find a mixture of rational and moral struggles as a key feature of this legitimation work and show how different manifestations of these struggles act as a central mechanism that redefines what the boundaries of corporate responsibility are in a specific setting at a given point of time. The study illustrates how the actors' ability to sense the public's views contribute to rhetorical difficulties of the industry and unintended societal consequences for the activists, and how the rational and moral struggles build up in time to trigger changes in the actors' sensemaking and actions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate social responsibility; discourse analysis; forest industry; legitimacy; NGO; rhetorical analysis",,"Joutsenvirta, M.; Department of Management and International Business, Aalto University School of Economics, P.O.

With this study, I aim to significantly advance the empirical analysis of the CSR discourse for a better understanding of facts and fiction in the process of institutionalization of CSR in MNCs. I conducted 42 semi-structured face-to-face and phone interviews in two rounds with 30 corporate managers from three multinational companies. The data has been analyzed using qualitative (multiple coding) and quantitative (ANOVA, χ2 analysis) techniques. The findings indicate that one company is driven by civil society's influence on consumer's perception, the second company by direct attacks by civil society, agenda setting organizations and legislators, and the third by the pressure of large customers and legislators. The results suggest that the coping behaviors of MNCs at both extremes of the spectrum of perceived responsible behavior aim at (1) improving the business case for CSR and (2) increasing legitimacy in society, resulting in converging CSR perceptions, and fostering an institutionalization of CSR. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","case study research; corporate social responsibility; institutional entrepreneurs; legitimacy",,"Richter, U.

Within this scope, the objective is to identify accurately and extensively: CSR practices at the social, economic and environmental levels; the motivations, perceived benefits, existing obstacles; and the types of support and strategies that render possible an explanation of the factors which place the greatest restrictions on SME adoption of CSR practices. Design/methodology/approach - This research was realized through the completion of a questionnaire type inquiry structured around table-based analysis. The questionnaire was sent out to a large sample of SMEs in Portugal. Findings - The main results demonstrate that, while CSR takes on an informal, non-structured character, it has been incorporated into the daily management of such companies. Furthermore, contrary to what happens at large companies, CSR at SMEs is fundamentally internally focused and results from attention to the potential benefits to the business from gains in eco-efficiency, a better social climate or a higher profile in the local community. The emphasis is on the adoption of simple, easily applicable and cheap measures and normally with specific results exemplifying how SME CSR is located on the border between entrepreneurialism and business management and that of business citizenship. Research limitations/implications - It is not possible to extrapolate the data obtained since the study focused only on mainland Portugal. Practical implications - The fact that the study clarifies the strategies and motivations of CSR in SMEs makes possible the development of active policies to promote CSR in the universe of these companies. Originality/value - Because the studies on SME CSR remain rare, this research contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics, motivations and strategies of CSR in the SMEs case.

Design/methodology/approach - By drawing on existing CSR literature the achievements and gaps of CSR are demonstrated. The literature review focuses on a small selection of important CSR models, referencing the most iconic from the last few decades. Findings - Existing CSR models are critiqued as being insufficient in providing an adequate understanding of CSR. It is asserted that a more efficient model of CSR is required and a new model of CSR is proposed, which is more relevant to and reflective of the present day business environment. The model of ""consumer-driven corporate responsibility"" (CDCR) is founded on the notion that consumer demand for CSR is both the most likely and the most effective driver for the implementation of CSR in a company. Research limitations/implications - As CSR is rapidly evolving, undoubtedly models will be created after this paper was written, that, for this reason, are out of the scope of this review. Practical implications - This paper provides an alternative, more comprehensive and more effective model of CSR, useful as a tool for academics and business leaders alike. Originality/value - As the model of CDCR focuses on the conditions under which companies are most likely to adopt CSR from both a descriptive and normative perspective, it is proposed as being a more suitable approach to CSR.

It is intended to make clear the phenomena about the relationship between audit risk (AR), implementation of business ethics principles (IBEP) and corporate governance risk (CGR). Design/methodology/approach - The method used was hypothesis testing. Unit of analysis was individual (i.e. Indonesian CPA), and the gathering of data was cross-sectional. The sample was determined by purposive sampling. Data were collected using questionnaires, and data analysis was conducted by structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings - According to Indonesian CPAs' perception, the AR is affected by the client's CGR, whereas the client's IBEP does not affect AR, but clients' CGR and IBEP both significantly affect AR. It is suggested: first, that the next researcher should study audit risk related to business ethics. Second, that the management should strengthen the implementation of business ethics in running a business; and finally that the Bapepam (Capital Market Oversight Board) should oversee both public company and public accountant in the implementation of governance. Research limitations/implications - This research noted some implications, including: nature and intensity of gathering data, restricted respondent (CPA-CMAF), and restricted variables of corporate governance (BoD, and Audit Committee). Originality/value - This research suggests the necessity to modify ARM by dividing inherent risk into errors risk and fraud risk as bases for accumulating audit evidence.

According to the investigation of Chinese companies, this paper aims to use stakeholder theory to answer this question. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical framework is proposed based on the stakeholder theory by defining nine kinds of stakeholders and viewing the companies taking CSR as giving responses to the interest requirement of these stakeholders. Some agent variables are also set to depict CFP. Subsequently, this paper uses the data collected in 2007 and 2008 from Chinese firms to explore the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) empirically. Findings: The results show that companies' social responsibility activity can improve their financial performances of the current year, have significant effects on their financial performances of the next year, and vice versa. The variation of CSR and financial performance can also significantly influence each other.

Our data revealed that CSR's link with GTM strategy is taken more seriously in the UK than in Korea.

In 2008, Mallen Baker administered a simple online voting poll which resulted in the majority of respondents predicting either cutting back or stopping CSR activities in response to extended economic recession. This study now aims to garner detailed views across a range of UK organisations in order to assess the resilience of their CSR activities together with capturing the key drivers behind their intentions. A survey approach has been adopted, with responses gained from 121 members of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, all of whom were senior executives, directors or managers. Results show that the most common reason for undertaking CSR was ""it's just the right thing to do"", indicating relational and moral motives that go beyond pure instrumentalism, although compliance to regulation is also a factor. Respondents (70.3%) were content with their organisation's current levels of CSR activity and 29.7% felt that they were doing too little CSR. Over the next 5. years, 90.8% of respondents predicted an increase in environmentally responsible activity and 88.3% predicted an increase in socially responsible actions (within which a significant number were forecasting a substantial increase). Various drivers behind this forecast increase in CSR activity are given. This study therefore finds that CSR appears to be a more resilient concept than some previous reports have suggested. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Change; Corporate Social Responsibility; CSR; Procurement; Resilience; Supply",,"Harwood, I.; School of Management, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom; email: iah@soton.ac.uk",,,02632373,,,,"English","Eur.

A qualitative analysis of participant responses to open-ended questions was conducted to generate results. Findings - There is a substantial portion of US consumers who are unaware of socially responsible companies compared with their Indian counterparts who failed to recognize the CSR initiatives of multinational companies.

It is found, based on interviews and document analysis, that processes of stakeholder consultation relating to these initiatives are characterised by debate and a plurality of different viewpoints. However, this polyphony can be contrasted sharply with the institutional outcomes of these processes. Institutional outcomes represent the viewpoints of only a subset of the actors involved in the stakeholder consultation processes. It is consequently inferred that stakeholder consultation processes serve problematic functions: on one level, these processes legitimise dominant discourses on CSR by giving the impression that the latter are the outcome of a democratic dialogue that is free from power relations; on another level, these processes themselves show to heretic social actors the futility of their heresy and thus encourage those actors to actively adopt the dominant discourse. We conclude that business capture of Corporate Social Responsibility is ingrained into institutional processes in that domain. This raises serious questions regarding the potential for civil society actors to engage with and move the signifier of Corporate Social Responsibility in a more challenging direction. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,,"Spence, C.; Universidad Pública de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; email: crawfordspence@gmail.com",,,03613682,,,,"English","Account.

The current research examines CSR from the consumer's perspective, focusing on antecedents and consequences of perceived CSR. The findings strongly support the fact that particular cues, namely perceived financial performance and perceived quality of ethics statements, influence perceived CSR which in turn impacts perceptions of corporate reputation, consumer trust, and loyalty. Both consumer trust and loyalty were also found to reduce the perceived risk that consumers experience in buying and using products. From these significant findings, we draw several conclusions and implications, including the importance of enhancing firm focus toward its ethical commitment and long-term reputation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate marketing; Corporate social responsibility; Ethics statements; Stakeholders",,"Stanaland, A.

This study explores this question in the context of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) in South Africa. BEE has helped to drive the transformation in the economic, political and social landscapes of post-apartheid South Africa. It strives to increase black wealth through the sale of an equity stake in a company to black empowerment groups. Thus, BEE appears to represent corporate social responsibility that benefits the previously disadvantaged population. This inductive study investigates whether BEE can represent a value-creating CSR action and under what conditions. We explore the economic impact of BEE for the shareholders and find that South African firms that engaged in BEE transactions that were completed at a discount experienced positive and significant average shareholder returns. However, the firms that engaged in BEE transactions that were completed at a premium experienced negative and significant average shareholder returns. Furthermore, for empowerment deals completed at a discount, the size of the equity stake was positively associated with shareholder returns. Our analysis suggests that the CSR aspects of BEE deals created value when pursued in earnest, but destroyed value otherwise. We offer several implications from our findings for managers. We also link the insights from our findings to implications for stewardship theory, signalling theory and broader CSR perspectives. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Corporate social responsibility; Economic empowerment; Economic impacts; Equity stake; Shareholder returns; South Africa; Investments; Shareholders; Industry; corporate strategy; economic development; economic impact; empowerment; equity; political relations; post-apartheid; social impact; South Africa","Alessandri, T.M.",,,00246301,,,,"English","Long Range Plann.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959804274

Organizational researchers have identified several distinct CSR strategies (e. g., obstructionist, defensive, accommodative, and proactive), but did not explain the sources of divergence. This article argues that the divergence comes from the variability in the configuration of external influences that consists of institutional and stakeholder pressures. While institutions affect firms' social behavior by shaping the macro-level incentive structure and sources of legitimacy (distal mechanisms), firms' stakeholders can amplify or buffer the institutional forces by acting as mediators (proximate mechanisms). The two dimensions are interdependent in that stakeholders draw legitimacy and power from institutions, and institutions are often actualized through stakeholder mechanisms. Together, they form a particular configuration of external influences that shapes how focal firms construct their CSR strategy. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate social responsibility; corporate social strategy; institutional theory; stakeholder theory",,"Lee, M.-D.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint identified by years of experience dealing with co-operative organisations. Findings: The paper finds that the basis of development of corporate social responsibility from the perspective of commercial corporations does not promote an adequate accounting framework for co-operative enterprises and member-owned businesses. Research limitations/implications: Practitioners in different areas of business are trying to make sense of sustainability accounting and reporting in a commercial setting. This piece by one of these, draws on a topical initiative around co-operative enterprises to raise questions around what is meant by performance in the context of member-owned enterprises and whether the field of corporate social responsibility has overlooked the relevance of ownership in terms of organisational incentives for action. Practical implications: The author proposes a series of definitions for co-operative performance, which are designed to underpin metrics that relate to ""member value"". This is offered in contrast to ""shareholder value"" for companies that, unlike co-operatives, are owned by external shareholders. Social implications: The field of corporate social responsibility is a major user and innovator of the tools and techniques for sustainability accounting and reporting. But it tends to be silent on ownership. However, if different models of ownership create different incentives for action on sustainable development, then rather than just accounting for ""how"" an enterprise operates, however it is owned and led, there may be value in tools to test ""whether"" an institution is fit for purpose in its fundamental design.

An equilibrium in these three markets yields a three-equation structural model that relates corporate financial performance (CFP), corporate social performance (CSP), and social pressure. This paper estimates the simultaneous equation model for a panel of over 1,600 firms and finds that CFP is uncorrelated with CSP and negatively correlated with social pressure. CSP is decreasing in CFP and increasing in social pressure. Social pressure is increasing in CSP and decreasing in CFP, which is consistent with social pressure being directed to soft targets. Disaggregating the panel indicates that CFP is positively correlated with CSP for firms in consumer markets and negatively correlated for industrial markets. For consumer markets, CSP is increasing in CFP, which is consistent with a perquisites hypothesis that managers spend on CSR when they can afford it. For industrial markets CSP is decreasing in CFP, which is consistent with a moral management hypothesis. For both consumer and industrial markets, CSP is responsive to social pressure. © 2011 Berkeley Electronic Press.

Nevertheless, research into corporate social responsibility (CSR) among travel and tourism businesses is at a relatively early stage. This paper reports on external stakeholders' perceptions of CSR among low-fares airlines (LFAs) in peripheral regions of the UK in late 2008; that is, during the current global economic downturn. LFAs, their business plans and their ability to contribute towards sustainable development have been the source of much public discourse and media scrutiny in the last decade. This paper does not set out to reopen that debate per se. Rather, it contributes to a deeper understanding of CSR in the tourism sector by arguing for a more nuanced approach to external stakeholders, one which is also informed by primary empirical research from qualitative sources, and which is conceptually informed by the latest thinking from other sectors of economic activity. Important inter-regional variations exist in external stakeholders' perceptions and valorizations of CSR, they are context-specific, and they are not static as their responses to the recent downturn reveal. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Corporate social responsibility; Low-fares airlines; Recession; Tourism; Travel; UK","airline industry; corporate strategy; economic activity; economic instability; social work; stakeholder; sustainable development; tourism development; tourism economics; tourism market; travel behavior; United Kingdom","Coles, T.; Department of Management, University of Exeter Business School, Streatham Court, Rennes Drive, Exeter, Devon EX4 4PU, United Kingdom; email: t.e.coles@exeter.ac.uk",,,13683500,,,,"English","Curr.

Views vary from those who believe that CSR and CSI are distractions from profit maximisation to those who argue that participation in such activities contributes to positive social transformation and also benefits participating firms themselves.

Specifically, it examines how CSR, CSI and the socially responsible investment (SRI) index has been used to evaluate corporate behaviour in South Africa, as a novel way of addressing pressing development problems. Findings - CSI has emerged from the specificities of South African historical development, and it has arguably been driven primarily by legislation and industry charters. It is in this context that CSI, with its paraphernalia of the SRI Index and social capital market, promises to present a new and radical way of addressing developmental problems.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology employed in the study is to survey the main theoretical approaches for understanding and CG in relation to mature markets and EMs. Findings: The paper makes a small but important contribution to theory building by modifying and expanding the conceptual framework put forward by Weimer, Pape, Gedjlovic, and Shapiro to make a distinction between systems of corporate governance and particularly the ""taxonomy of systems of corporate governance"". This is achieved by identifying an additional set of key variables specifically relevant to EMs as a group of countries.

We suggest that an important determining factor involves organizational identity, which drives firm response to societal norms and facilitates its quest for legitimacy. Accordingly, this study contributes to organizational theory in marketing by casting identity as the focal mechanism in the firm's response to the institutional environment. Marketing ethics and CSR issues frame this research given natural synergies with institutional and organizational identity theories and evidence that increasingly, firms must respond to societal expectations involving ethics in their marketing practices.

Given a relative scarcity of research into CSR in Russia, particular attention is to be given to firms from that country. Design/methodology/approach: The research question is examined through an analysis of differences between firms from industrialized nations, transition economies, and newly industrialized countries in terms of the breadth and depth of their sustainability reporting. This three-way comparison analyses corporate sustainability reporting according to the GRI G3 framework developed by the Global Reporting Initiative. Findings: The firms in the sample display clear evidence of a divide between industrialized and emerging economies, with Russia occupying a middle position. Contrary to expectations, however, emerging economy firms outperform those from industrialized nations in their coverage of GRI indicators. Research limitations/implications: These findings leave open two possible conclusions: either emerging economy MNEs have leaped to the front in terms of addressing sustainability or they have been able to use GRI reporting as window-dressing to hide a dirtier reality. From a different angle, the strong evidence of a North-South divide in the sample also lends support to the national business systems approach to CSR. Originality/value: The paper adds to a small but growing body of cross-national studies into CSR that go beyond OECD member countries. In particular, it constitutes one of the first studies not only to tease out CSR priorities of large Russian firms but also to elucidate differences in terms of CSR priorities between newly industrialized countries and transition economies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability reporting; Emerging economies; Global Reporting Initiative; Industrialised economies; Russia; Social responsibility",,"Preuss, L.; School of Management, Egham, United Kingdom; email: Lutz.Preuss@rhul.ac.uk",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

The imperatives faced by companies seeking to secure their future competitiveness can be better appreciated through an understanding of the sustainability landscape, and this paper seeks to examine perspectives on environmental, social and governance issues from CEOs in the emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on extensive conversations with business leaders, both through the authors' work with leading multinational companies and their survey of over 800 global CEOs conducted in partnership with the United Nations Global Compact - the largest CEO study on sustainability to date. In the spirit of contributing to the debate on corporate sustainability, the paper presents the findings not as an academic submission, but rather as a reflective practitioner paper based on the authors' applied research. Their intention throughout is to faithfully report the views of the CEOs interviewed and surveyed, offering in places the beginnings of their own explanation of their results, and highlighting areas for future research and engagement by academics and educators. Findings: As one looks towards the next decade, and new waves of growth, it is clear that CEOs are beginning to recognize the scale of the challenge they face in aligning sustainability with core business. They also recognize, however, that this transition will depend on the economy's most powerful force, business - and that, with immediate and sustained action, individual companies can play a critical role in building the foundations of a more sustainable economy. From the wide-ranging set of interviews and survey responses, it seems that nowhere does this seem to be more keenly felt than in the emerging markets, and it is hoped that this is a timely and useful contribution to advancing the debate, with a unique insight into the views of CEOs and global leaders on what it will take to reach a new era of sustainability. Originality/value: This paper, based on extensive conversations with an unprecedented set of leading global CEOs, presents perspectives of leading CEOs in the emerging markets. By examining the forces shaping businesses' response to societal demands and the challenges of corporate sustainability, the authors set out some of the ways in which business is responding - and some of the capabilities that will be required to secure companies' competitiveness on the journey to a new era of sustainability. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Emerging markets; Environmental management; Governance; Social; Sustainability",,"Lacy, P.; Accenture Sustainability Services, London, United Kingdom; email: peter.lacy@accenture.com",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

Yet, consumers, overwhelmed by these more or less well-founded CSR claims, often have trouble identifying truly responsible firms. This confusion encourages 'greenwashing' and may make CSR initiatives less effective. On the basis of attribution theory, this study investigates the role of independent sustainability ratings on consumers' responses to companies' CSR communication. Experimental results indicate the negative effect of a poor sustainability rating for corporate brand evaluations in the case of CSR communication, because consumers infer less intrinsic motives by the brand.

Increased awareness heightens focus on stakeholder relations and dialogue as key aspects in corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate identity and corporate communication scholarship, but the question remains how can dialogue be initiated and maintained? The purpose of this paper is to establish a framework for conceptualizing dialogue. Design/methodology/approach: Through a review of CSR, corporate identity, corporate communication and stakeholder literature, a framework is developed taking into account the different stakes held by key stakeholder groups, i.e. consumers, investors, employees, non-governmental organization and suppliers. Based on the discursive terms of form and script, we argue that different stakes condition different dialogical types. Findings: The paper argues that the stakeholder orientations of the CSR, corporate identity and corporate communication disciplines can aid in strengthening dialogue. It is thus suggested that dialogue may be strengthened by constructing a framework which links the stakes held by key stakeholder groups to specific dialogue forms and scripts. Practical implications: The practical implication of articulating stakeholder dialogue as scripted interaction is that organizations seeking to engage stakeholders strategically must understand and respect conventions and expectations.

Cause-Related Marketing (CRM) has evolved as an area of social responsibility that allows firms to link their philanthropic activities with the strategic marketing goals of the firm. Specifically, CRM occurs when a firm makes an offer to contribute a portion of the proceeds of a consumer purchase of the firm's products or services to a charitable cause. Academic research into CRM has covered a broad landscape. Studies include: potential benefits to the brand; consumer behavior surrounding CRM offers; brand/cause alliances, and; potential benefits to the cause. Additionally, numerous theories have been used to explain various CRM activities. However, each theory that has been presented has been aimed towards explaining specific phenomena, and an all-encompassing theory to explain the antecedents and consequences of successful CRM partnerships has been elusive. The purpose of this study is to use associative learning theory as a framework for understanding the antecedents and consequences of successful CRM partnerships for both brand and firm. Associative learning theory develops principles such as, belongingness and reputation that set the foundation for incorporating partnership compatibility and long-term brand/cause relationships as antecedents that should link the relationship to benefits for both brand and firm. These benefits, increased word-of-mouth, improved image for the firm, consumer attitudes towards the brand, and greater purchase likelihood, thus form the desired consequences completing the framework. The significance of this research is that it introduces one theory to explain what attributes of a CRM partnership lead to the best outcomes. Additionally, this study introduces word-of-mouth promotion as a desired outcome of CRM. This study was conducted by asking respondents to read one of 4 scenarios (2×2 factorial design) and then answer a series of questions. Data was collected by an online firm to ensuregreater generalizability, and was subjected to AMOS 6 for analysis. Hypotheses were then tested using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. The results indicate that the overall model of antecedents and consequences of CRM relationships has excellent fit, and both antecedents, relationship compatibility and longevity of relationship, are indicators of the strength of the brand/cause relationship. Additionally, increased positive Word-of-mouth and improved brand image are fully supported as consequences of a strong brand/cause relationship. Finally, improved firm image and increased purchase likelihood are partially supported as consequences.",,,"Thomas, M.L.; Georgia Southern UniversityUnited States",,,10956298,,,,"English","Acad.

Design/methodology/approach: Three themes are explored within the context of the BRICs: geopolitics and global governance in the twenty-first century; the balance between public good and private enterprise; and frameworks for equitable trade and inclusive growth. Findings: The global situation is precarious, characterized by multi-polarity, asymmetrical power threats, and a vacuum in global governance. The trade-based economic development of the BRICs is a positive economic sign but raises implications for sustainability. There is a need for balance between the ability of the public sector to provide public goods, including global public goods, and the need for government to create incentives for the private sector and unleash its creativity and energy. With the proper incentives and legal structure, including respect for the rule of law, the energy and creativity of the private sector can be harnessed to develop a framework for equitable trade and inclusive growth, and to further the development of a sustainable global market economy. Originality/value: The paper provides a catalyst for discussion that bridges the gap between business school education, legal education, political science and economics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economics; Education; Governance; Inclusive growth; Rule of law; Sustainability; Trade",,"Appleton, A.

It has been argued that scientific uncertainties surrounding nanotechnologies and the inability of regulatory agencies to keep up with industry developments mean that voluntary regulation will play a part in the development of nanotechnologies. The development of technological applications based on nanoscale science is now increasingly seen as a potential test case for new models of regulation based on future-oriented responsibility, lifecycle risk management, and upstream public engagement. This article outlines findings from a project undertaken in 2008-2009 for the UK Government's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) by BRASS at Cardiff University, involving an in-depth survey both of current corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting in the UK nanotechnologies industry, and of attitudes to particular stakeholder issues within the industry. The article analyses the results to give an account of the nature of corporate social performance (CSP) within the industry, together with the particular model of CSR operating therein ('do no harm' versus 'positive social force'). It is argued that the nature of emerging technologies requires businesses to adopt particular visions of CSR in order to address stakeholder issues, and that the nanotechnologies industry presents specific obstacles and opportunities in this regard. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","CSP; CSR; innovation; nanotechnology; risk; stakeholder engagement; uncertainty",,"Groves, C.; ESRC Centre for Business Relationships, Accountability, Sustainability and Society (BRASS), 55 Park Place, Cardiff CF10 3AT, United Kingdom; email: grovesc1@cf.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Although there is no single accepted definition of CSR, it remains an inspiring, challenging and strategic development that is becoming an increasingly important priority for companies of all sizes and types, particularly in Europe. Promotion of well-being at work is an essential component of CSR; however, the link between CSR, working conditions and work organisation is still found to be unfamiliar to stakeholders. As CSR is strategic and is regarded by many companies and corporate leaders as an important development, it offers opportunities for psychosocial risk management, an area that is currently among the top priorities in working environment and well-being at work debates. However, the link between CSR and psychosocial risk management has not been addressed clearly before. This paper aims to explore the potential role of CSR in promoting well-being at work through the development of a framework for the management of psychosocial risks. As part of the research, key stakeholders [including the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), the European Commission (EC), employers' associations, trade unions and other policy experts] across Europe participated in a survey, interviews and focus groups to assess and clarify the link between CSR and psychosocial risk management. On the basis of the findings, a CSR-inspired approach to the management of psychosocial issues at work is proposed.

In this paper, we aim to address this gap by critically engaging with marketing campaigns of so-called 'ethical' bottled water. We especially focus on a major CSR strategy of a range of different companies that promise to provide drinking water for (what they name as) 'poor African people' by way of Western consumers purchasing bottled water. Following Fairclough's approach, we unfold a three-step critical discourse analysis of the marketing campaigns of 10 such 'ethical' brands. Our results show that bottled water companies try to influence consumers' tastes through the management of the cultural meaning of bottled water, producing a more 'ethical' and 'socially responsible' perception of their products/ brands. Theoretically, we base our analysis on McCracken's model of the cultural meaning of consumer goods, which, we argue, offers a critical perspective of the recent emergence of CSR and business ethics initiatives. We discuss how these marketing campaigns can be framed as historical struggles associated with neo-liberal ideology and hegemony. Our analysis demonstrates how such CSR strategies are part of a general process of the reproduction of capitalist modes of accumulation and legitimation through the usage of cultural categories. © 2011 The Author.",,,"Brei, V.; Management Science Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC)Brazil",,,09628770,,,,"English","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents Martin's view, - that modern capitalism has come through two major eras over the last century, managerial capitalism (1930s to 1970s) and shareholder capitalism (1980s to 2000s). He argues that the time has come to embark on a new era, the era of ""customer capitalism"" and explains why. Findings: In answer to another set of questions, Martin provides his own insight into one of the management field's most elusive and intriguing questions: what is the essence of outstanding leadership, particularly at the CEO level? His research has led him to the finding that exceptional leaders are distinguished most by the way they think, by their capacity for what he calls ""integrative thinking."" Practical implications: To a third set of questions, Martin offers his own solution to one of the major challenges facing senior executives today, how to become more innovative, not only in products and process, but also in the area of business management itself. His answer - executives should look to the concept of ""design thinking"" and learn how to apply it more widely to processes like strategy development and business model innovation. Originality/value: Roger Martin believes that the shareholder value system has been rigged to the detriment of stockholders, that great managers are distinguished by how they think before they decide what to do and that design thinking is a key competitive competency. Martin offers groundbreaking ways to think about leading and management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Abductive logic; Business model innovation; Corporate social responsibility; Customer capitalism; Customer satisfaction; Design thinking; Executive decision making; Expectations market; Integrative thinking; Personal knowledge system; Shareholder value maximization; Strategy development",,"Leavy, B.email: brian.leavy@dcu.ie",,,10878572,,,,"English","Strategy Leadersh.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959824617

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is primarily theoretical in perspective. It also draws upon interview data derived from an in depth study of a large state-owned corporate group in China in order to demonstrate the model that is known as modern Confucian entrepreneurship. Findings: Adherence to Confucian values was demonstrated by both manager and employee interviewees. However, Chinese managers also need to reform some practices as they move into the international market place. As western managers, at the same time, increasingly seek to increase their social capital it is clear that Chinese and western managers can learn from each other. Research limitations/implications: The examples drawn upon in this paper come from a state-owned corporation. Indications are that smaller, privately owned companies in China are more aggressively adopting market models built upon competitive individualism. Further research is needed to develop comparisons. Practical implications: The paper suggests a hybrid model of business management that combines aspects of both western and Confucian-based management styles that are proven to be successful in building social capital. It also suggests that fundamental change needs to be effected through business school teaching. Social implications: The paper urges a more collective view of management that is built upon trust and focuses on employee and social wellbeing. Indications are that increased wellbeing generates more cohesive, productive and happier societies. Originality/value: The introduction of interview data provides unique insight to Confucian values in practice in a modern Chinese company. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Confucianism; Corporate social responsibility; Employee wellbeing; Managers; Modern Confucian entrepreneurship; Social capital",,"Roper, J.; Department of Management Communication, Waikato Management School, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; email: jroper@waikato.ac.nz",,,02621711,,,,"English","J.

It is based on a field study of the events following the announcement of collective redundancies at a Swedish high-tech company. Although more than 10,000 workers were dismissed, the company was accepted as being socially responsible. The study reveals that this outcome was the result of a process whereby corporate representatives managed to enrol and mobilize a network of actors into being faithful to, and defending, their definition of social responsibility. This indicates that a company can assume an active role in the construction of the same network of actors that it is asked to respond to and impose upon other actors its own definition of what it means to be socially responsible.

For studies of tourism, the paper points to the need for greater theoretical and conceptual urgency in research on corporate social responsibility and corporate philanthropy if future practical action at the destination level is to match current advocacy. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cause-related marketing; Corporate philanthropy; Corporate social responsibility; Low-fares airlines; Tourism and transport","airline industry; analytical framework; governance approach; marketing; stakeholder; sustainable development; tourism market; tourist destination","Fenclova, E.; Centre for Sport, Leisure and Tourism Research University of Exeter Business School Streatham Court, Rennes Drive Exeter, United Kingdom; email: e.fenclova@exeter.ac.uk",,,10992340,,,,"English","Int.

Using the lenses of pro-social behaviour and corporate social responsibility, the purpose of this research is twofold. First, we provide an empirical analysis to profile athletes with charitable foundations, finding a connection between firms and athletes engaging in charitable behaviours. Second, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding professional athletes' connection to participate in socially responsible behaviour including the potential impact of their work on the firms they represent.

Private lenders and their employees (loan originators) are often the key point of contact to connect low-income borrowers to public programs. But why would loan originators offer borrowers public loan programs, particularly when such programs provide no additional (and sometimes reduced) direct financial compensation to the private lenders and potentially increased workloads? One possible rationale, and the one investigated here, is that loan originators may be diversely motivated toward the advancement of the public interest. Situating the analysis within the theoretical insights of public service motivation in the public sector and corporate social responsibility in the private sector, we propose and test a ""Model of Public Service in the Private Sector."" We draw from surveys of private lenders to test hypotheses about how private lenders' associations, perceptions, and values are related to voluntary participation in a government program. Our analysis highlights the importance of public associations, perceptions of government, and public values in explaining the behavior of private sector employees. Our findings contribute to the literature on public service and public values and our understanding of how private organizations access government programs to advance the public good. © The Author 2010.

The 19th century concept of the corporation still underpins corporate governance practice today: If the company was re-invented to meet contemporary circumstances, what might it look like today? Research Findings/Insights: The original corporate concept was superbly simple and brilliantly successful. Subsequently, the growing diversity of corporate objectives, confused ownership structures, and complex corporate groups, has led to abuse. Society has lost the control which it originally demanded for the right to incorporate companies in which shareholders' had no liability for corporate debts beyond their equity stake. Faced with government bail-outs of failing companies, allegedly excessive executive remuneration, and a growing concern for corporate social responsibility and sustainability, the time has come to re-think the rationale, the purpose, and the governance of the joint-stock, limited-liability company. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper has been written in response to the editor's initiative to seek contributions that might provide alternative theoretical insights into corporate governance issues. By taking a historical, evolutionary perspective, this paper looks at corporate governance through a different lens than those of agency theory, stewardship theory, or the growing philosophical interest in corporate social responsibility. The primary theoretical call is for a taxonomy of corporate entities that differentiates them according to the way that power is exercised over them. The paper also highlights three unresolved paradoxes in corporate governance orthodoxy - governance by principles or rules, independent directors' ignorance of the business, and the unitary board's dual responsibility for both performance and conformance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The paper offers an alternative paradigm for the governance of corporate entities introducing the concepts of the governing body, executive management, and the sakeholder liaison groups. It is also suggested that external auditors should report to regulators, not directors. The underlying argument is that limited liability is a privilege granted by society, not a right. What society grants, society can take away if it is not satisfied with the way companies are managed or governed. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Auditors' responsibilities; Corporate governance; Corporate taxonomy; Limited-liability; Stakeholder liaison groups",,"Tricker, B.The Hill House, 23 St. Peters Hill, Brixham TQ5 9TE, Hong Kong; email: bobtricker@aol.com",,,09648410,,,,"English","Corp.

Moreover, the association between stakeholder management and management control system use is analyzed. In the wake of the economic crisis of 2008/2009, many firms were faced with severe threats that called for immediate short-term action to ensure firm survival. However, short-term action like massive cost-cutting and cash generation often are blamed for going at the expense of long-term health as key stakeholder relations may be irreversibly harmed. Hence, three interrelated questions are addressed theoretically and empirically: First, we analyze the impact of the recent economic crisis on firms' control strategies. More specifically, we investigate whether a high crisis impact on firms is associated with a shortening of reporting cycles, a more interactive use of control-relevant information, restriction of employee autonomy and a focus on liquidity and cost-cutting. Second, we examine from the viewpoint of stakeholder theory how firms can make use of active stakeholder management for crisis management. Third, we explore whether firms can take short-term measures for ensuring liquidity and cutting costs and at the same time pursue a stakeholder strategy aiming at the long-term survival of the firm. Using survey data from 204 major Austrian corporations, we provide evidence that firms significantly adjusted their control systems as a response to the economic crisis. Our data do not indicate an immanent contradiction between a ""short-term finance focus"" and the pursuit of a sustainable stakeholder strategy. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Crisis; Management accounting; Management control; Stakeholder management",,"Asel, J.

We investigated the stakeholder interaction effects on performance of domestic firms competing in an emerging market (Wright, Filatotchev, Hoskisson, & Peng, 2005) from a contractual perspective (Williamson, 1985). We argue that interacting stakeholders in a contractual set yield synergistic governance structures that allow firms more efficient access to external resources. Using a sample of 267 firms in Brazil (secondary data), we explored different patterns in stakeholder contracting with community, government, top management, and employees. A three-stage analysis process was devised: cluster analysis, general linear model estimation and verification tests. Results suggest that stakeholder interaction has a positive impact on firm performance.

Newly emerging forms of global governance are now relying on private actors (business, non governmental organizations (NGOs)) rather than states. Therefore, CSR policy and programmes are necessary steps in securing responsible corporate behaviour in support of development. The objectives of this paper are to identify the areas of interventions for CSR activities and examine the rationale behind the CSR activities in Mauritius. It aims to analyse the relation between business and poverty reduction and also the successes and failures of CSR initiatives and how the programmes are delivering to the company's business objectives. In short, how is CSR redefining development? Design/methodology/approach: Both primary and secondary data have been collected for this study. Qualitative methods of data collection were privileged to address complex issues such as the relationship between CSR and development. In-depth interviews were carried out and seen as an appropriate research technique in order to explore and capture the perspectives of the stakeholders, namely private sector and the NGOs on CSR. Secondary sources in the form of company publications, annual reports, press cuttings, web sites of companies and survey reports were consulted. Findings: Although CSR initiatives go quite a long way back in Mauritius, it is still believed that CSR is not embedded in its corporate culture. However, in some cases, CSR is merely being used as window-dressing, for the gallery as a sideshow since it is a trendy issue and that everyone is doing it alongside with the wide media coverage. For CSR to become the national development tool, it is important that coordinated and concerted efforts be undertaken at the private sector level, in the civil society and at government level in achieving equitable, inclusive and sustainable development. Originality/value: This work contributes to the scarce literature on CSR in Mauritius as well as in the African continent, investigating the relationship between CSR and development in the Mauritian context. It also provides an extensive and critical literature review on CSR and CSR activities in Mauritius. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Mauritius; Non-governmental organizations; Poverty; Private sector organizations; Research and development",,"Gokulsing, R.

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis is deployed to determine CSR disclosure. A disclosure index consisting of 16 items was developed based on four general themes: human resource, marketplace, community and environment to assess the disclosure level. The relationship between company characteristics and total disclosure was examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Findings: The major finding of this study is that the theme of disclosure has shifted from human resource to marketplace. This is followed by human resource, community and, finally, environment. Ironically, companies are not only disclosing good news, but also bad/negative news. This study provides further evidence that is, to a certain extent, some GLCs have influenced other companies' practices to disclose CSR information.

It used a qualitative approach, i.e. a case study. Primary and secondary data are in the form of information about CSR programs conducted by the four companies from sustainable reports downloaded from each respective company's web site, mass media news downloaded from the internet, and other literature studies. Findings The case study shows high commitment from the four companies to the execution of CSR programs and business ethics. They also attempt to carry out programs involving the triple bottom line. Also, this case study found that two consumer goods companies (Unilever Indonesia and Sari Husada) and one manufacturing company (Astra International) conduct CSR programs that are both related and unrelated to their core businesses while a mining company (Aneka Tambang) tends to conduct CSR programs that are unrelated to its core business.

In total, 117 companies in ""three sensitive industries"" for the year 2007 were selected. CSR reputation is analyzed based on a self-constructed index. Findings Based on regression analysis, the study found that regulatory efforts are significant mechanisms in promoting CSR reputation. Surprisingly, these companies in the ""sensitive industry"" seem to neglect the importance of environmental reputation. However, institutional owners regard CSR reporting as a means to enhance their CSR reputation, while family-owned companies do not appear to consider CSR reporting as an important channel to boost their reputation.

Design/methodology/approach The method used is qualitative research with a case study approach. The empirical data are based on the fieldwork in the states of Esprito Santo and Bahia. The aim was to scrutinize the corporate tactics in gaining societal legitimacy, both in Brazil and in Finland; these were categorized into thematic groups. Findings The legitimacy of the Finnish companies becomes questionable due to the unethical tactics of their Brazilian business partner, Aracruz Celulose SA. When the company takes its ""marginal"" stakeholders' demands seriously and commits itself to them in diverse ways (economically, ecologically etc.), corporate social responsibility becomes a reality. The search for legitimacy also requires the company to change its corporate knowledge production systems, and also requires a willingness on the part of the company to encounter different types of knowledge that are locally attached. Originality/value The study offers new information about the relationship between multinational corporations and local communities in Brazil especially from the perspective of indigenous communities. The paper also contributes to legitimation research.

Its purpose is to evaluate critically the genuineness of the early stages in acquiring CSR practices, and to advance the notion of authenticity in its mature development stage. The analyses seek to show an imbalance between the so-called feminine and masculine principles in the professional business arena, which prevents an authentic CSR business approach taking place. Design/methodology/approach The authors approach the topic from various concepts and criteria of moral correctness regarding CSR, and crucial change points in the transient process from insincere to authentic CSR. Findings The paper identifies some elements of insincere CSR in every company in its early stages of acquiring CSR practices, especially in the early stages of the development of the business culture, and also during the maturing process. Research limitations/implications The paper demonstrates the excessive significance of the rapid development of CSR sensibility in society and in the business community because, in such situations, knowledge of all affected parties prevents business subjects from misdirection and forces them to choose between lying and telling the truth. Practical implications The paper demonstrates a business-based rationale for the adoption of mature, non-deceptive CSR practices, since the overall situation in the business community and in society becomes clearer regarding criteria.

This approach aims to enable the paper to focus on the relations between three publicly listed corporations in Australia and the recipients of a selection of their CSR programs. Design/methodology/approach Informed by ethnographic principles, hypertext ethnography provided the research protocols and analytical frame that were used to deconstruct the meanings in web texts that represented the connections between the corporations and their CSR stakeholders. Findings The corporations and the stakeholders articulated their perspectives on CSR in affirmative ways, apparently to maintain their positive benefactor-recipient relations. While these discourses held the potential to mask more complex tensions in their relationships, the web was found to provide a rich hypertextual story that had a vastly broader scope than the self-contained corporate and stakeholder agendas. Research limitations/implications The research approach presented here provides a useful first approximation to the study of CSR, through self representations, and offers a rigorous critical understanding of the practice of CSR. The approach can achieve much with only limited resources, but it could be developed through on-site ethnographic research. Practical implications Because image-conscious corporations are often reluctant to participate in CSR research, the unobtrusive approach of hypertext ethnography can provide access to important data for the researcher. This is especially significant in the case of critical research, and when the characteristics of the CSR contributions or stakeholder relations are to be investigated. Originality/value This paper offers a new way for approaching the study of CSR, by taking advantage of rich sources of data that are publicly available. Treating the web texts as primary data and critically analysing them following rigorous research protocols, enable new opportunities for understanding the public representations of CSR. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a questionnaire sent to the CFOs of 88 of New Zealand's largest listed companies; the CFOs were telephoned beforehand and introduced to the nature of the research and asked if they would participate. A total of 33 fully completed responses were returned. Findings - CFOs expressed their agreement with the adoption of sustainable development as they believed there were benefits to be made for their firms; the survey identified reputation enhancement and good corporate governance as the two main benefits. However they were reluctant to have their firms' information scrutinised by stakeholders. They believed that stakeholders are largely unaware of the difficulties of adopting sustainable development practices, and furthermore, stakeholders have unrealistic expectations of what their firms could achieve by adopting sustainable development. CFOs did not believe that sustainable development would cut costs and improve their profits - rather they believed that sustainable development adoption was very inconvenient as it is costly. Thus the influence for firms to adopt sustainable development practices is driven largely by non-financial factors rather than any economic gains. This corroborates earlier findings. Research limitations/implications - The research utilises primary data collected in 2008. A useable response rate of 38 per cent was achieved. The research is restricted to New Zealand listed companies. Practical implications - In gaining a deeper appreciation of where CFOs gain their understanding of sustainable development issues, and how they participate in the discourse around sustainable development, we are potentially better able to provide information to this key group of people. Originality/value - Very little research has been undertaken into how CFOs gain their knowledge about sustainability reporting nor about their views on the subject.

Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts a case study approach to investigate a business that operates successfully in this challenging market. Findings As a consequence of increasing demand for ethical clothing, it has become standard practice for UK clothing retailers to develop CSR policies which impact upon their methods of garment sourcing and partnerships with suppliers. There is also a significant trend for retailers to offer ethical clothing ranges made from organic cotton or produced by Fair Trade manufacturers. The paper includes a case study on People Tree, which sells Fair Trade clothing sourced from developing countries. People Tree is rare amongst clothing companies in that it provides customers with a transparent view of its production sources via the internet. The company provides an example of how socially responsible and environmentally sustainable global sourcing can be applied in practice. Research limitations/implications The study focuses on aspects of sustainability in an individual retailer. This could be extended to other ethical retailers in different countries, and a longitudinal study of such companies could be conducted.

This study posits that CSR is mainly influenced by: accountability, responsibility, transparency, and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - A path analysis is employed to determine the relationships, while confirmatory factor analysis is applied to assess the construct validity of the model. The data presented in this study were collected from Taiwanese companies in the year 2009 using questionnaires. A total of 170 companies were analyzed. Findings - The results show that both accountability and transparency provide statistically significant contributions to the prediction of competitiveness, which in turn has a significant effect on responsibility. Research limitations/implications - First, the paper encompasses four core factors influencing the measurement of CSR. Second, the sample size used to analyze the diversity of concepts may appear small and therefore the result may not be considered precise since the total number of companies in Taiwan is over one million. Large sample size may lead to different results and therefore needs to be further explored. Third, while the proposed model was only tested in Taiwan, a country with 97.8 percent SMEs, the outcome of the research may only be applicable to Taiwan rather than to other countries with different national systems of business-society relations. Finally, this study only investigated the relationships among core components of CSR. Practical implications - While developing business strategies, companies taking accountability and transparency as priority will strengthen their competitiveness and in turn generate responsibility and lead to CSR, a way to reach corporate sustainability. Social implications - The results provide business leaders with practical advice that implementing CSR is not only the smart and right thing to do from a business perspective, but also the right thing to do from a society perspective. Originality/value - Applying for international standards could be a feasible and optimal way to show commitments to CSR implementation. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This concept is illustrated through a case study. Design/methodology/approach: The understanding of humanism applied is one drawn from Catholic social teaching. The case has been developed from the personal experience of one of the authors (Mammoser), enriched with interviews and reports, along with some public information, which helps to understand the socio-cultural context. Findings: HCCI is defined by four characteristics: recognizing and respecting human dignity and rights, fostering integral human development, acting virtuously; this means that the social actions included in CCI have the direct motive of doing good, and organizing social actions in accordance with both the Principle of Solidarity and the Principle of Subsidiarity. The specification of these characteristics can vary from one situation to another. Here we discuss a real case in which these characteristics underlie a successful project in the USA, jointly developed by the US company Walgreens and the Midtown Educational Foundation, a Chicago-based NGO. Research limitations/implications: The case study does not seek to suggest that this is the only way for CCI with a humanistic approach, but to shed light on and motivate other similar initiatives. Practical implications: Findings provide new horizons to undertake CCI and a project, which could be included within the best practices in this field. Originality/value: The paper provides a new approach to CCI based on a humanistic perspective, which enriches other approaches. In doing so, it does not consider such involvement as a means for public relations, reputation enhancement, and ultimately profits. It goes beyond a generic contribution to public good, or of a fair return to society for what a company has received from it.

Design/methodology/approach: A model for the ""strategization"" of ethics and CSR - i.e. their integration into a firm's strategies - is put forward in this paper. In addition, this model is evaluated through a case study of a Spanish innovative company, Indra. Data were generated based on interviews with various managers involved in the development of CSR, KM and corporate strategies. Findings: The paper provides evidence of the efforts this company is making in order to connect CSR initiatives with competitive advantage through the development of intangible assets such as human capital and innovation capacity, for which KM is an essential tool. Research limitations/implications: The case study is limited to one company in order to go deeper into the ""strategization"" of CSR process. Future studies will focus on a larger and more diverse sample of firms. Practical implications: Important factors of influence, which have been observed in this process, have been extracted from the case study, such as the necessity of promoting the company's ethical principles through its corporate culture, the human resources practices which encourage the access to and the transfer of knowledge, and relationships with its stakeholders that allow the creation of knowledge, innovation and human development.

This model can provide a roadmap for managers in other firms in order to formulate and implement a CSR plan in accordance with the company's strategies and mission. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Corporate strategy; Ethics; Knowledge management; Spain",,"Guadamillas-Gómez, F.; University of Castilla-La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; email: fatima.guadamillas@uclm.es",,,02621711,,,,"English","J.

Existing theories, addressing the corporate level of analysis, focus on forces exogenous to the firm: local resource pressures, and institutional norms. Using a combination of induction and fuzzy-set analysis, I draw on documentary evidence and 298 interviews with managers and stakeholders to build theory about the conditions that shape subsidiaries' stakeholder orientations. Two major findings emerge. First, although theory emphasizes external stakeholders' control over resources, internal control through the corporate parent can crowd out the voices of local stakeholders. Second, although institutional theory proposes isomorphism with local norms and standards, some corporations are subject to scrutiny by global stakeholders, and their subsidiaries face higher requirements for social engagement than their peers. These findings are the foundation of a mid-range theory that combines conventional explanations, focused on environmental factors, and an internal-stakeholder perspective, based around the roles of the parent corporation as owner and resource provider, to predict stakeholder orientation. © 2011 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.","corporate social responsibility; fuzzy set methods; global stakeholders",,"Crilly, D.; London Business School, Regent's Park, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom; email: dcrilly@london.edu",,,00472506,,,,"English","J.

Utilizing case study data drawn from a study of a large multinational energy company, we explore how management relies on employees' interaction with CSR as the process of initiation → implementation → maturation develops. Employee involvement grows from a minor element in the CSR initiation stage to a vital contributory factor in CSR's success in the later stages of the process. The article offers new insights into a processual and interactional approach to CSR that accounts for the actions of different actors involved at each stage.

We analyse, using generalized ordered logistic regression, the questionnaire responses of 2464 SRIs from 20 countries. The results demonstrate that younger and female SRIs are more likely to believe that a company's social and environmental performance is as important as its financial performance. Female SRIs and those with high incomes are the most likely to believe that companies should be as responsible to their shareholders as to the broader society. In addition, younger SRIs, those with high incomes and those who have attained higher education levels regard socially responsible companies as at least as profitable as other companies. The benefits which companies can derive from understanding the demographic profile of SRIs are examined, including a potentially lower cost of capital, improved CSR rankings and business policy formulation and communication consistent with CSR views held by specific groups of SRIs. © 2011 The Author(s).

We argue that this shareholder-stakeholder debate is an important issue within the overall corporate governance and corporate policy domain and examine one such stakeholder group - employees - by studying labor-friendly corporate practices. We find that announcements of labor-friendly policies are associated with positive abnormal stock returns. Labor-friendly firms also outperform otherwise similar firms, both in terms of long-run stock market returns and operating results. In addition, we find that the probability and benefits of labor-friendliness increase with the demand for highly skilled labor. Our analysis of excess executive compensation suggests that top management derives no pecuniary benefits from labor-friendly practices. We interpret our results as consistent with a genuine concern for employees translating into higher productivity and profitability, which in turn facilitate value creation. It appears that the benefits of labor-friendly practices significantly outweigh the costs and that what is good for employees is good for shareholders. © Springer 2010.","agency theory; corporate social responsibility; employee stakeholders; stakeholder theory",,"Trahan, E.

The study method is descriptive and uses independent sample t tests to identify significant differences over time and between countries. The major findings are fourfold. First, some topics' coverage and/or scandals exist in most of the sample's books based on their indexes. However, the page coverage for these topics/scandals is not overwhelming when compared to the number of pages in these texts. Second, the scandals/troubled corporations' page coverage increased between the earliest and the later editions as did a depth of coverage trend measure. Third, U. S. texts in the sample contained significantly more pages devoted to these topics and scandals than the non-adapted Canadian sample texts. Finally, and as expected, the sampled auditing texts contain significantly more pages devoted to these topics and scandals compared to the other financial accounting texts in the sample. Educators and textbook authors interested in the future of business and accounting education will find this study of interest.

Nevertheless, against the background of the corporate social responsibility discussion, providing human capital information is becoming increasingly important as a key driver of corporate reputation. Human capital reporting (HCR) can also be regarded as an instrument that may affect company financial performance and ultimately increase shareholder value. Against this background, we develop a theoretical model that illustrates the transformation of the intangible factors of HCR into tangible outcomes. Consequently, the model considers the various cause-and-effect relationships between HCR and company financial performance. As with a strategy map, three dimensions with a specific number of different intangible factors should be taken into consideration.

Design/methodology/approach: An online study with a convenient sampling consisting of college students is used to manipulate the visual communication of a pharmaceutical company's advertising disclosure for the purpose of examining the effects of visually primed advertising disclosure on attitude toward the disclosure, perceived CSR practices, and attitude toward the pharmaceutical company. Findings: The results reveal that a visually primed disclosure affects consumers' attitudes toward the disclosure positively. Visual priming also enhances consumers' perceived CSR practices and attitudes toward the company. This is evident as the impact of attitude toward the disclosure on attitude toward the company is mediated by perceived CSR practices. Practical implications: Pharmaceutical companies should improve their advertising disclosure practices by enhancing visual communications of their advertising disclosures. Since a mediating relationship between attitude toward the disclosure and attitude toward the pharmaceutical company is materialized by perceived CSR practices, visually primed advertising disclosures perceived as socially responsible practices can facilitate advertising effectiveness and enhance consumers' attitudes toward the pharmaceutical company. Originality/value: This paper adds value to the existing literature on pharmaceutical marketing and CSR practices, and promotes the effective management of advertising disclosures by reinforcing their communications through visual priming. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertising effectiveness; Consumer behaviour; CSR practices; Disclosure; Pharmaceutical advertising; Pharmaceuticals industry",,"Wang, A.; University of Connecticut-Stamford, Stamford, CT, United States; email: alex.wang@Uconn.edu",,,17506123,,,,"English","Int.

The inequitable distributions of risks, impacts, and benefits are key drivers of resource conflicts and are likely to remain at the forefront of mining-related research and advocacy. Procedural and interactional forms of justice therefore lie at the very heart of some of the real and ongoing challenges in mining, including: intractable local-level conflict; emerging global norms and performance standards; and ever-increasing expectations for the industry to translate high-level corporate social responsibility policy into on-the-ground practice. This research focuses on the ""process"" aspects of resource conflicts through an examination of existing grievance-handling procedures at six mining operations where company-community conflict was present. In their current form, and on their own, the six mechanisms were found to be insufficient in their capacity to advance justice.

An ambitious report from the United Nations Environment Programme's Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), commonly referred to as the 'Freshfields report', has recently given rise to considerable optimism on this issue among proponents of SRI. The present article puts the arguments of the Freshfields report into some further both empirical and critical perspective, however, and suggests that its findings do not call for very much optimism. The general argument is that while the understanding of fiduciary duty outlined by the Freshfields report seems to allow institutional investors to at least sometimes take some social or environmental considerations into account, the support it gives for SRI is notably contingent and, furthermore, it rules out exactly the kind of SRI which proponents of social responsibility and environmental sustainability should hold in highest regard - proactive cases and socially effective investment strategies. If SRI is to become an important force for corporate social responsibility through its adoption by institutional investors, then, it is suggested that legal reform is needed. © 2010 Springer.","ethical investment; fiduciary duty; Fresh-fields report; institutional investors; legal reform; prudent investor rule; social effectiveness; socially responsible investment; United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative",,"Sandberg, J.; Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science, University of Gothenburg, P.O.

To achieve this, we have conducted an empirical study to investigate sustainable business practices in small, medium and large organisations. With a sample of 80 different Australia-based firms, we have examined various parameters attributing to corporate sustainability and have arrived at three kinds of performance outcomes (factors) that concur with triple bottom line principles, which we term as: 1 corporate environmental performance outcome (CEPO) 2 corporate social performance outcome (CSPO) 3 corporate financial performance outcome (CFPO). The results of the ANOVA analysis of these factors against business size have been discussed and the significantly higher CEPO in large size businesses than in small or medium size businesses have been explored.

Second, we highlight the measurement level of the underlying data screens as an important determinant of the actual effects of CSP on CFP.

These questions were included in a questionnaire sent out annually to the 2,500 largest companies by market cap within the Dow Jones Global Index by an independent Swiss-based asset management firm.

While the current business curriculum typically educates students in the key business disciplines, many business schools deliver their curriculum by creating courses based on functional area, rather than the integration of knowledge from a holistic perspective. Therefore, the purpose of this literature review is to explore several approaches for delivering the business curriculum Design/methodology/approach: This aim is achieved through a holistic approach, which highlights the benefits and limitations of each proposal. Key approaches include capstone projects, service learning projects, team teaching, and integrative case studies. Findings: The literature review revealed that all four approaches provide students with the opportunity to integrate their business knowledge with the critical skills that they have mastered in their liberal arts courses. However, of these approaches, the research suggests that implementing a service learning program not only permits students to integrate their knowledge, but also provides the opportunity for real-life application of these concepts. In addition, this approach also provides the opportunity for students to experience social responsibility through civic engagement, hopefully strengthening their sense of ethics and character. Originality/value: The role of modern business is not only to maintain profits for its shareholders, but also to demonstrate good corporate citizenship. Thus, today's business educators have the responsibility to prepare students for the role of modern business, including corporate citizenship, sustainability, and social responsibility. Thus, this paper will allow business educators to explore ways to achieve this goal. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business development; Business studies; Curriculum development; Education; Teaching",,"Englehart, S.

The approach to the topic is based on reflection of the experiences of the author and colleagues, tied in with theories developed by the research of individuals in the field of leadership and organisational strategy. The result is a framework to provide guidance to practitioners working in organisations and a new approach for researchers in organisational management and stakeholder engagement. Findings: While there are many journals and books devoted to assisting management to lead and motivate staff and team members, there is an absence of research and thinking on how staff and team members may gain the attention and support of their managers. This paper addresses this gap. The problem has been expressed in terms of the experiences of the author and colleagues and has been received with interest by those individuals who have attended workshops and presentations given by the author on this topic. Research limitations/implications: The solutions proposed are based on the experiences and reflection of the author and colleagues. Additional research needs to be conducted to further support the conclusions drawn from the ideas in this paper. Practical implications: Significant changes should be made in the thinking of staff and team members in their approach to acquiring and maintaining the support of their managers. The recommended approach is a structured process of stakeholder engagement based on building and maintaining robust relationships with important stakeholders leading to the development of timely, appropriate and effective communication. Originality/value: The paper and the ideas expressed within it take a different approach to most of the published literature in that they seek to view organisational culture and practice from the perspective of staff or team members (followers) and how they might proceed to address issues that require management attention and support. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Effective communication; Management theory; Organizational activities; Project management; Stakeholder theory; Stakeholders",,"Bourne, L.; Stakeholder Management Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia; email: lyndab@stakeholder-management.com",,,00251747,,,,"English","Manage.

We reveal an apparent disconnect between the focus on sustainable products and processes and the orientation of the businesses within which they reside. Current agendas are characterised by a desire to create a more sustainable built environment, but with little regard for the businesses that enact such agendas. We argue that the firm is the enabler of a more holistic CSR agenda, and that sustainability needs to be present, visible and integrated in the business at all levels and in all functions of the sustainable construction organization. An archetype of a sustainable construction business is developed based on a synthesis of related literatures that could act as a framework for enacting responsible strategies in the future. In arguing for a 'business focus' we seek to broaden the current debates within the sustainable construction literature, and to open up new research trajectories around responsible sourcing, business ethics and organisational change for corporate sustainability, which have hitherto been underplayed within built environment research literature.","Construction business; Corporate strategy; CSR; Sustainability",,"Glass, J.; Department of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leics, LE11 3TU, United Kingdom; email: J.glass@lboro.ac.uk",,,15623599,,,,"English","Int.

The aim of this article is to contribute to the conceptual underpinning of a sincerity/hypocrisy index that positions an organization on a continuum from idealism to cynicism. Design/methodology/approach: Starting with the analysis of the reasons for the dissonance between message and reality, the drivers of ethical corporate behavior, the intention of the actors and the intensity of effort and of corporate communication were analysed. Findings: The analysis of the reasons for dissonance between message and reality sheds light on the role of communication in the perception of hypocrisy. An underlying model of a sincerity/hypocrisy index is proposed to position the firm on a continuum from idealism to hypocrisy in function of the degree of congruence or dissonance between communication and reality. Practical implications: This concept of sincerity index could form a valuable basis for the development of new evaluation instruments for rating agencies, screening institutions and other evaluation bodies.

It has been argued - and laid down in many national legal systems - that access to freshwater is a basic human right. What if corporate freshwater use threatens to interfere with this human right? The main focus of the article is to explore the role of todays companies in relation to freshwater. A number of tools have been developed to attend to the necessity to reduce corporate use of freshwater. The article discusses specialised water reporting instruments such as the 2007 Global Water Tool and the water footprint calculation method. In addition, attention is paid to a CERES report (2010) revealing that the majority of the 100 worlds leading companies in water-intensive industries still has weak management and disclosures of water-related risks and opportunities. To obtain concrete information about corporate water strategies and practices, an explorative analysis was conducted on 20 Dutch multinational companies. The article highlights various innovative practices. In sum, it is demonstrated that companies are expected to bear responsibility for their impact on water resources, in particular when it influences public access to water in areas with freshwater scarcity and/or weak government.

However, CSR is not a universally adopted concept as it is understood differentially despite increasing pressures for its incorporation into business practices.

We look for a consensus of understanding in an attempt to propose a more universal framework to enhance international adoption and practice of CSR using the triple bottom line. Our results concur with the findings of both national and international bodies and suggest that both within and among the countries in our study there exists no clear definition of the concept of CSR.

The paper argues that sustainability and corporate social responsibility are the key drivers of value resonance and service excellence. A case-study approach is used in the context of retail service providers, and the main case is the furniture company IKEA. Key values of our case are identified, analysed, and compared with values in other companies. The findings suggest that the innovation management of these firms has been characterised by: (1) business platforms (such as physical and web-based experience rooms) that facilitate their customers' service experiences; (2) service brand and marketing communication based on values resonance among the norms and ethical values of customers, the company, and the wider society; and (3) sharing of corporate values among leaders and employees to provide energy and direction for excellence and sustainable business development.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on an outline of current conceptualisations of employer branding, the paper discusses the strategic potentials of merging corporate branding processes, strategic HRM and CSR into a theoretical framework for reconceptualising employer branding as co-created processes and sustainable employer-employee relationships. Findings: When organizations adapt strategies for sustainable development (including CSR), it affects how to approach stakeholder relations and organizational processes, including the employee-employer relationship and employer branding processes. However, current employer branding conceptualisations do not comply with such changed corporate conditions. The suggested framework reconceptualises employer branding as an integrated part of a CSR strategy, thus offering a new way of approaching employer branding as supporting sustainable organizational development and long-term employer-employee relationships. Practical implications: The proposed conceptualisation of employer branding implies a shift in focus from end result to process. As part of the process, organizations need to approach employees as corporate partners in order to co-create employer-employee values.

Such studies play an important role in broadening people's knowledge of CSR under different economic, social and cultural conditions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the CSR reports (CSRRs) of listed companies in the largest emerging market, namely China. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a content analysis of 81 CSRRs (2007) of listed companies in domestic security markets of China (the Shanghai Security Exchanges and Shenzhen Security Exchange), the CSR features of Chinese companies are thoroughly evaluated. Findings: The main findings of the study are as follows. Only 5.05 percent of listed companies published their CSRRs in China, and 4.42 percent of them issued a separate CSRR. Most companies (97.18 percent) use ""CSRR"" as the name of their stand-alone CSRRs; 79 percent of companies hold a positive attitude to taking on social responsibilities, while no company holds a negative attitude. Various social issues and stakeholders of companies are addressed in CSRRs. In general, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have higher propensity to address most of social issues, which may reflect that SOEs are more politically sensitive than non-SOEs because most of the social issues are just ""political slogans"" proposed by the Chinese Government in recent years. However, non-SOEs have better performance than SOEs in addressing the interests of stakeholders. Meanwhile, industrial firms show higher propensity to address the interests of stakeholders than service firms. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study indicate that CSR reporting practice is still at an early stage of development in China. Meanwhile, Chinese companies tend to follow the Chinese guidelines in issuing CSRRs rather than adopt international guidelines. In addition, Chinese companies are somewhat politically sensitive in addressing social issues. A major weakness of this study is that the sample only represents the best companies in assuming social responsibilities in China, thus some results cannot be generalized to all Chinese companies.

In addition to a country-based description of the different forms, stakeholder categories, and topics of the SD initiatives, we explore the relationship between SD and characteristics of national business systems. Overall, we find firms undertake few SD initiatives, using low-involvement forms of dialog, and focusing on one category of stakeholders per initiative. Results suggest that the explicit approach to corporate social responsibility (CSR) favors the quantity of SD initiatives, but neglects the importance of the level of involvement and diversity of stakeholders participating at the dialog. Finally, we find public policies on CSR have a substantial influence on SD in national business systems with an implicit approach to CSR. Public policies based on a shared discussion involving multiple social actors encourage SD initiatives that use different forms of dialog and are characterized by high level of involvement.

It follows from the second element that these classes are no longer meant to train managers to make a more effective economic contribution.

An important question arises, however, regarding whether the corporate philanthropic contribution model is equally appropriate for all types of corporate social responsibility (CSR) (e.g. donation) in all business settings (e.g. Chinese listed firms' philanthropic responses to disaster). In this paper, we consider the unique two-tier board structure of Chinese listed firms and argue that firms with women on the board of directors (BOD) and the supervisory board (SB) are able to challenge this model. Data collected from Chinese listed firms' philanthropic responses to disaster extended the finding that the agency theory with moderators explains corporate philanthropic disaster response much better in the Chinese context. Specifically, the relationship between agency costs and corporate philanthropy (e.g. the likelihood of donation and extent of corporate contributions) weakens in listed firms with a higher vs. lower number of women on the SB. However, women on BODs do not have a similar effect. This constructive replication provides the first examination of the moderating role of women on BODs and SBs on corporate philanthropic behavior.

This article examines whether small organizations can foster societal change toward more sustainable modes of living. We contend that consumption is deeply intertwined with social relations and norms, thus making individual behavioral change toward sustainability a matter of facilitating change in individual behavior, as well as in social norms and relations between organizations and consumers. We argue that it is in this facilitation process that small firms can play a major role, by adopting upstream and downstream approaches to diffuse behavioral change. By synthesizing four key strands of literature - small businesses and corporate social responsibility, ethical consumption, community social marketing, and the diffusion of innovation - and using the exemplar case of Modbury, the iconic ""plastic bag-free"" town, we demonstrate how responsible small firms can influence communities, and the individuals therein, to encourage environmentally sustainable practice to diffuse and support change in society. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","community; CSR; small business; social marketing; sustainability",,"Carrigan, M.; Open University Business School, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, United Kingdom; email: m.carrigan@open.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

It is predicted that the variables' company size, amount of philanthropic expenditure, region and industry influence the extent to which the various impact dimensions of philanthropy are measured. Though unexpected considering the lack of common practice in impact measurement, it is found that between 62 and 76% of the DJSI firms measure some sort of impact of their philanthropic activities, mostly impact on society and impact on reputation and stakeholder satisfaction. The number of firms that measure impact increases over the years and so does the number of firms that measure multiple dimensions of impact.

Both used a comprehensive approach to stakeholder engagement, using a transactive planning approach that sought to establish a participatory and inclusive framework for stakeholders to engage in multi-loop learning and corresponding action to achieve sustainable tourism planning outcomes. A seven-stage stakeholder engagement process was used, bringing together stakeholder consultation workshops, setting up a destination planning website to accept broader community input, as well as creating Stakeholder Reference Groups and citizen's juries. The process continued with consultation reports, workshops, draft plans and the communication and implementation of the final plan.

Previous literature, maintaining the need for a marketing approach to festivals, identifies the need for maintaining strong stakeholder relationships in order to succeed in a business environment; attention has been focused to the theory of relationship marketing (RM) because of the recognition that this practice is complementary to the marketing of festivals. The very nature of the music festival as an annual, usually, 4-day event means that effective marketing is needed to keep connections with the consumer throughout the year. This article focuses on the RM techniques utilised within the music festival industry from the viewpoint of the festival organiser in an attempt to establish how festival organisations value and monitor organisational relationships. This article explores the extent to which these relationships are valued and managed; furthermore, the variations between these intricate relationships are considered by focusing on those held with the organisation's consumers and sponsors, the results of which have provided the ability to establish the importance and relevance of RM to the industry and further identify the marketing communication methods employed to establish and maintain such relationships. In-depth, convergent interviews have been conducted with a segment of music festival organisers from a range of events. The results have been integrated with the study of current literature to best exemplify these issues. It has been established that RM has a strong role in today's commercial and independent music festival industry; technological advances are enabling the organiser to support online relationships further and increase consumer loyalty.

Specifically, individualistic, relational, or collectivistic identity orientations can describe a firm's level of CSP activity toward certain stakeholders. Family firms, we suggest, adopt a more relational orientation toward their stakeholders than nonfamily firms, and thus engage in higher levels of CSP. Further, we invoke collectivistic identity orientation to argue that the higher the level of family or founder involvement within a family firm, the greater the level of CSP toward specific stakeholders. Using social performance rating data from 1991 to 2005, we find that family and nonfamily firms demonstrate notable differences in terms of social initiatives and social concerns.

The effectiveness of these codes has been widely discussed on theoretical grounds and empirically tested in numerous previous reports that directly compare companies with and without codes of conduct. Empirical research has yielded inconsistent results that may be explained by multiple ancillary factors, including the quality of code content and implementation, which are excluded from analyses based solely on the presence or absence of codes. This study investigated the importance of code content in determining code effectiveness by examining the relationship between code of conduct quality and ethical performance. Companies maintaining high quality codes of conduct were significantly more represented among top CSR ranking systems for corporate citizenship, sustainability, ethical behavior, and public perception. Further, a significant relationship was observed between code quality and CSR performance, across a full range of ethical rankings. These findings suggest code quality may play a crucial role in the effectiveness of codes of conduct and their ability to transform organizational cultures.

However, it remains an open question as to how real-life managers actually view stakeholders and what rationales and logics are used for explaining the relationship between the firm and its constituencies. This article examines whom managers in multinational corporations (MNCs) consider to be their important stakeholders, and how they describe the societal responsibilities towards these groups and individuals.

Through the analysis of annual sustainability reports, we have determined the existence of three types of rhetoric: (1) strategic (embedded in the scientific-economic paradigm); (2) institutional (based on the fundamental constructs of Corporate Social Responsibility theories); and (3) dialectic (which aims at improving the discursive quality between the corporations and their stakeholders). Each one of these refers to a different form of legitimacy and is based on distinct theories of the firm analyzed in this article. We claim that dialectic rhetoric seems to signal a new understanding of the firm's role in society and a search for moral legitimation. However, this new form of rhetoric is still fairly uncommon although its use is growing. Combining theory and business examples, this article may help managers and researchers in the conceptualization of how firms make sense of their role in society and what forms of differentiation they strive for through their rhetoric strategies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business and society; business ethics; Corporate Social Responsibility; discourse analysis; globalization; organizational legitimacy; rhetoric",,"Castelló, I.; CBS Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility (cbsCSR), Copenhagen Business School and Institute for Social Innovation, ESADE Business School, Universitat Ramon Llull, Porcelænshaven 18A, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; email: ic.ikl@cbs.dk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is quantitative in nature using the responses of 275 bank customers who answered a survey questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using partial least squares (PLS), a variance-based structural equation modeling method. Findings: The results of the study demonstrate that corporate social responsibility (CSR) has a significantly strong and positive association with attitudinal loyalty. Perceived service quality mediated the relationship between CSR and repeat patronage intentions (behavioral loyalty). Direct effects were reported between perceived service quality and both attitudinal and behavioral loyalty. A positive relationship between attitudinal and behavioral loyalty was demonstrated. Research limitations/implications: While the results are clear and have strong salience for the retail banking industry, future research should take into account the specific industry context within the national culture. Practical implications: The study provides a set of findings relating to CSR initiatives and perception of service quality that could be readily incorporated into banks' corporate strategic plans.

Drawing from prior literature, the paper is built around three basic questions in relation to the Greek context: how is CSR perceived by Greek business professionals? How is CSR practised in Greece? And which issues evident in the modern domestic environment act as underlying barriers to the broader dissemination of CSR in Greece? The extant empirical work suggests that, while CSR in Greece appears to be developing, there is still scope for improvement and further diffusion of relevant practices.

Drawing from Kohlberg's seminal theory of moral development, CSR is conceptualised as the development of organisation moral reasoning, and the proposition is illustrated by demonstrating inter-disciplinary similarities in levels of ethical concern within different approaches to the practice of marketing, human resource management (HRM) and performance management. Levels of concern for CSR are related to environmental and firm-specific drivers and constraints that influence the CSR dynamic. Environmental influences on organisational CSR stances emanate from a range of stakeholder constituencies, while the importance accorded to CSR is also influenced by firm-specific factors such as the organisation's stage of development, strategy and leadership. The paper's identification of inter-disciplinary similarities in the varying levels of concern for CSR and its delineation of CSR drivers and constraints contribute to CSR theory, and these frameworks also represent analytical tools that managers can use to assess or to change an organisation's CSR stance. The multi-level perspective on CSR adopted by the paper links an organisation's overall or 'macro' CSR stance to the 'meso' levels of CSR represented by practice within its specialist functions. It proposes that the 'CSR at a tipping point' proposition is assessed by utilising the conceptual model in the paper within a case-study research design to determine whether specific organisations - identified as 'CSRpositive' ones by their relatively high level of concern for stakeholder welfare - are changing the importance they accord to CSR as a result of the new business context, and the extent to which practice in their marketing, HRM and performance management functions are shapers or consequences of this. © 2011 The Authors.",,,"Mason, C.; Liverpool Business School, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom",,,09628770,,,,"English","Bus.

When looking at the future, corruption appears as the major concern, almost certainly due to the political, social, and ethical context that many of the nations in the region are experiencing. There is a strong need for more business schools and NGOs to join the task of researching, teaching and training in the broad spectrum of areas that fall within the scope of the field of business and economic ethics. In this respect, the need is glaring and the opportunities are enormous. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business Ethics (BE); Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Latin America (LA); Research; Teaching; Training",,"Bissières, A.

The countries surveyed are Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. The diversity across countries in the region is high in terms of economic development, political structuring and human development. The degree of privatization and globalization is varied across countries since each of them is in a different phase of transition. In an earlier survey on Business Ethics, published in 1997, India was the only country from this region that was represented. In the current survey, 12 countries from the South and South East Asia are represented. While Business Ethics in academia is widely present, Corporate Social Responsibility, Governance and Sustainability though relatively new appear to be growing rapidly. Business Ethics courses tend to focus on functional ethics, managerial ethics and implementing codes of ethical conduct. Across the 12 countries, Business Ethics is taught either as an elective or a core course in most institutions. Training emphasis across countries is varied. While training institutions in India appear to be high, the presence of multinational consultants in Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is significant. The research focus across countries in the region is weak. The high convergence on the top issues in Business Ethics, across respondents in different countries, is worthy of mention. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Asia; Business; CSR; Ethics; Research; Teaching; Training",,"Srinivasan, V.; Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, India; email: vasanthi@iimb.ernet.in",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

The focus is on the following aspects: incentive, quantity, focus, use of non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. Design/methodology/approach: The data are based on a comprehensive questionnaire survey addressed to investor-relation managers (IRMs) at the largest companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Findings: The study confirms an increasing focus of non-financial information related to intangible assets in corporate disclosure. This increase appears to be both regulatory and demand driven. Encouraging indeed is that management teams seem to have acknowledged the importance not only to describe the less tangible values per se, but also to explain the roles they play in the value-creation process and in corporate strategy. Furthermore, the study reveals a trend shift from research and development (R&D) and relational information towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) and employee-related information, an increasing number of non-financial KPIs and a positive attitude to mandatory requirements. Overall, the findings indicate that voluntary disclosure compensates for the deficiencies of financial statements to properly disclose intangible assets. This may lessen the risk of the argued impairment of the efficient allocation of resources on the stock market. Practical implications: The findings reveal that quite a few challenges lie ahead in shaping efficient corporate disclosures where also intangible assets are in focus. The most critically relate to dealing with the concerns of reliability and comparability associated with disclosures of intangible assets and their related non-financial KPIs. This needs to be taken on promptly by management teams, policy makers and financial market regulators if the corporate-disclosure process shall function efficiently and facilitate decreased information asymmetry and uphold an efficient allocation of resources on the stock market. Originality/value: Herein not only one aspect related to disclosure of non-financial information is being analysed, but also several and from a management-team perspective, which is a perspective often neglected for the sophisticated-user perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Annual report; Disclosure; Intangible assets; Intellectual Assets; Non-financial information",,"Arvidsson, S.; Department of Business Administration, School of Economics and Management, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; email: Susanne.Arvidsson@fek.lu.se",,,14691930,,,,"English","J.

Others claim that CEOs strategically choose CSR activities to reduce the probability of CEO turnover in a future period through indirect support from activists. Still others assert that firms use CSR activities to signal their product quality. We find that firms use governance mechanisms, along with CSR engagement, to reduce conflicts of interest between managers and non-investing stakeholders. Employing a large and extensive sample of firms within Russell 2000, S&500 and Domini 400 indices during the 1993-2004 period, we find that consistent with the conflict-resolution hypothesis, the CSR choice is positively associated with governance characteristics, including board independence, institutional ownership, and analyst following. In addition, after correcting for endogeneity of CSR engagement, our results show that CSR engagement positively influences operating performance and firm value, supporting the conflict-resolution hypothesis as opposed to the over-investment and strategic-choice arguments.

Present concepts combine direct money transfer with co-production, knowledge sharing and the development of products and services designed for the need of developing and transition economies. The concept of micro-financing is a financial service which has proven to allow for entrepreneurs in the respective countries to start up their businesses. A relatively new financial product for these countries is micro-insurance. This article deals with the question whether consumers in the Netherlands are willing to donate micro-insurances and which factors influence this willingness to contribute to the non-profit micro-insurance approach of an insurance company. The data were collected with questionnaires among a sample of the Dutch population (N = 504). The data have been processed in a one-way between-groups ANOVA, a paired sample t test and an ordinal regression analysis. The results show that approximately half of the Dutch consumers are willing to pay an additional amount on their insurance premium for the donation of micro-insurances. The amount of the insurance premium did, however, not affect the willingness to donate (WTD). If consumers could choose the beneficiary less people are willing to donate, yet those people are willing to donate more money. In conclusion, there is readiness among consumers to contribute to micro-insurance via an insurance company that assists in setting up micro-insurance projects. This indicates a possible role for companies to act as an intermediary between philanthropic acts and consumers. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","consumer behaviour; corporate social responsibility; micro-insurance; willingness to donate",,"Jansen, P.; Interpolis, Marketing Intelligence, Spoorlaan 298, 5017 JZ Tilburg, Netherlands; email: pcp.jansen@interpolis.nl",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

In order to answer this question, a sociological, system theoretical approach is applied which approaches values not pre-empirically as invisible drivers for action but as observable semantics that form organisational behaviour. In terms of empirical material, it will be shown that business organisations resort to a communication of values whenever uncertainty or complexity is very high. Inevitably, value semantics are applied in organisations first when the speakers are uncertain about which stakeholders to whom they have to address (uncertainty) or when different stakeholder groups have to be addressed simultaneously (complexity); second, when the identity of the organisation has to be described; and third, when future strategic options that cannot be expressed by quantitative terms have to be communicated. Values accordingly play a role in organisational practice when certain aspects are indeterminate. Therefore, they are a means for organisations to communicate under fuzzy circumstances. On the basis of these findings, new approaches to value management can now be formulated. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","communication; Corporate Social Responsibility; Niklas Luhmann; sociology; system theory; value communication; value-based management; value-based semantics",,"von Groddeck, V.; Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU), Munich, Germany; email: victoria@vongroddeck.de",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

One tendency noted in the literature is that CR communication is organised and structured. Corporations tend to professionalise CR communication in the sense that they provide information that corresponds to demands for transparency that are voiced by certain stakeholders. This also means that experts within the firm tend to communicate with professional stakeholders outside the firm. In this article, a particular aspect of the organisation of CR communication is examined, a phenomenon that we refer to as the 'filtration effect'. By comparing CR communication in parent companies and their subsidiaries, we show empirically that there is considerably less CR communication on the subsidiary level compared to the parent level. We see filtration as a sign of conscious organising of CR communication that implies particular attention to certain stakeholder groups with clearly defined demands and expectations on companies. The strong filtration effect noted in the study suggests that CR communication does not seem to be very much adapted to customers, which may be problematic both from a communicative and ethical perspective.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether the existing audit regulatory framework adequately serves the legitimate interests of stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: This study is the first to collect survey data on audit regulatory issues in the post-Lehman Brothers environment. In total, 190 responses to a mail survey were collected from Big Four auditors and from 166 CEOs. Stakeholder theory is used to analyse these responses. Findings: The results indicate that Big Four auditors and CEOs perceive the disclosure of post-audit report event evidence to be important in discharging their ethical obligations. Both groups agreed that issuing timely audit reports is important, and that ""introducing quarterly audit reporting"" is a necessary step to enhance corporate governance. A risk-based auditing approach necessitates the introduction of quarterly reporting. The findings support the notion underlying business risk auditing (BRA) models developed in public practice and the literature. CEOs are acutely aware of their corporate responsibilities to the company's stakeholders, and demonstrate that they understand the core insights of stakeholder theory by applying this theory in the corporations they manage. These results support the assertion that stakeholder theory has managerial implications and intrinsic value. CEOs comply with their audit disclosure obligations in several ways. Based on the results, a refined stakeholder model is proposed and immediate regulatory reform is recommended.

How many should they target? How to allocate attention/efforts among them? Based on stakeholders and market orientation research this paper aims to address these dilemmas. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a survey of managers in a cross-industry sample of 115 firms. The authors first identify a specific group of salient stakeholders - those providing the firm with revenues and financial support. The article then studies the conditions under which firms should adopt a key approach to stakeholders' management - a ""generalist"" stakeholder strategy, that is, deal with a larger number of revenue and funding producing stakeholder types, and/or more evenly spread attention/efforts among them. Findings: The findings suggest that a generalist stakeholder strategy has a positive effect on firms' performance among resource-rich firms and among firms who face dissimilar (""unrelated"") stakeholders. Also, degree of environmental volatility was not found to moderate the relationship between a generalist stakeholder strategy and firms' performance. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the marketing and stakeholder literatures by identifying and studying a group of important stakeholders beyond final consumers - those providing the firm with revenues and financial support, and by studying the conditions under which firms benefit from one key approach to stakeholders - a ""generalist"" stakeholder strategy. The study's limitations characterize most cross-sectional survey research (e.g. single informants, subjective performance assessments). However, substantial efforts were made to ensure the validity and robustness of the findings. Practical implications: The study offers managers insight into the organizational and environmental conditions under which firms should adopt a generalist stakeholder strategy. Originality/value: This is one of the few papers that integrate into the marketing literature the study of stakeholders. Specifically, it introduces the concept of a generalist stakeholder strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumers; Management strategy; Marketing strategy; Stakeholder analysis",,"Grinstein, A.; Guilford Glazer School of Business and Management, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel; email: gramir@bgu.ac.il",,,03090566,,,,"English","Eur.

Our paper sketches how one could address and develop microinsurance business ethics. First, we introduce microinsurance to the business ethics community and business ethics to the microinsurance community. Our draft of microinsurance ethics is then developed from two angles: as a holistic understanding of ideals and possible ethical conflicts in key stakeholder relationships and by distinguishing eight challenges when targeting the poor and when marketing microinsurance.

This article examines the curious fact that most business ethics scholars use concepts, principles, and normative methods for identifying and justifying these beyond-compliance obligations that are very different from the ones that are used to set the levels of regulations themselves. Its modest proposal-a plea for a research agenda, really-is that we could reduce this normative asymmetry by borrowing from the normative framework of ""regulation"" to identify and justify an important range of beyond-compliance obligations. In short, we might think of ""self-regulation"" as a language and a normative framework with some distinct advantages over other frameworks like stakeholder theory, corporate social responsibility, corporate citizenship, and the like. These other frameworks have been under attack in the business ethics literature of late, primarily for their vagueness and their disappointing inability to distinguish clearly between genuine beyond-compliance moral obligations, on the one hand, and charitable acts that are laudable but not morally obligatory, on the other. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Beyond-compliance obligations; Business ethics; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Market failure; Regulation; Self-regulation; Stakeholder theory",,"Norman, W.; Duke University, Durham, NC, United States; email: wayne.norman@duke.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Research Question: Is the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate social responsibility (CSR) contingent on satisfaction with firm performance? Research Findings/Insights: Our results suggest that while effective corporate governance discourages both positive (proactive stakeholder relationship management) and negative (violation of regulations and standards) CSR, higher slack and positive attainment discrepancy lead to higher positive and lower negative CSR, respectively. More significantly, we find that the association between effective corporate governance and both positive and negative CSR depends on satisfaction with firm performance as indicated by the levels of slack and attainment discrepancy. Put simply, the impact of corporate governance on positive CSR is more pronounced under low slack/negative attainment discrepancy conditions, and that on negative CSR is more pronounced under high slack/positive attainment discrepancy conditions. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study provides robust support for the behavioral theory of the firm. Previous research has not adequately considered the role of satisfaction with firm performance in studying the impact of corporate governance on managerial decision-making. We show that the association between corporate governance and CSR dimensions depends on differences in decision-making latitude originating from relative firm performance compared to those of peer firms. Practitioner/Policy Implications: First, to understand how effective corporate governance can constrain positive CSR and more importantly reduce negative CSR. Second, to appreciate that the effectiveness of an organization's governance mechanisms is contingent on slack and performance and the marginal returns from improving governance mechanisms when things are going well may be low. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Attainment Discrepancy; Behavioral Theory of the Firm (BTOF); Corporate Governance; Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Organizational Slack",,"Arora, P.; Martin J.

It focuses mainly on identifying the strategies and discourses employed by the IFC in this pursuit and possible lessons for the diffusion of CSR discourse in developing economies. Although CSR discourses in most developing economies are based on philanthropy, a key finding is that the IFC promotes CSR through a business language that aligns to profitability objectives. In addition, the IFC has continued to deploy both collaborative and complementary discursive entrepreneurial strategies to further the spread of sustainable project finance principles. It emphasizes the role of the IFC in discursive institutionalism and highlights the implications of this for CSR in developing economies. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Corporate social responsibility; Csr discourse; Developing economies; Institutional change",,"Amaeshi, K.; University of Edinburgh Business School, Lagos Business School, Nigeria and Doughty Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Cranfield School of Management, 29 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9JS, United Kingdom; email: kenneth.amaeshi@cranfield.ac.uk",,,14697017,,,,"English","J.

This paper investigates the changing approaches towards sustainable development undertaken by the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) over a period of approximately 20 years. The analysis begins in the early 1990s when MAC initiated the Whitehorse Mining Initiative (WMI) and concludes in 2010 when the association was operating under a strategy entitled Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM). The goal is to consider the nature of the learning that has taken place towards sustainability within the mineral industry using the case of a leading national mining association. The investigation was undertaken through a literature review as well as key informant interviews with stakeholders affected by the Canadian Mining Industry. Findings suggest that MAC's approach to sustainable development has shifted from an ambitious and holistic partnership involving a range of stakeholders to a focused, member-specific agenda that addresses a few performance issues. The transition to TSM was based on lessons learned through working with the WMI and subsequent efforts. It reflects broader corporate tendencies to address social and ecological issues through corporate social responsibility initiatives. The implications of these trends suggest that voluntary initiatives in and of themselves should not be expected to replace the comprehensive regulatory responsibilities historically provided by government. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Projects such as school and hospital construction, that were intended to improve living standards, contributed to the implementation of this Western mandate. There is a fair amount of evidence that such a colonial mandate has survived in the postcolonial era, as its rationale still shapes some of the CSR trends in contemporary Africa. This colonial legacy reinforces the continuity thesis in the assessment of foreign-led development issues. However, a case study in the Ghanaian mining sector reveals that there has also been a break with this colonial pattern. In a changing context, actors frame a local norm much attuned to their concerns, and negotiate the corporate narrative and practices. Such negotiation was not possible under the colonial regime of forced labour. Nonetheless, the change that would really matter and would ensure social justice for all has to take place beyond this opposition between conflicting interest groups, in which workers are pitted against the local community. Taking into account the status of the marginalized, who are not always the local community but dispossessed workers, the article suggests that the postcolonial principle of otherness should be supplemented by the principle of difference, whereby preference is given to the least favoured in the discussion of the role of business in postcolonial societies. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Civilizing mission; CSR; Development; Ghana; Postcolonialism",,"Adanhounme, A.

It is seen as an effective way to build brands, create product awareness, revitalize corporate values and make corporate social responsibility and community involvement visible. It has proven to be an important marketing tool and offers valuable contributions in addressing corporate needs in the context of societal issues and the related needs of charities and causes. CRM is implemented by juxtaposing the strategic objectives of a business with traditional marketing communication tools in association with the needs and objectives of a specific charity or social cause. In fact, CRM is among the most popular forms of corporate giving. It provides the means to use the power of a brand to publicly demonstrate a firm's commitment in addressing some (or a) social issues of the day while simultaneously seeking to achieve marketing and corporate objectives such as new product introduction, increasing sales or building reputation within a local or national market. Each of these may be taken as a general or specific objective in implementing CRM in particular contextual circumstances. Thus, outcomes underpin CRM's application specifically in a given geographic brand associated context, while general outcomes underpin CRM's application in wider and potentially different brand or indeed geographic circumstances. This paper discusses the efforts of BMW (Cyprus) in working toward the above objectives and highlights a partnership with the Cyprus Football Association in supporting a charitable organization in the fight against drug addiction while creating product and brand awareness regarding the 320i model in the national market that is, a specific contextual applicatory analysis. The outcomes show that CRM can be a very effective way of enabling a firm and its employees to display and live up to their corporate values (Chong; Kitchen and Schultz) and communicate these to key stakeholder groups such as customers, the local community and society at large. Thus, BMW (Cyprus) successfully used CRM as a strategy and a promotional tactic to underpin brand awareness and develop a new product, while simultaneously enhancing corporate reputation by highlighting its cultural values. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","BMW; cause related marketing (CRM); corporate social responsibility (CSR); corporate values; Cyprus; new products",,"Papasolomou, I.; Marketing Department, School of Business Administration, University of Nicosia, Nicosia, Cyprus",,,13633589,,,,"English","Corp.

Data from two qualitative research projects on CSR initiatives in the soccer ball industry of Sialkot, Pakistan, are utilized to explore this issue in an inductive and exploratory manner. The article suggests that many soccer ball manufacturers in Sialkot perceive CSR as part of the wider historic project of Western imperialism in the developing world through which economic resources are extracted from local manufacturers while their perceptions of what constitutes socially responsible behaviour are delegitimized. This counter-discourse of CSR as Western imperialism paves the way for an alternative reading of CSR that challenges both more management-oriented mainstream conceptions of CSR and more critical contributions to the CSR and development literature.

Others suggest the aid generated is problematic in and of itself because it keeps Africa from becoming self-sufficient. This research contends the purpose of the Gap's participation is genuine, going beyond window dressing and the surface level benefit of capitalistic enterprise, and is in fact linked to a higher motive of propagating ethical trade which ultimately offers African beneficiaries a path to financial independence.

In this regard, both donors and SPE executives use efficiency information in making decisions. Here, we suggest a linked, two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology for assessing efficiency in both charitable fundraising and cause delivery, while empirically investigating results for international aid organizations. The model allows efficiency assessment for both the fundraising and utilization of generated funds when directed for cause-related purposes. This, in particular, allows for measurement of the organization's managerial efficiency relative to both multiple phased goals and peer organizations. Additionally, the approach provides benchmarks for identifying sources of improved performance in fundraising and program/cause service delivery. It can also project the results of changes in inputs on the amount of resources available for the charitable organization's cause. The proposed model(s) allow the examiner to assess performance while, at the same time, identifying those instances wherein the simple ratio measures commonly used in non-profit assessment are (1) deficient, and/or (2) misleading because of the use of 'incorrect' variables, or the 'hiding' of inefficiency if/when tax form categories are filed by an SPE.

In this paper, I examine Hansmann's own argument in support of this view, in order to draw out its implications for some of the traditional concerns of business ethicists about corporate social responsibility. The centerpiece of Hansmann's argument is the claim that ownership of the firm is most naturally exercised by the group able to achieve the lowest agency costs, and that homogeneity of interest within the ownership group is the most important factor in achieving lower costs. He defends this claim through a study of cooperatives, attempting to show that homogeneity is the source of the competitive advantage most often enjoyed by shareholders over other constituency groups, such as workers, suppliers and customers, when it comes to exercising control over the firm. Some business ethicists, impressed by this argument, have taken it to be a vindication of Milton Friedman's claim that profit-maximization is the only ""social responsibility"" of management. I would like to suggest that this conclusion does not follow, and that the ""Hansmann argument"" lends itself to a less minimalist view, what I refer to as a ""market failures"" approach to business ethics. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cooperatives; Efficiency; Henry Hansmann; Ownership; Shareholder primacy",,"Heath, J.; Department of Philosophy and School of Public Policy and Governance, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; email: joseph.heath@utoronto.ca",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

We demonstrate how different types of negative externalities present firms with different strategic opportunities in terms of harnessing market-driven CSR demand. © 2011 SAGE Publications.","negative externalities; social acceptability; strategic CSR; transaction costs; value creation; willingness to pay",,"Daudigeos, T.; Grenoble Ecole de Management, Office F611, 12 rue Pierre Semard, BP 127, Grenoble Cedex 01, 38003, France; email: thibault.daudigeos@grenoble-em.com",,,00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

In general, empirical research on the impact of environmental practices on organisational outcomes is limited and inconclusive, thus a greater understanding of the consequences associated with successful corporate environmental (CE) organisations is needed. Design/methodology/approach: Eight in-depth interviews were conducted with leading and proactive CE organisations in New Zealand. Findings: General consequences including innovation, strategic alliances, and improved public relations were found in addition to consequences specifically related to product/service, process-, and project-dominant environmental marketing strategies. Negative consequences were also identified. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the broad nature of the study, it is not possible to make substantial inferences between different industries or specific organisation types and environmental marketing strategies. The size of the sample further limits data generalisability. Practical implications: Practically, it is anticipated the research will provide guidance for marketing and management leaders in organisations to gain a greater understanding of the consequences associated with environmental strategies. Managers need awareness of the potential impacts of choosing an environmental orientation and strategy. Originality/value: This research provides the first empirical evidence regarding the consequences for CE organisations except those with previous support relating to organisation performance, brand attitude, employee attitude, and employee commitment and esprit de corps. Several new consequences not previously suggested in previous literature are identified. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management; Interviews; Marketing strategy; New Zealand",,"Ozanne, L.

Taking as our starting point Levinas' demanding view of responsibility as 'following the assignation of responsibility for my neighbour', we use a case study of a packaging company-PackCo-to argue that a concern with being seen and/or seeing oneself as responsible should not be confused with actual responsibility. Our analysis of the case points first to the allure of programmes of strategic corporate responsibility and the ways in which, through identification, they can provide a tacit form of moral sanction to managers in their aggressive pursuit of profit. It then contrasts the responses of different managers to negative staff feedback to illustrate the difference between managers' attempts to defend their identity of being 'responsible' managers, and responsible conduct itself. The paper concludes that a potent danger of programmes of corporate responsibility is that they allow managers to deceive not just others, but also themselves in relation to the exercise of responsibility. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate responsibility; Ethical identity; Ethics; Levinas",,"Roberts, J.; Discipline of Accounting, University of Sydney Business School, Building H 69, Cnr Codrington and Rose Streets, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia; email: john.roberts@sydney.edu.au",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Then, we are offered a response to the diagnosis: charity in truth, ""the principle around which the Church's social doctrine turns, a principle that takes on practical form in the criteria that govern moral action."" (CV 6) In business ethics, the norms of personal and (especially) corporate responsibility are the natural correlates to ""the criteria that govern moral action.""

We suggest that the existing governance structures are based on an outdated paradigm of business, rooted in economics. We propose an alternative paradigm, a more humanistic paradigm, which allows conceiving alternative, network-oriented governance structures. As hierarchical firms grow larger and more complex, the risk of failure increases from biases, errors, and missing data in communication and control systems. These problems are exacerbated by information overload on senior managers, directors, and their respective regulators. In contrast to traditional corporate governance, network governance introduces a division of power via multiple boards, checks and balances, and active stakeholder engagement. We argue that those features could have prevented the stresses and failures of financial firms in 2008, since they were anticipated by both individuals within firms and external commentators. However, those exposed to risks possessed insufficient influence in either governing and/or regulating firms to take corrective action. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate governance; cybernetics; decision making; economism; humanism; network governance; risk management",,"Pirson, M.; Fordham University, New York, NY, United States; email: pirson@fordham.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Specifically, we spotlight the dimensions of control and accountability that collectively determine stakeholder exposure, and show how this new construct affects the linkages between supply chain capabilities, configuration, and performance.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 145 executives and managers interested in project management was conducted. Data were analyzed using principal components analyses with varimax rotation for both behavioral- and outcome-based items. Relationships between variables were analyzed via path analysis. Findings: In total, five sponsor behavior factors were identified including: ensure planning, clarify outputs, stakeholder relationships, support project, and appoint project manager. Additionally, three outcome factors were found: firm's future, meeting agreements (e.g. budgets, scheduling expectations), and customer success. An estimated path model testing the effects of sponsor behaviors on project outcomes indicated six significant paths. Research limitations/implications: This paper empirically identifies behaviors sponsors may use during project planning and the impact such behaviors have on project success measures. The exploratory nature of this study suggests further research to confirm findings. Practical implications: This paper provides executive sponsors with a focus during the planning stage when various stakeholders are determining many project details. Originality/value: The paper adds to the limited body of research on the role of project sponsors.

Many scholars believe that only humans can be moral agents, and therefore business needs to create models that foster greater receptivity to others through ethical dialog. This view leads to a difficulty if no specific person is the sole causal agent for an act, or if something comes about through aggregated action in a corporate setting. An alternate approach suggests that corporations are moral agents sufficiently like humans to be treated as persons, which leads to questions of intentionality and the organizational structure required to support the claim. In this article, I make an intermediate claim combining Goodpaster and Matthews' (60:132-141, 1982) view that a corporation may have a moral culture which affects subjective choices, with those of Painter-Morland (17(3):515-534, 2007) who points out that we should move from a model that posits discrete persons acting on each other to one where morality comes about through shared experience between agents who participate in each other's lives. I argue that the discussion has been trapped in traditional dichotomies, and is better served by language that more accurately represents the dynamic interplay between organization and individual. I underwrite this claim by looking at recent changes in British and American legal approaches to corporate responsibility. These provide greater incentives for owners and business leaders to encourage employees to discuss the reflexive nature of legal and moral responsibility in business, facilitate workers to voice their moral concerns, and create structures and processes that allow those concerns to be heard. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Affine agency; Corporate personhood; Moral agency; Responsibility; Teleopathy",,"Gibson, K.; Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, United States; email: Kevin.Gibson@Marquette.edu",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Qualitative research conducted in the US demonstrated the content validity of this measure of reputation. Quantitative studies with multiple samples of participants validated the simplified measure in different geographical locations and confirmed the measure's ability to assess perceptions across stakeholder groups.

A value-laden concept such as sustainable construction, which emerges from a multi-stakeholder perspective, involves participation of the whole supply chain and incorporates the notion of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Creating sustainable habitats has societal as well as economic implications. While the UK government's Department of Trade and Industry is promoting CSR as a business contribution to sustainable development, many have argued that corporate citizenship takes shape at the point of government failure in the facilitation of citizen's rights. Recent research demonstrates varying degrees of corporate social performance (CSP) in different sectors and there are differing relationships between CSP and innovation in the real estate and construction sectors. A conceptual model linking corporate citizenship values (CCV) and CSP through corporate behaviour (BCORP) from a CSR and stakeholder theory perspective is developed.

Design/methodology/approach - Soft law initiatives are categorized into company codes, industry-initiated codes, and general codes in order to determine more accurately the effectiveness of the codes in enforcing CSR standards. A number of factors relevant in determining the effectiveness of such codes are identified and applied. Partnerships between soft law initiatives and hard laws are illustrated. Findings - Soft law initiatives are necessary tools in CSR. However, transparency, implementation, monitoring and compliance mechanisms are core areas in which the effectiveness of the initiatives needs improvement.

This article firstly discusses the concept of external assurance as defined by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and its limited application to date outside the statutory financial statement audit. The article then discusses the experience of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) in applying the IAASB framework for external assurance in practice. The benefit of external assurance is primarily to enhance confidence in information for the benefit of users of information who have little control over its production. However, the benefit of external assurance potentially can extend beyond enhancing the credibility of information. Through a case study of developing an assurance reporting framework on internal control in the United Kingdom in 2006, the article firstly demonstrates the benefit of stakeholder engagement in the process. By taking part in collective decision-making over the scope of reporting and related responsibilities, stakeholders obtain a better understanding of the role of assurance reporting and thus are able to align their expectations. Collectively agreeing the basic elements of an assurance reporting framework also means that parties need not negotiate them along with other individual engagement terms, thereby saving time and cost. Secondly, where stakeholders decide to opt for an assertion-based assurance reporting framework, management reports on its internal control procedures and their effectiveness and professional accountants opine on management assertions. This assurance process can facilitate better governance as management explicitly owns primary responsibility over the information rather than attributing it to external accountants. The article finally considers the use of external assurance reporting in a wider context. Assurance services, conducted on a voluntary basis and outside the scope of a statutory financial statements audit, can enhance the credibility of specific information that is relevant to certain stakeholders without adding unnecessary burdens to others that have little to gain from this assurance process. This may be particularly relevant to financial institutions subject to increased scrutiny because of the recent crisis in the banking sector. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Assurance; ICAEW; Internal control; Reporting; Stakeholder; Standards development",,"Iwasaki, J.; Assurance, Audit and Assurance Faculty, ICAEW, Chartered Accountants' Hall, Moorgate Place, London EC2P 2BJ, United Kingdom; email: jo.iwasaki@icaew.com",,,17413591,,,,"English","Int.

Therefore, objectivity is at the core of behavioural science. This science of behaviour can help us produce more effective implementations of safety solutions. Behaviour-based safety (BBS) processes most typically involve careful observation of behaviour, feedback, and reinforcement designed to change behaviour in strategic ways. BBS processes recognise the workplace environment as the dominant factor in the creation of safe working. This focus on behaviour needs to be coordinated with the elimination of work hazards. The authors' basic premise is that workplace injuries are reduced when their causes are understood.

Design/methodology/approach: For the period 2008 to mid-2009, the author surveyed articles in mainstream media and business periodicals focusing on corporate social responsibility; reviewed polls for methodology and results; searched press releases for mention of corporate social responsibility; and interviewed professionals employed in the field. The author sought quantifiable examples of corporate financial support for programs in light of the recessionary economy. The author also looked to define today's corporate social responsibility as a philosophy reflecting the values of environmentalism, corporate transparency, community investment, diversity programs and other social benefits. Findings: CSR is a wide-ranging global movement advocating good corporate citizenship through such values as sustainability, corporate transparency, business ethics, workforce diversity, philanthropy, quality, service to community and workforce education. Even as corporations shed costs by the billions, CSR programs are thriving. The reasons are complex, but involve the conflation of CSR with environmentalism, and the apparent genuineness of corporate executives' commitment to its principles. Research limitations/implications: Research found fewer in-depth articles on the topic than might be expected, particularly articles providing or examining hard data. Practical implications: For those seeking to develop, sustain or evaluate a corporate social responsibility program, this article offers context, insight, and caution. Originality/value: The article suggests there is resilience to corporate social responsibility, in light of the durability it has shown in the current economic downturn. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cause marketing; Citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Economic cycles; Economic sustainability",,"Strugatch, W.; Imagequest Communications, Stony Brook, NY, United States; email: warren@iqconline.com",,,02621711,,,,"English","J.

Second, the study examines whether ethical corporate behavior is associated with a marketvalue premium. Results of prior studies are mixed. The results of our study contribute directly to the recent accounting literature in which specific aspects of ethical corporate behavior have been explored (Fukami et al. 1997; Ittner and Larker, 1998; Ballou et al., 2003; Clarkson et al., 2004). We use firms listed by Business Ethics as ""The 100 Best Corporate Citizens"" as our sample of ethical firms. The univariate results of our study indicate a significant relationship between ethical corporate behavior and financial performance (i.e., greater profitability and efficiency, and lower cost of capital). The results of multivariate tests, controlling for prior year market value of equity, yield results that indicate a marginally significant association between being recognized as ethical in that year and market value of equity, but no association between being recognized as ethical at least one time and market value of equity. Nevertheless, given our study's findings of better financial performance and lower risk, we conclude that ethical corporate citizenship does indeed benefit a firm. © Copyright 2011 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accounting ethics; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",15740765,,,,"English","Res.

The authors analyze different definitions of corporate social responsibility, review chronological development of this concept and reveal similarities between different definitions. Positive and negative positions towards corporate social responsibility are presented and compared.The second part of this article reveals the theoretical concept of corporate image and the constituting factors. After discussing different definitions of corporate image, concluding remarks are made. The authors of this article discuss the topicality of corporate image management subsequently and name the factors that form corporate image, laying out the basis to manage particular factors.The first two parts of this paper provide a theoretical basis for further discussion. The third part of this article outlines insights for causality between corporate social responsibility and corporate image as well as links between the two. Concluding the reviewed literature and the newest empirical data, it is noted that corporate social responsibility has positive impact on corporate image. Positive impact can be seen through various phenomena: positive consumer attitude, positive word of mouth, etc.Theoretical studies lay the basis for creating a structural model of corporate social responsibility impact on corporate image, which presents the impact corporate social responsibility has on corporate image. In addition to previously discussed theoretical concepts, three factors forming corporate image (corporate marketing communications, corporate social responsibility and consumer demographic characteristics) are detailed. Structural model is based on LeBlanc (1995), van Riel, Balmer (1997) and Chattananon, Lawley (2007) models. Newly proposed structural model links earlier models into one single system.The new structural model is thoroughly examined using empirical research and the importance of each constituting factor is defined. The results of the empirical research reveals that corporate social responsibility has positive impact on corporate image though it is not the most important factor. Surprisingly none of demographic characteristics determines consumer attitude towards corporate image. The results of empirical research and literature studies allow to draw the conclusions and raise proposals. © 2011 Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

In a recent contribution to the Journal of Business Ethics, Brian Schaefer goes so far as to suggest that a proponent of shareholder theory cannot coherently and consistently embrace any moral position other than philosophical libertarianism. The view that managers have a fiduciary obligation to advance the interests of shareholders exclusively is depicted as fundamentally incompatible with the acknowledgement of natural positive duties - duties to aid others that have not been acquired by some prior commitment or transaction. I argue that Schaefer is mistaken. Positive duties are incompatible with the shareholder model only if we must contribute to their fulfilment in the corporate context; only if we have some reason to think that it is not possible or not permissible to discharge these obligations entirely in our private lives or through our various other roles and capacities. But we have no good reason to accept this. I argue that individuals are presumptively free to decide how and when to discharge their positive duties, and that buying shares does not cause this presumption to lapse. Hence a non-libertarian moral theory can be held without incoherence by a proponent of the shareholder model. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","aid; corporate social responsibility; libertarianism; positive duties; shareholder theory",,"Dobos, N.; Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; email: Ned.Dobos@anu.edu.au",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

This paper aims to examine the influence of CSR on the buying behaviour of Malaysian consumers and whether they consider a corporation's CSR initiatives before making any purchase decisions of the products and services.

However, CSR is poorly defined and little is known about the mechanisms by which this response occurs. This paper seeks to understand how consumers define CSR and how it can enhance the overall value proposition for consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The value typology developed by Sheth et al. is integrated with qualitative data to enhance understanding of these value paths. Interviews were conducted with consumers through the heart of the current recession, when consumers were particularly aware of value when making purchase decisions. Findings: The way in which CSR manifests itself determines consumer support. CSR can provide three forms of value to consumers: emotional, social, and functional. Each of these enhances or diminishes the overall value proposition for consumers. Further, value created by one form of CSR can either enhance or diminish other product attributes. Practical implications: The current research helps managers understand how CSR can create value for consumers. As a result, managers can better position products in order to enhance overall value. Further, practitioners can match the value with which consumers identify from CSR to the dominant value driver in their product category.

Further, the perception of these notions can differ in the small-business world from the original academic definitions. This article focuses on the cognition of small-business owner-managers. Given the impact of small-business owner-managers on their ventures, corporate responsibility and ethical issues can take a different route in SMEs. The small-business owner-manager is able to shape the corporate culture and to enact values other than profit. Adopting a cognitive perspective, we have identified how the small-business owner-manager makes sense of notions linked to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business ethics. The concept of sensemaking has recently been applied to CSR (Basu and Pallazzo, 2008; Cramer et al., 2006). Applying a cognitive perspective to small-business owners may help in explaining specific phenomena found within small-business ownership. For this research, the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) is used, a method that has not previously been widely applied in the business and society field. Our findings to an extent invalidate the confusion in terminology found in the academic literature. Small-business owner-managers, pragmatically and rather clearly, differentiate among the various concepts related to corporate responsibility and business ethics but, at the same time, they recognise the interrelationships and interdependencies of these concepts. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how small-business owners think and integrate corporate responsibility and ethical issues into their decision-making. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; cognition; corporate governance; corporate social respon- sibility; entrepreneur; family business; perception; Repertory Grid Technique; sensemaking; small business; SME",,"Fassin, Y.; Ghent University, Vlerick Leuven Gent Management School, Ghent, Belgium; email: y.fassin@skynet.be",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

Using a sample of 59 firms ranked in the top 100 of Australian and UK firms, we find that firms making voluntary corporate social responsibility disclosure in compliance with the Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines are associated with an increased cost of equity capital. Our main results are robust to several alternative measures of voluntary corporate social responsibility disclosure. These results can be attributed to two reasons. Firstly, firms making voluntary corporate social responsibility disclosure provide information that allows certain traders to make judgments about a firm's performance that are superior to the judgments of other traders. As a result, there may be more information asymmetry amongst traders. Secondly, shareholders consider that the information production and proprietary costs associated with voluntary corporate social responsibility disclosure outweighs its potential benefits. Both explanations suggest that investors will impose a higher cost of equity on firms making voluntary corporate social responsibility disclosure. In the additional tests, we show that our main results are robust to alternative measures of voluntary corporate social responsibility disclosure.","Capital; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Disclosure",,"de Villiers, C.; The University of AucklandAustralia; email: c.devilliers@auckland.ac.nz",,"Virtus Interpress",17279232,,,,"English","Corp.

This could be attributed to stakeholder concerns of ethical practices of companies globally. This study focuses on how an indigenous Ghanaian bank reports its CSR activities online and in the annual reports. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework was adopted from the extant literature and used as the basis of comparative content analysis of social responsibility data on CAL Bank's website, www.calbank.net and the annual reports. We compared the social responsibility reportage on the website with the social responsibility reportage from the annual reports of the Bank from 2003-2009. We also conducted in-depth interviews with senior management of the bank to develop a deeper understanding of CAL Bank's online CSR reportage. Findings: There seems to be a consistency between the annual reports and the corporate website CSR reportage of the bank. There however seems to be under-reportage of CAL Bank's CSR activity online as their CSR online reportage focuses mainly on external disclosures. It also came to light that the bank's CSR reportage is fragmented and is not integrated into a marketing communication plan. These findings demonstrate the challenges the bank faces in coordinating and integrating its marketing communication activities. Originality/value: Studies on online CSR communications within developing countries context is limited. This study does not only help bridge the gap but contributes to improving bank marketing practices in Ghana as well.","CAL Bank; Communications; Corporate social responsibility; Ghana; Internet; Online reportage",,"Hinson, R.; Dept. of Marketing and Customer Management, University of Ghana Business School, P.

This study aims to compare the effect of CRS and CRM on customer attitude. Design/methodology/approach: In order to overcome various measurement problems, an experiment is conducted in a country characterized by a significant diversity of attitudes towards a cause. Findings: The result indicates that both CSR and CRM have similar positive effects on customers' attitudes. However, while CRM might be more cost-efficient, its positive effect is limited to customers with high cause affinity. In contrast, CRM has a negative effect on customers with low cause affinity, or who oppose the cause. A major finding is that CRM can compensate for negative CSR to a high degree in the cause affinity segment of the market. Therefore, a high degree of cause specificity of CSR might only be preferable if the market is characterized by broad cause affinity, or if a firm is facing negative public sentiment caused, for instance, by a product harm crisis.

Nevertheless, it has not been established whether the impact of restatement extends to the domain of voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures. To address this question, we compare firms CSR scores and the association between executives' compensation and firms CSR scores before and after restatement. We use a sample of 44 U.S. firms in the two-year period before and after a financial restatement announcement. In firms that had undergone restatement, we found a significant increase in CSR strengths and CSR weaknesses that resulted in a net decrease in total CSR. In addition, we found a stronger association between bonus and CSR after restatement. This contributes by furthering our understanding by suggesting that voluntary CSR disclosures are indirectly impacted by restatement. Our findings are useful in understanding the pervasiveness of restatement on a firm's disclosures and operations and also in gaining insight into the comparability of CSR disclosures after restatement. © Copyright 2011 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CEO compensation; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Restatements",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",15740765,,,,"English","Res.

Of 41 airlines, only 14 had annual CSR reports publically available in January 2009. Reports were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Results showed a stronger focus on environmental issues than on the social or economic dimensions of CSR. Of the seven major environmental themes examined, emission reduction programs predominate. Other environmental issues receive much less attention, with no single other initiative implemented by all airlines. Four social and environmental themes were found, including employee wellbeing and engagement, diversity and social equity, community wellbeing and economic prosperity. The data analysis supported the arguments made in the literature that the airlines report CSR initiatives using differing or inconsistent measurements, making evaluation and comparison of their performance and effectiveness difficult. Although a large number of airlines publishing CSR reports discussed their achievement of major goals (reduction of emissions, increasing community involvement or increasing workforce diversity), a much smaller number provided detailed information relating to specific initiatives implemented in order to contribute to these goals. Further, important issues for CSR research are posed in the paper. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Air travel; Airlines; Corporate social responsibility; Reporting; Sustainability","air transportation; airline industry; emission control; environmental issue; industrial policy; industrial practice; policy implementation; qualitative analysis; sustainability","de Grosbois, D.; Department of Tourism and Environment, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada; email: ddegrosbois@brocku.ca",,,09669582,,,,"English","J.

This new vision extends and surpasses the traditional dyadic buyer-supplier relationship that has historically dominated the field leading to a new global supply chain dynamic. The case of the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris is used to question the ability of a hub firm to ensure component traceability from first-tier and second-tier suppliers and thus consolidate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Indeed, second-tier supplier failure to comply with CSR requirements, even if the first-tier suppliers meet these requirements, may damage customer perception of the hub firm's strategic positioning. This research mobilizes the agency theory conceptual framework to illustrate that hub firms tend to trust first-tier suppliers with verifying CSR requirements in the upstream supply chain to reduce direct agency costs (monitoring and bonding expenditures). If this approach becomes widespread, it is highly likely that CSR expansion along the global supply chain will be ineffective.","agency theory; corporate social responsibility; purchasing roles; supply chain; sustainable development; traceability",,"Merminod, N.; Grenoble University, Domaine Universitaire, IAE de Grenoble, B.P. 47, 38040 Grenoble Cedex, France",,"Wageningen Academic Publishers",15691829,,,,"English","J.

Despite the growing body of research focussing on CSR in developing countries, there is dearth research on CSR institutionalisation in African countries. Drawing on institutional theory (IT), this article examines the focus and form of CSR practice of companies in Kenya. It is evident from our findings that the nature and orientation of CSR differ across companies with operations only in Kenya and those headquartered abroad or with international operations. Significantly, firm-related drivers such as public relations and performance, as well as global institutional pressures explain the focus and form of CSR in Kenya. This article concludes that for the institutionalisation of CSR in Kenya, attention must be paid to conditions that stifle CSR uptake such as lack of government regulations, and the government's capacity and commitment to enforce regulation.

Sustainable business success requires sustained existence in a corporation's political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental contexts. Far beyond the traditional economic focus, consumers, governments and public interest groups alike increasingly expect the business sector to take on more social and environmental responsibilities. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the model in which economic, social and environmental responsibilities are fulfilled simultaneously. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence that demonstrates genuine widespread adoption of CSR in practice, and its underlying reasons. Though research in CSR has been rapidly growing, its commercial reality and implications need to be further improved if it is to inspire corporations to voluntarily adopt CSR. In the literature, Carroll's four-dimensional (economic, legal, ethical and discretionary) CSR framework offers a theoretical basis for developing an empirically based model to explain why and how profit-motivated managers take up CSR voluntarily. Our study has developed a structural equation model to identify the key factors and their interactions that influence economically motivated managers to take on voluntary CSR, and validate Carroll's four-dimensional construct. The results support Carroll's four-dimensional CSR framework, with the exception of the link pertaining to the relationship between economic and discretionary/voluntary responsibility. This characterises the economic reality that financial market-driven economic responsibility does not automatically translate into social responsibility. Nevertheless, the empirical results demonstrate that corporations can be led to engage in more voluntary CSR activities to achieve social good when appropriate legal and ethical controls are in place. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carroll; corporate social responsibility; discretionary; economic; ethical; legal; sustainability; voluntary",,"Shum, P.

The article then discusses why frame analysis offers such a potentially rich approach to analyzing public relations controversies like this one. The Analysis section of the article examines how an anti-Nike coalition initially succeeded in imposing negative frames on two CSR issues and how this framing generated highly negative media coverage.

Only recently, a few papers have emerged on the issue.

The core message was that the primary responsibility of those running a business was to the owners or investors of the company. At the same time, Friedman assumed that the company would abide by laws and prevailing ethical customs. Unfortunately, Friedman's arguments have been misinterpreted by business managers and have provided justifications for engaging in any and all types of immoral, unethical, and illegal activities for personal gain and corporate greed. Such activities have also contributed to the recent global recession, which has had a profound negative impact on the lives of millions of people worldwide. Given various instances of corporations' abnegation of their responsibility for the impacts of their actions, it is clear that the sole purpose of a business is not merely that of generating profits for its owners. Instead, because compassion provides the necessary equilibrium between a company's purpose and the needs of its communities, it should be the new philosophy of business. Emerging from the same paradigm as corporate social responsibility (CSR), compassion is the guiding precept that a company's positive impact on its community is primary to its generation of profits for its shareholders. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Compassion; Compassionate companies; Corporate social responsibility (csr); Family and community development; Freedom; Global social ills; Human rights; Milton friedman; Philosophy of business; Responsibility to humanity; Social responsibility",,"Bejou, D.; School of Business and Economics, Elizabeth City State University, Williams Hall, 1704 Weeksville Road, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, United States; email: DBEJOU@MAIL.ECSU.EDU",,,15332667,,,,"English","J.

For a stadium development to contribute positively to the area in which it is built and maximize the benefits for a range of stakeholder groups, it is important that a stakeholder management strategy is implemented consisting of two key components: stakeholder engagement and stakeholder participation. This article presents a case study of the stakeholder management strategy implemented by Arsenal Football Club during the development of the Emirates Stadium. Based primarily on the analysis of documentary secondary data supported by a small number of semi-structured interviews, the case study uses the theoretical literature on stakeholder management as a framework. It evaluates the extent to which the football club considered the needs and interests of different stakeholder groups during the development of the Emirates Stadium. Case study analysis shows that the stakeholder management strategy consisted of resident consultations, a communications strategy, a Stadium Liaison Committee, a Stadium Management Plan, and supporter consultations. The case study concludes by emphasizing that the stakeholder management strategy implemented by the football club, while clearly demonstrating evidence of stakeholder engagement, did not extend further with little opportunity for stakeholder participation and a lack of opportunities for involvement in decision-making processes. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Arsenal; Football; Stadium redevelopment; Stakeholder Management",,"Walters, G.; Department of Management, Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, Bloomsbury, London, WC1E 7HX, United Kingdom",,,13606719,,,,"English","Managing Leis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551519653

This raises the question of whether small businesses that do not compete against large corporations may actually behave more like 'little big firms' when it comes to CSR. The article finds that the two businesses studied are mostly driven by external pressure to improve their social responsibility. Such pressure stems partly from news reports on their activities and partly from increasing competition leading to a situation where the small businesses operating in the market scrutinise each others' activities. © 2010 The Authors.",,,"Fitjar, R.D.; International Research Institute of Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway",,,09628770,,,,"English","Bus.

Based on a study of CSR disclosures, this article contributes to the existing literature by exploring whether and how the largest IT companies embrace online privacy as a CSR. The findings indicate that only a small proportion of the companies have comprehensive privacy programs, although more than half of them voice moral or relational motives for addressing online privacy. The privacy measures they have taken are primarily compliance measures, while measures that stimulate a stakeholder dialogue are rare. Overall, a wide variety of approaches to addressing privacy was found, which suggests that no institutionalization of privacy practices has taken place as yet.

Prior work suggests that CSR offers firms insurance-like protection against negative publicity due to greater levels of goodwill with various stakeholders. Yet, we still miss an answer to the following question: How effective, if at all, is CSR in insulating firms from scrutiny compared to other important marketing measures, such as customer orientation and service quality orientation? This study develops and empirically tests a theoretical framework that demonstrates the relative impact of CSR on consumer resistance to negative information when confronted with negative information about a firm. The results demonstrate that CSR shields firms from negative information about CSR practices but not information related to firms' core service offerings. Managerially, the findings demonstrate that CSR may offer less of blanket insurance than assumed in previous research. Furthermore, results indicate that firms with a consumer base of experts should favor a focus on service quality orientation over CSR; conversely, when consumers are novices firms should focus on CSR for greater consumer resistance to negative information. © The Author(s) 2011.","consumer-firm relationships; CSR; customer orientation; negative information; service quality",,"Eisingerich, A.

Another important outcome is that the job or task appointed to PWD should not deteriorate the disability. A common guideline expressed by the participants was that jobs which critically require a certain sense or ability are not suitable for PWD who do not possess this sense or ability even with the aid of technology or by other means.

Design/methodology/approach: Three cases - the Chinese milk scandal, the beef recall, and the peanut butter scandal in the USA - are presented and contrasted. Findings: The business-society-government relationship in China sets itself apart from that in the USA, largely due to its one-party political system and the Confucian tradition. The relative lack of independent watchdogs and advocacy groups and the relative lack of independence of the media make it more difficult for irresponsible behavior by powerful corporations to be exposed in China. Further, paternal local governments can sometimes play an enabling role to companies engaged in irresponsible behavior under their protective wings. Research limitations/implications: With little extant research in the area of corporate social responsibility in the Chinese context, future research can build on this research and further test the relationship with quantitative data. Practical implications: The research provides insights into the context of business operations in China and thus has significant practical relevance.

Based on organizational ecology and organizational stages theory, the study hypothesizes that larger versus smaller companies demonstrate greater formalization and codification of their support for employee volunteering. Similarly, larger versus smaller companies use employee volunteering efforts more strategically; this finding is consistent with a need to justify decisions. These outcomes in turn impact the nature of volunteering and the organizations benefiting from such programs. Survey data from a size-stratified sample of 990 randomly selected Canadian businesses indicates that large companies support employee volunteerism in a more formalized and strategic manner than small companies. This behavior includes having formal policies and programs, as well as exercising greater influence over the causes which benefit from employee volunteering. Additionally, large companies are more likely to tie other forms of charitable support to employee volunteering.

Software tools can play an important role in mapping out the current state of PPP aspects along the production chain, and in the design and evaluation of improvement options. There are indeed many tools that are claimed to be useful for sustainability and social responsibility considerations. Yet, a tool that addresses all three aspects of value creation holistically and facilitates discussion is missing. In this paper we present the development of such a tool, called QChain. The development of this tool was based on ideas from soft systems methodology and inputs from a multidisciplinary team of experts and managers. The tool is intended to support group discussions, particularly during the early stages of innovation processes aimed at improving PPP aspects of production chains. It enables users to visualize the essential elements of the current production chain showing the current PPP values, and explore and compare possible future production chain scenarios and the corresponding PPP values. QChain's visualization helps discussants get a rich appreciation of the current and future scenarios, while the semi-quantitative 'what-if' analysis and scenario comparison enables them to hold objective discussions.","corporate social responsibility; innovation support; production chains; soft systems methodology; sustainability",,"Kassahun, A.; Department of Social Sciences, Wageningen University, Hollandseweg 1, 6706 KN, Wageningen, Netherlands",,"Wageningen Academic Publishers",15691829,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: KLD data are used to generate subsamples of environmental ""strengths"" and ""concerns"". Differences in EM are studied across subsamples, using discretionary accruals to proxy for EM. The samples consist of 2,171 US firms. Findings: Firms with at least one environmental strength do not exhibit statistically different levels of EM, relative to environmentally neutral firms, while firms with at least one environmental concern do exhibit statistically greater EM (greater income-increasing discretionary accruals), relative to other sample firms. Further, firms with multiple environmental concerns exhibit greater EM than firms with a single environmental concern. These findings do not support the political cost hypothesis per the CER/EM literature, but they do support the institutional hypothesis (in the case of environmental strengths) and myopia avoidance hypothesis (in the case of environmental concerns) per the broader corporate social responsibility (CSR)/EM literature. Research limitations/implications: The findings are limited to US firms; results may not be transferable to other countries. KLD data are binary, and thus may not capture the full array of CER. Practical implications: The findings may aid interested parties in detecting EM. Originality/value: The paper provides a new testing environment for theoretical frameworks established in the CER/EM and CSR/EM literatures.

Design/methodology/approach – A between-subjects experimental design tests the hypotheses with a generalisable sample of 165 French consumers. Findings – Environmental communication positively influences the strength and favourability of brand environmental associations, therefore improving brand equity. Two moderators reinforce the impact of environmental communication on brand equity through the strength of brand environmental associations: the perceived congruence between the brand and the cause, and the perceived credibility of the claim. Practical implications – In the context of greater consumer pressure regarding business ethics, managers should favour environmental arguments in their corporate communication to improve brand image through societal associations. Doing so, they should focus their communication on causes that are congruent with their brands to facilitate brand equity building, and ensure they are credible when proclaiming these arguments. Originality/value – Despite existing research on corporate social responsibility (CSR), no studies focus on the specific impact of CSR communication on brand equity.

We argue that where principal institutions intersect (i.e., family and business); managerial perceptions of stakeholder salience will be different and more complex than where institutions are based on a single dominant logic. We propose that (1) whereas utilitarian power is more likely in the general business case, normative power is more typical in family business stakeholder salience; (2) whereas in a general business context legitimacy is socially constructed; for family stakeholders, legitimacy is based on heredity; and (3) whereas temporality and criticality are somewhat independent in general-business urgency, they are linked in the family business case because of family ties and family-centered non-economic goals.

The analysis emphasizes that during the emerging phase of the standard, the potential lack of consensus within the constituents of the national institutional environment concerning the value of a new standard could send mixed signals to firms about the standard. The results show that in the early phase of adoption, regulative and normative forces within the institutional environment can work against each other. Results also show that regulative or coercive forces play a relatively more important role in the early phase of adoption of the standard than in the subsequent phases of diffusion. In the later phases of diffusion of ISO 14001, normative forces, such as the diffusion of other management standards, as well as factors related to trade, play a more important role. Because of the similarities between environmental management standards and corporate social responsibility standards, this study can help identify some of the challenges for diffusion of ISO management standards in the area of social responsibility. ©2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,,"Delmas, M.

DNA is used as an extended metaphor to clarify and illustrate the workings of an organization and how sustainability may be implemented. This construct includes core ideology, dynamic capabilities, and societal engagement. The firm's DNA is communicated to both internal and external stakeholders, and stakeholders' concerns should be an influence on strategic marketing planning. Performance management is the third major construct in the model and includes corporate social performance and corporate financial performance metrics.

The purpose of the paper is to clarify and compare what these panels think motivates mangers to pursue CR from a positivist and normative perspective. We find that the three panels are in surprising agreement as to what they assume motivates managers to pursue CR and what should motivate the same managers. We also see a large discrepancy between what they think motivates and what should motivate managers.

This paper seeks to frame ten effective implications/lessons of the most recent bank bailouts of 2007-2009 in the Western economy model when analyzing actual shareholders’ value retrenchment or growth opportunities. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a literature review and a re-conceptualized framework of event study methodology, secondary data analysis of qualitative and quantitative information. Findings – Recent bank bailouts relate to: global bailout interconnections, economic downturn and liquidity boost, abnormal returns, efficiency recovery, evasion of social costs, new opportunities for M&A, new risk management applications, opportunistic investors and eventually patience. Most important, findings recommend shareholders to grasp opportunities for bargains from bailout banks as well as to harvest their existing investments. At the same time, economic education and control become another important solution. Research limitations/implications – Consequently, as the paper targets most recent bailouts, a still ongoing event, there is a need for extended financial data that could enhance some cause-related solutions after economic recovery. Practical implications – The practicality of the paper refers to guiding management of both government and financial institutions on the choice for reasoning bank bailouts, providing some critical thinking views to investors as well as academics. Originality/value – Research or studies on the most recent financial crises bailouts have not yet been written, due to the process continuation. The novelty of the paper resides not in calculating ratios and interpreting them, but rather in looking more into some interesting strategic moves used to boost shareholders’ value. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Asset valuation; Bank bailout; Bank consolidation; Financial crisis; Financial management; Financial risk; M&As; Shareholders; Social corporate responsibility",,"Yiannaki, S.M.; European University Cyprus, Laureate International UniversitiesCyprus",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14502194,,,,"English","EuroMed Journal of Business",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882690676

Observations suggest that development of these practices is influenced by four learning dynamics: people's perceptions of 'shifting landscapes' in which they seek to orient themselves, exploration and both biographical and systemic reflexivity. Our interdisciplinary and empirically grounded approach, integrating psychological intentions and institutional context, strengthens theorizing about responsible careers. The proposed model depicts responsible careers as continually evolving, sometimes precarious, and as dynamically enacted in relation to pluralist, shifting landscapes. © 2011 The Author(s).","Business in society; Careers; Charities/not-for-profit organizations; Interdisciplinary; Learning; Reflexivity; Responsibility; Social change; Sustainability",,"Tams, S.; School of Management, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom; email: s.tams@bath.ac.uk",,,00187267,,,,"English","Hum.
