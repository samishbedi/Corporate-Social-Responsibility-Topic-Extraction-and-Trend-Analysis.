Despite extensive studies on CSR activities in Malaysia, studies that investigated the nature of CSR activities in relation to firm financial performance still limited. Thus, this research investigates the relationship between CSR activities and firm financial performance of Malaysian public listed companies. This study relied on secondary data obtained through content analysis of published company's annual reports for the year 2009-2013. Based on purposive sampling method, this study covered the assessment of the top one hundred companies in Malaysia whose names and shares were quoted in Malaysia stock exchange (Bursa Malaysia). Based on literature, four independent variables (environment, community, workplace and marketplace) and two dependent variables (Earning Per Share (EPS) and Return on Equity (ROE)) have been chosen in this study. Data were analyzed and interpreted using SPSS specifically Pearson's correlation to analyses the relationship between CSR activities and firm financial performance. This study discovered that most of the relationship between four CSR activities (environmental, community, marketplace and workplace) with financial performance (ROA and ROE) were positive. It can be concluded that Malaysian top 100 companies that actively involved in the four CSR activities are able to enhance their financial performance. It is imply that sound financial management can effectively be achieved through appropriate CSR practice that leads to a considerable economic development. Companies' performance would improve by adopting this appropriate recommendation for enhancing good CSR practice. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","Appropriate; Assessment; Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance; Malaysian listed companies",,"Yusoff, W.F.W.; Faculty of Technology Management and Business, University Tun Hussein Onn MalaysiaMalaysia",,"Medwell Journals",19935250,,,,"English","Int.

However, only few previous studies address project-level communication process in construction, in particular, from a project management perspective. This research aimed to explore how construction project teams manage different stages of project communication process as identified in the project management bodies of knowledge, namely stakeholder identification, communication planning, information distribution, stakeholder management and performance reporting. The case study research method was used to investigate the research problem. Three construction projects in Sri Lanka were chosen for the study. Semi-structured interviews with top management who represented each key party (client, consultant and contractor) were undertaken within the selected cases. The findings revealed how project communication process was managed by the project team by use of various project management tools and techniques during the five key stages.

Academic research has explored how varying attributes of markets, industry sectors and firms might shape corporate social and financial performance, but includes little effort to examine the impacts of different kinds of CRA on corporate performance. We build on debate about the value of firms' reporting activities related to corporate responsibility. Recent literature suggests that CRA-R is superficial marketing or ""greenwashing."" Despite this viewpoint, corporate reporting activities related to responsibility are rising. In order to solve this puzzle, this article explores the impact of CRA-R on corporate performance. First, drawing from the institutional perspective, we propose that CRA-R will positively impact corporate social performance (CSP) oriented toward secondary stakeholders. Second, combining the stakeholder-agency perspective and corporate responsibility literature, we motivate the hypotheses that CRA-R positively influences corporate financial performance (CFP). Empirical testing with a unique dataset of large US corporations selected in the Fortune 500 support the proposed hypotheses. In particular, both corporate social responsibility and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) activities positively influence corporate environmental performance, and financial performance. In particular, GRI reporting is a strong indicator to impact both social and financial performance.

Studies have also found interesting results in respect of the effect of cultural differences and gender on the effectiveness of business ethics instruction. While not the primary focus of this study, we also looked at the influence of gender and culture on students’ responses. Our results indicate significant differences in respect of mode of delivery and culture. In contrast to other studies, we found that gender was not significant. We did test for any interactive effects of gender, culture and mode of delivery. However, no significant differences were found. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Culture; Ethics; Gender; Mode of delivery; Nationality; Teaching; Undergraduates",,"McGuire, L.M.; Department of Management, Monash UniversityAustralia; email: linda.mcguire@monash.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Overall, our results reveal that before confiscation LMFs engage more in LTAV than lawful firms do, whereas after confiscation there is no significant difference between both types of firm. Furthermore, we find that several factors have a significant influence on the probability of engaging in such a practice. This study can enhance further research on the effectiveness of our measures and on the determinants of LTAV in other contexts and for other types of firms. Moreover, these measures can be added to the other direct and indirect methods commonly employed to measure and detect undeclared work representing a primary means of LTAV. Finally, our study allows inferring conclusions on the relation between corporate social responsibility and tax avoidance, suggesting that socially irresponsible firms, such as LMFs, are more likely to adopt this practice. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Labor tax avoidance; Legally registered Mafia firms; Real activities manipulation; Tax avoidance; Tax evasion; Undeclared work",,"Ravenda, D.; Facultat d’Economia i Empresa, Universitat de Barcelona, Av.

The strength of the influence of these corporate level strategies is contingent on the moral character of the firm. Unrelated diversification provides opportunity for financial innovation within the firm’s internal capital market, which can result in fraudulent reporting. This is more likely when the moral character of the firm is driven by a conscienceless financial self-interest motive, as implied by the firm’s contempt toward the larger community (in terms of damage inflicted on the interests of people outside the firm). In contrast, related diversification, where product divisions focus on mutual sharing and monitoring of operational activities, can reduce the probability of fraudulent reporting. This is more likely when constituents within the firm view themselves as moral citizens, as implied by the firm’s benevolence toward the larger community. Hence, while unrelated diversification focuses the energies of managers within the firm on financial manipulation, related diversification focuses these energies on productive purposes. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agency theory; Community; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Fraudulent reporting; Related diversification; Stakeholder theory; Sustainability; Unrelated diversification",,"Chakrabarty, S.; Department of Management, College of Business Administration, University of Nebraska - LincolnUnited States; email: chakrabarty@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",01674544,,,,"English","J.

This raises important ethical and social justice issues, as does the finite nature of mineral resources, which can mean that current generations enjoy the benefits of mining while future generations bear the costs of environmental and social impacts that can continue long after mining ends. During recent decades two broad approaches, voluntary industry initiatives and government regulation, have been employed in attempts to achieve a more equitable distribution of mining’s positive and negative effects. Both have serious drawbacks. Industry initiatives are ultimately voluntary and may be abandoned in tough economic times; they can be highly variable across companies and projects; and they suffer from serious compliance issues. Public regulation can be inflexible, is subject to industry capture, and in many major mineral producing nations a ‘retreat from regulation’ is reducing its relevance. This article considers whether, and under what conditions, a third and emergent instrument, community development agreements (CDAs), can help overcome the shortcomings associated with industry initiatives and public regulation. It argues that CDAs have considerable potential in this regard, but that communities can encounter significant practical challenges in their negotiation and implementation. In addition, disparities in negotiation power between communities and project developers can result in inequitable agreements, indicating a continued need for government involvement to create a more level ‘negotiation terrain’. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Community development agreements; Corporate social responsibility; Mining industry; Public regulation; Social justice",,"O’Faircheallaigh, C.; School of Government and International Relations, Griffith UniversityAustralia; email: ciaran.ofaircheallaigh@griffith.edu.au",,"Springer Netherlands",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Yet the influence of religion on managers’ environmental decisions has until now remained unexamined despite its known importance. In this article, we examine the empirical association between religion—primarily Christianity—and the environmental practices a firm’s management undertakes by investigating their OLS, principal component, simultaneous, and endogenous effects. Employing a large and extensive U.S. sample, we find a negative association between the environmental practices initiated by a firm’s managers and the religiosity of the surrounding community, after controlling for various firm and demographic characteristics. In addition, after mitigating endogeneity with the dynamic system generalized method of moment, we still find an inverse association between religiosity and environmental-friendly decisions of management. We interpret these results as providing some support for the “dominion hypothesis” that claims Christian beliefs discourage environmental concern, but not for the “stewardship hypothesis” that implies that Christianity encourages people to “exercise a responsible stewardship over nature.” Nevertheless, additional analysis shows Christian groups differ significantly in how each influences managers’ environmental decisions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Christianity; Dominion; Environment; Lynn White; Religiosity; Stewardship",,"Jo, H.; Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, United States; email: hjo@scu.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Visioning, the process of constructing desirable future states, can provide direction for sustainability-oriented planning and decision-making and is increasingly used in this capacity. However, there is ample evidence that urban visions are often not designed along a robust set of sustainability principles. We analyze nine explicitly sustainability-related urban visions from Sweden, Germany, Ireland, Canada, USA, and Australia with respect to their sustainability substance, i.e. in how far they, broadly and in detail, adhere to sustainability principles. Using rough set analysis, we identify a number of procedural components that enable or obstruct the inclusion of sustainability substance in urban visions. Results indicate that the sampled urban visions do not substantially and comprehensively include sustainability substance, instead narrowly focus on optimizing the built environment, for example. Furthermore, the sustainability substance of visioning processes benefits from stakeholder engagement that includes capacity building, whereas some other types of participation obstruct the inclusion of sustainability substance. The study concludes with recommendations for visioning processes to yield urban visions with sustainability substance inclusive of a diverse and integrated set of sustainability principles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Resilience thinking; Rough set analysis; Urban sustainability; Urban visions; Visioning","capacity building; decision making; stakeholder; sustainability; urban area; urban planning; Australia; Canada; Germany; Ireland; Sweden; United States","John, B.; Leuphana University Lüneburg, Faculty of Sustainability, Scharnhorststr. 1, Germany",,"Elsevier Ltd",02642751,,,,"English","Cities",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934983992

But small regions - where private and public sector decision makers take actions whose aggregated effects shape those broader pathways - are faced with the need to adapt to climate impacts over which they have little control. Such impacts already include not only direct climatological ones, but also related systemic shifts in technologies, markets, and policies. Firms and policymakers can widen the range of adaptation opportunities by exploring regional resources applicable to emergent clusters, through which technologically related inter-organizational dynamics may permit more effective climate responses. As in the resource-based view of the firm underlying cluster theory, key decision fields are chosen based on existing capabilities internal to the region in relation to the threats and opportunities transmitted by external climate change impacts. Adaptive strategy options at the regional level can be identified and assessed using a scenario-building methodology that incorporates the interactions among multiple variables and decision-makers' actions over time. Stakeholder input and engagement during the research process can facilitate realism and traction.

The main hypothesis is that there are two major types of banking institutions: conventional banks and ethical banks. Each has a distinct business model. To test how they have reacted to the new environment, factor analysis techniques have been used. The main findings are twofold. Firstly, the new financial context has indeed caused the behavior of mainstream banks to change. Within this group, one can further distinguish between those that have tried to anticipate the changes by adopting a more responsible financial attitude and those that have merely modified their banking practice to comply with the new regulatory framework. Secondly, there are the so-called ethical banks. Interestingly, their behavior has scarcely been altered by the new financial context. The main conclusion is that the different response of both types of banks reflects the existence of a distinct business model. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Commercial banks; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Ethical banks; Green-washing; Principal component analysis",,"Paulet, E.; ICN Business School, 13 Rue Michel Ney, C075, France",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Creation of customer loyalty is a challenge for service firms because switching service firms can represent a risk. The purpose of this paper is to examine how wealth managers select and implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) and service innovation strategies to influence customer loyalty. Design/methodology/approach – A review of the related literature indicated that scant studies have determined the meanings and outcomes of CSR and service innovation. Therefore, the roles of CSR and innovation were examined in this study to evaluate how these factors affect customer loyalty in a wealth management context. The authors evaluated customer advocacy, relationship quality, and relationship value as mediating variables, and formulated six hypotheses. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey distributed to wealth management customers in Taiwan. All the hypotheses were verified using a structural equation model and data collected from the respondents. Findings – The results indicated that relationship quality and value are positively related to customer loyalty, and customer advocacy is positively related to both relationship quality and value. In addition, CSR and service innovation are positively related to customer advocacy. Research limitations/implications – This research was limited to collecting data related to specific service providers, and therefore consumers in other countries should be examined to test the robustness of the theoretical model. The results of analyses conducted on other industries and in other countries might differ. Practical implications – In the wealth management service context, CSR and service innovation capabilities contribute to customer advocacy, which can achieve superior relationship quality, relationship value, and customer loyalty.

Collectively, these expectations and needs form a multi-faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management research has largely focused on monitoring as a self-managed set of narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to align with stakeholders' expectations and leverage accountability to stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a model that proposes how firms might address accountability for sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct of sustainable evaluation and verification (SEV) captures three interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality, reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is validated. Also, several antecedents of SEV systems are explored. Finally, the means by which an SEV system can create a competitive advantage are investigated. © 2015 The Authors.","Inclusivity; Monitoring; Social responsibility; Stakeholder engagement","Competition; Monitoring; Supply chain management; Competitive advantage; Extended supply chains; Inclusivity; Social responsibilities; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability issues; Sustainable evaluations; Sustainable supply chains; Economic and social effects","Vachon, S.; Western University, Ivey Business SchoolCanada",,"Elsevier",02726963,,JOTME,,"English","J Oper Manage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938303744

The theory postulates a set of technologies and practices that are unique to each wave. Although a challenge of the Kondratieff wave theory is great variance in interpretations about the timing of the waves among scholars, based on several analyses we suggest that with the financial crisis of 2008, and resulting economic instability, we are experiencing the end of the fifth wave and the emergence of the sixth. We take as our starting point the global trends, particularly those of scarcity and the rising cost of commodities such as energy and raw materials that have led to a widely shared hypothesis that resource productivity will be the key driver of technology and economic growth in the next wave. Socially, this driver will be fortified by growing environmental concerns since climate change and the destruction of natural ecosystems seem inevitably to proceed. Both these sources are boosting a generation of new companies and behaviour. In this article our focus is to evaluate weak signals that point to possible directions for the future of organisational practices in the sixth Kondratieff wave. We ask what will be the effects of the changing socio-technical landscape on the working life and organisational culture. The K-waves theory explains how certain ways of organising that have so far developed in the fringes of organisational culture may move into the mainstream, as a product of the systemic restructuring that has often accompanied the new K-wave. We present our findings from a workshop with representatives of five different resource efficiency oriented organisations in the Silicon Valley area. Based on the data we have gathered through the workshop and complementing interviews, we show how organisations base their considerations about the future to a surprisingly large extent on ethical arguments. Our material also includes a case that shows that this ethical approach is not self-evidently related to the aim for resource efficiency. We evaluate our results in the Future Sign - framework presented by Hiltunen. The signals we have gathered are combined with corporate shared value - thinking, and both are interpreted through the Kondratieff - wave theory. Based on our sample of five cases, along with a framework that supports our interpretation, we suggest the ethical motivations as backbone of organisations is a relatively strong future sign that has potential for strengthening in the sixth wave context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethics; Future sign; Kondratieff waves; Resource efficiency; Sixth wave; Social change","economic growth; economic instability; economic theory; ethics; future prospect; socioeconomic conditions; technological development; theoretical study","Kurki, S.; Finland Futures Research Centre, University of Turku, Korkeavuorenkatu 25 A 2, Finland",,"Elsevier Ltd",00163287,,,,"English","Futures",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940460694

Although scholars have analyzed the various dimensions of CSR, the employers’ agency toward CSR, and its impacts on employees’ work attitude, both psychosocial variables and the ability to engage the entire organization in behaving socially responsibly have remained relatively unexplored. Based on the Social Identity Theory framework, the main purpose of this study was to validate a theoretical model of the relationships of influence between CSR, organizational sense of community and business professionals’ commitment. We hypothesized that CSR influences organizational commitment through the mediational impact of organizational sense of community; furthermore, we hypothesized that this indirect relationship would be greater than the direct relationship between CSR and organizational commitment. Moreover, we expected that the linkages between the variables of the psychosocial CSR-based model would be stronger for employers than for employees. To test our hypotheses, 345 business professionals—employers as well as employees who worked in southern Italian SMEs—filled out a questionnaire that included several scales of psychosocial CSR, organizational sense of community and organizational commitment. Structural Equation Modeling analysis confirmed our main hypotheses. Such a psychosocial model allowed us to note some relevant theoretical issues concerning CSR and practical implications that could support human resource management to enhance business professionals’ engagement in corporate socially responsible activities in SMEs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Corporate social responsibility; Organizational commitment; Organizational sense of community; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Structural equation model",,"D’Aprile, G.; Grifo multimedia S.r.l, Via Bruno Zaccaro 17/19, Italy",,"Springer New York LLC",08927545,,,,"English","Employee Responsib.

Previous studies found that either AC or VE determinants, not both, play a major role in making philanthropy decisions. This study reveal new and interesting findings using the data from 13 publicly traded hospitality companies in Taiwan collected between 1996 and 2011. Panel regression test results show that both VE determinants (labor intensity and profitability) and AC determinants (board size and the ratio of independent directors to total directors) were found to be significant factors in explaining the discretionary behavior of CP in the hospitality industry. Furthermore, the lagged philanthropy-to-sale ratio was also significantly related to CP decisions in the hospitality industry in Taiwan, suggesting that the behavior of CP in the Taiwanese hospitality industry is persistent. The possible explanation is that changing philanthropy pattern may lead to market-adverse expectations and reactions and damage the reputation of companies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agency cost theory; Corporate philanthropy; Hospitality industry; Value enhancement theory",,"Lin, C.-P.; Department of Finance, Chang Jung Christian UniversityTaiwan",,"Elsevier Ltd",02784319,,IJHMD,,"English","Int.

Most of the big publishing houses are such MNCs and if open access repositories (OARs) are to be relevant such publishing houses will have to embrace the concept.

Research questions: In what ways did the Chinese public exercise its new power through social media in addressing the ConocoPhillips Oil Spill Incident? How did a multinational company like ConocoPhillips act during the crisis and react to the voices of the public through new media? Literature review: Social media has caused a power shift in China by allowing the ordinary Chinese public who used to be the silent majority to expose scandals and express their opinions about crises with greater freedom. At the same time, pressure is growing on corporations to exercise social responsibility, through responding to economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary expectations that society has. Stakeholder theory indicates that only by meeting the needs and expectations of the individuals and groups who can affect or are affected by the firm's objectives can a firm survive and succeed. In developing countries, corporate social responsibility is characterized by a lack of systematic and institutionalized approach, with stakeholders, such as the public and community, being neglected for a long time. Methodology: Researchers conducted a thematic analysis of 932 microblog and blog entries about the ConocoPhillips Oil Spill Incident in China that were published on leading Chinese social media websites between June 2011 to February 2013. Results and discussion: The study found that the oil spill sparked an uproar of anger and criticism in the Chinese online community. Most posts on microblogs and blogs engaged in finding the causes and laying the blame for the oil spill. The overwhelming majority of the Chinese public attributed the crisis to the faulty laws and inaction on the part of the Chinese government regulators, to ConocoPhillips, and the Chinese joint venture partner China National Offshore Oil Corporation's failure to undertake due responsibilities. In response to mounting online criticisms, ConocoPhillips exhibited little interest in engaging with the Chinese public and showed poor communication in terms of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The study's theoretical contribution lies in combining CSR and Stakeholder theory with Discourse Power theory. Practical implications to multinational corporations seeking long-term business development in the developing country contexts, such as China, are that managers need to engage in responsive listening, actively participate in online conversations, and constantly scan the social media environment to manage its relations with the general public. Particularly, firms experiencing crises can gain the public's emotional support by communicating emotion-laden messages through social media. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","China; corporate social responsibility (CSR); discourse power; environmental crisis; multinational corporations; social media","Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Internet; Oil spills; China; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); discourse power; Environmental crisis; Multi-national corporations; Social media; Social networking (online)","Feng, J.; University of International Business and EconomicsChina",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",03611434,,IEPCB,,"English","IEEE Trans Prof Commun",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930506685

However, extant studies provide mixed findings on the relationship between CSR and firm performance in emerging economies. Drawing on stakeholder theory and institutional theory, we look at CSR in China, taking a multi-dimensional view of CSR and introducing marketing competence as an important intermediate between CSR and firm performance. We also use a contingent perspective to examine the role of market environments in moderating the impact of CSR on marketing competence. The findings of an empirical study conducted in China show that marketing competence fully mediates the effects of all CSR activities on firm performance. Competitive intensity weakens the positive impact of CSR toward employees on marketing competence, while it strengthens the positive effect of CSR toward society on marketing competence. The positive relationship between CSR toward customers and marketing competence is enhanced by market turbulence.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on a field survey of 408 customers of five different banks of Pakistan, the hypothesized model is tested through partial least squares based structural equation modelling. Findings – The findings demonstrate that banking customers in Pakistan recognise CSR as a multidimensional construct that serves as a direct determinant of PSQ, trust, repurchase and word of mouth (WOM) intentions. PSQ also influences customer trust directly and positively and trust has a direct and positive impact on repurchase and WOM intentions. On the contrary, PSQ does not influence repurchase and WOM intentions directly. Its effect is mediated by customer trust. Practical implications – Contrary to the previous mixed findings reported in the literature, this research confirms the explicit contribution of CSR towards customer perceptions and intentions in the context of the banking industry. The findings suggest that banking companies should take great care over preparing their CSR initiatives and include them in their marketing plans in order to improve customer loyalty intentions. In this way, CSR can enhance PSQ and customer trust, which are two key constructs in the loyalty model proposed in this paper. Originality/value – The originality of the paper lies in the context in which the research was developed. The banking industry of Pakistan had not previously been extensively researched. The proposal for a comprehensive model that evaluates the role of customer trust is another key contribution of the paper.

Design/methodology/approach – A survey was administered to 201 poor microfinance borrowers at the bottom of the pyramid in India in a cross-sectional field study format. Multivariate regression is used to examine relationships between CSR and repurchase intention. Findings – All else being the same, CSR activities aimed at the borrowers’ communities affects repurchase intentions positively even among poor captive borrowers. Further, positive perceptions of CSR to some extent mitigate the negative impact of the dissatisfaction on repurchase intentions. Unmarried borrowers, mostly female, were more moved by CSR impressions compared to their married counterparts. Research limitations/implications – Future research could identify other aspects of demographic differences in borrowers, and capture more about attitudes toward CSR and motivations for borrowing. Longitudinal study can establish causality that cannot be inferred from this cross-sectional field study. More diverse locations and organizations would offer wider generalizability. It will be interesting to examine if poor and captive customers would care about CSR activities even when such activities are targeted at recipients unrelated to them or their communities. Originality/value – The dynamics of CSR in poor captive consumer communities are somewhat novel.

Recent debates have explored whether these initiatives represent opportunities for the “democratization” of transnational corporations, facilitating civic participation in the extension of corporate responsibility, or whether they constitute new arenas for the expansion of corporate influence and the private capture of regulatory power. In this article, we explore the political dynamics of these new governance initiatives by presenting an in-depth case study of an organization often heralded as a model MSI: the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). An effort to address global deforestation in the wake of failed efforts to agree a multilateral convention on forests at the Rio Summit (UNCED) in 1992, the FSC was launched in 1993 as a non-state regulatory experiment: a transnational MSI, administering a global eco-labeling scheme for timber and forest products. We trace the scheme’s evolution over the past two decades, showing that while the FSC has successfully facilitated multi-sectoral determination of new standards for forestry, it has nevertheless failed to transform commercial forestry practices or stem the tide of tropical deforestation. Applying a neo-Gramscian analysis to the organizational evolution of the FSC, we examine how broader market forces and resource imbalances between non-governmental and market actors can serve to limit the effectiveness of MSIs in the current neo-liberal environment. This presents dilemmas for NGOs which can lead to their defection, ultimately undermining the organizational legitimacy of MSIs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Civic regulation; CSR; Deliberative democracy; Eco-labeling; Environment; Forests; Global governance; Gramsci; Multi-stakeholder initiatives; Non-governmental organizations; Transnational politics",,"Moog, S.; Essex Business School, University of EssexUnited Kingdom",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

We further evaluate how firm governance mediates the effect of family ownership on environmental and social improvements and how national governance systems influence the response of family holdings to ESG. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 23,902 firm-year observations drawn from 2002 to 2012 covering 46 countries and 3,893 firms, our findings show that both closely held equity and family ownership are negatively associated with ESG performance. When we control for governance, closely held equity is no longer associated with environmental and social rankings, but family ownership retains a significant negative association. These results are strong and consistent across liberal market economies (LME), whereas coordinated market economies (CME) exhibit generally weaker results and considerable diversity. Japan stands out as different from the other countries examined in depth. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results are consistent with agency relationships driving decisions concerning ESG commitment in LMEs. They also emphasize the role of institutional differences given the weak and variable association between ownership and ESG in CMEs. We show that families may be able to influence decisions, possibly through participation in management, despite normally effective governance constraints. As the impact of ownership and governance varies across economies and ownership type, this implies that both agency and governance should be evaluated in the context of the economic environment. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results offer insights to regulators and policy makers who intend to improve ESG performance. The results suggest that encouraging diversified ownership is particularly important in LMEs, that improvements in governance may benefit social and environmental performance where equity is closely held by institutions, but that governance may be less effective in the presence of family ownership. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Closely Held Equity; Corporate Governance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environment; Family Firms",,"Rodionova, T.; The University of Edinburgh Business School, 29 Buccleuch Place, United Kingdom",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09648410,,,,"English","Corp.

We examined the relationship between four dimensions of CSR (i.e., economic, legal, ethical, philanthropic) and purchase intention and hypothesised that basic responsibilities such as economic and legal responsibility affected purchase intention directly, while high-level responsibilities such as ethical and philanthropic responsibility affected purchase intention through the mediation of self-congruity. The results of our online survey supported our hypotheses. This finding implies that consumers' self-concept is closely related to the higher-level CSR dimensions and less related to the basic duties of companies such as their economic and legal responsibility. We confirmed that fashion companies' ethical responsibility and philanthropic responsibility could be more influential when it was self-congruous. We found that ethical responsibility is a relatively weak dimension in influencing purchase intention compared with other CSR dimensions.

We explore the nature of stakeholder ownership and propose a conceptual framework which distills the requirements for its achievement into two themes-. project governance and engagement processes. These themes are then enacted within each stage of an exploratory scenario planning process. Project governance deals with control and transparency in decision-making. It seeks to ensure that stakeholders make key decisions on project directions, processes and outputs. Engagement is based on the paradigm of collaboration or partnership. It requires the fostering of an environment for the safe expression of difference, mutual learning and co-generation of knowledge.

Specifically, this research documents that acts of social goodwill—even when they are unrelated to the company’s core business, as in the case of charitable giving—can alter product perceptions, such that products of companies engaged in prosocial activities are perceived as performing better. More important, the data show that inferences drawn from a company’s prosocial actions are strong enough to alter the product evaluations even when consumers can directly observe and experience the product. The data further show that this effect is a function of the moral undertone of the company’s motivation for engaging in socially responsible behavior and is attenuated when consumers believe that the company’s behavior is driven by self-interest rather than by benevolence.

We adopt a Bayesian approach that enables exact inferences concerning the model's parameters and handles missing data by random imputations, thus increasing the study's reliability.

Using different social performance indicators concerning environment, community and employment activities, we found evidence that a good social performance has a negative influence on stock prices in the Italian Stock Exchange Market. This phenomenon is particularly evident if the environmental strategies of the Italian listed companies are considered. Hence, the Italian investors perceive these practices as avoidable expenses reducing shareholders’ income and companies’ value and recognize a negative market premium, in terms of lower stock prices, to socially responsible enterprises. This evidence is consistent with the peculiarities of the Italian capitalism structure, which, because of its backwardness in CSR topics and related issues, seems to be not yet mature enough to evaluate appropriately the value of these policies. © 2015 Virtus Interpress.

The authors direct attention to three major perspectives in organization studies—institutional, cultural, and cognitive—that bear on the social context and explore how these perspectives are used in CSR research. These perspectives are framed as representative of the levels at which CSR may be analyzed, and each perspective is associated with a certain level of social context: the institutional perspective relates to the external social context, the cultural perspective relates to the organizational level, and the cognitive perspective relates to the individual level. The authors demonstrate how the CSR field can benefit by combining or integrating multiple perspectives that bear on the social context, and by engaging in more explicit multilevel analysis of the social context within which CSR practicesunfold. Three promising avenues for future CSR research are outlined: social ecology, cross-sector social partnerships, and strategy-as-practice. The authors argue that these avenues transcend levels and perspectives (even allowing for the combination of the three schools) and offer the prospect of more context-sensitive CSR research. © The Author(s) 2012.","Corporate social performance (CSP); Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Social context; Social ecology; Social partnerships",,"Athanasopoulou, A.; Said Business School, University of Oxford, Egrove Park, Kennington Road, United Kingdom",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on social network theories, the authors argue the possible relationships between the three variables. The authors conduct the study on 255 directorships in the boards of 20 listed companies in France, which participate in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 2010. Findings - The results show that director's background and nationality diversity in the board are the most relevant attributes to discerning firms with high CSR scores. However, the relationship between board interlocks and CSR is not consistent. Some explanations are reported and discussed. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to recognize the most influential variables in board composition for firms with high CSR scores, although it is based on a conceptual development and an explorative analysis. It could constitute the basis for future research which integrates modeling and multivariate analysis. Practical implications - Diversity in the board could be an effective tool to guide management for more CSR decisions. Social implications - The paper highlights the importance of diversifying the recruitment base when integrating new board members. This implies opening board networks to new profiles, in order to better meet stakeholders' expectations regarding CSR.

Employer attractiveness is becoming more important in order to win the most talented junior staff. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how corporate social performance (CSP) profiles of logistics companies influence their attractiveness for job seekers. Design/methodology/approach – In a computerized laboratory experiment, the authors provided 95 students in their final year with job offer data that include general and CSP information about the company, and the job seeker’s potential salary. The authors manipulated how the CSP information was presented and monitored the information accessed during job seekers’ decision-making processes. The authors investigated how information presentation affected choices. Findings – The vast majority of talent acquires CSP information in the pre-decision phase of the judgment, compares this information across companies, and trades off this information with the conditions of employment. The authors find that the ease of comparability of corporate social responsibility (CSR) information, expressed by meaningful indicators of CSP, increased preference for high CSP. Research limitations/implications – The study enriches existing studies of voluntary disclosure, which argue that voluntary disclosing sustainability-related information can be a tool of impression management. Practical implications – Companies with a compelling CSP should push for a broadly accepted methodology to benchmark CSP within industry-specific sectors, such as logistics services. Social implications – Potential employees demand that companies should consider their social impact on individuals and society as a whole. To remain attractive for employees companies in transport and logistics industry have to cope with a broader scope of expectations. Originality/value – The authors provide the first analysis on the relevance of CSP information for employer attractiveness in the transport and logistics industry. This research provides insights into the relevance of CSP criteria, information provision, and comparability processes from the perspective of young job seekers.

The influence and effect of EEB at the functional level, however, is under-researched. Similarly, the management of risk in the supply chain has become a practical concern for many firms. It is important that managers have a good understanding of the risks associated with supplier partnerships. This paper examines the effect of firms investment in EEB as part of corporate social responsibility in mediating the relationship between supply chain partnership (SCP) and management appreciation of the risk of partnering. We hypothesise that simply entering into a SCP does not facilitate an appreciation of the risk of partnering and may even hamper such awareness. However, such an appreciation of the risk is facilitated through CRs environmental and stakeholder management ethos. The study contributes further by separating risk into distinct relational and performance components. The results of a firm-level survey confirm the mediation effect, highlighting the value to supply chain strategy and design of investing in EEB on three fronts: building internal awareness, monitoring and sharing best practice. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","corporate responsibility; environmental and ethical behaviour; mediation; performance risk; relational risk; supplier partnerships","Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Mergers and acquisitions; Philosophical aspects; Risk management; Supply chains; Corporate responsibility; environmental and ethical behaviour; mediation; Performance risk; supplier partnerships; Environmental and ethical behaviour; Supply chain management","Gallear, D.; Brunel Business School, Brunel UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",00207543,,IJPRB,,"English","Int J Prod Res",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941939926

To ensure an applied exploration of SLO, this paper focused on the wind industry. Design/methodology/approach – Telephone interviews were conducted with 18 wind industry representatives responsible for stakeholder engagement in Australia. Questions focused upon understanding of consultation and SLO, perceptions of SLO in practice, and experiences regarding community engagement. Findings – SLO is broadly understood by the case study wind industry representatives as majority acceptance held by community and other stakeholders, although no common definition was expressed. This indicates that the concept has not transferred clearly or directly to the wind industry. Despite this, the benefits of seeking an SLO through consultative and ongoing communication practices were recognised across the wind industry as a positive risk mitigation strategy. Research limitations/implications – Future research could examine the understanding and communication approaches of SLO in other industries, cultures and geographic locations. Practical implications – It appears the wind industry intends to seek an SLO more broadly from the Australian public, beyond specific projects. This is likely to occur within the context of increased scrutiny on the performance of many industries and by the changing expectations and demands of communities. Social implications – Some wind corporations were considered to have previously conducted poor or shallow consultation, and this was perceived to have negatively affected the reputation of the wider industry. Mismanagement of expectations prior to the development phase was of particular concern to interviewees. Given this, an SLO could be put at risk by the poor or insufficient engagement and communication processes and reputation of their predecessors. Originality/value – The key contribution of this study is to inform CSR practices that seek to engage and maintain high stakeholder support through an SLO approach, where corporate communication is vital. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Corporate responsibility; Engagement; Social licence to operate; Stakeholder communication; Wind farms",,"Hall, N.L.; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)Australia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13563289,,,,"English","Corp.

Design/methodology/approach – This study tested these relationships through canonical correlation analyses. The data used were drawn from corporate HQ and 63 subsidiaries, which were publicly listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange in 2007. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used in the study. Findings – The results generally indicated that the isomorphism between the CSR practices of the HQ and those of their subsidiaries could impact both the CSP, especially the product and employee dimensions, and the CFP. No relationship was found to exist between the CSP and CFP. Originality/value – Despite extensive interest by scholars and practitioners in the subject area, relatively little is known about the management of CSR by the multinational enterprises (MNEs) (Meyer, 2004), as the literature does not systematically examine the effects that occur on employee performance following the diffusion of CSR among the MNEs subsidiaries. Extending earlier literature on CSR, by integrating the effect of the CFP, the present study focuses on the effects of isomorphism between the CSR practices of the MNEs and those of their subsidiaries on both CSP and CFP. Further, the study examined the interrelation of CSP and CFP from the perspective of international management. Given the increased interest in corporate governance matters at the international level, CSR plays a central and fundamentally important role in the corporate governance of the MNEs because of both globalization forces and the pressures exerted by stakeholders. In this context, this paper is one of the first to explore the transfer of CSR practices from the MNEs to their subsidiaries. The effect of CSR on performance is an important research question, especially for emerging markets (Ibrahim and Angelidis, 1995; Waddock and Graves, 1997; Ghazali, 2007; Johnson and Greening, 1999). Despite the importance of this issue, however, until recently, only a limited discussion has been evident in the literature on CSR in the international arena with particular reference given to the emerging economies. Studying the effects of the CSR isomorphism on the performance in Turkish context is justified in three ways. First, Turkey is the largest emerging economy in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East (Tatoglu et al., 2003, p. 7). It presents the emerging nature of the market and the transitional characteristics of the institutional environment (Cavusgil et al., 2002). Second, the drivers for CSR in Turkey, such as the other emerging markets whose institutional characteristics and economic fundamentals is similar, are exogenous and institutional rather than endogenous factors (Ararat and Gocenoglu, 2006, p. 11). Excluding the philanthropic activities, the very first manifestations of CSR were observed in the business conduct of MNEs in Turkey (Ararat and Gocenoglu, 2006, p. 11). MNEs have a dominant and leader role in Turkey for CSR practices. Finally, the subsidiaries operating in Turkey are less likely to resist the transfer of the organizational policies and practices such as human resource management policies (Sayim, 2010, 2011) and organizational culture (Ilhan, 2008). In fact, they want to even transfer the policies and practices from MNEs (Sayim 2010, 2011; Ilhan, 2008). Therefore, Turkish context provides a good case to test the effects of the CSR isomorphism on the performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance; Institutional theory; Isomorphism; Social performance; Turkey",,"Ilhan-Nas, T.; Karadeniz Technical UniversityTurkey",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",15587894,,,,"English","J.

Furthermore, we identify significant patterns of firm's behavior by means of novel statistical classification techniques and we analyze which aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility are less developed. The methodology is applied to a sample of Spanish firms. Our results show that there is a positive relationship between the firms Corporate Social Performance and their size, degree of Corporate Social Responsibility awareness and stakeholder pressure. However, Corporate Social Responsibility is not well-known in micro and small Spanish firms, which leads to a low level of implementation. © 2015, Copyright © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.","Bayesian inference; CSP; CSR; factor analysis; MCMC; Stakeholder theory",,"Salvador, M.; Departamento de Estructura e Historia Económica y Economía Pública, Universidad de Zaragoza, Gran Vía 2, Spain",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",16111699,,,,"English","J.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to understand smokers and non-smokers views of CSR activities by Indonesian tobacco companies. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from a large private university in Surabaya, Indonesia. There were 191 usable questionnaires with 91.7 per cent male and 8.3 per cent female. The number of smokers and non-smokers were evenly split, 49 per cent smokers and 51 per cent non-smokers which is slightly lower than the 67 per cent of male smokers in Indonesia. Of the 94 smokers in the sample, 69 per cent reported smoking on a daily basis. Findings – The results of this study suggest that CSR activities are able to cultivate favourable images of the tobacco companies especially for those who are currently smoking. CSR in the domain of the tobacco industry increases people’s favourable association with the company. Moreover, the findings show that consumer-company identification does not affect company evaluation (CE) and consumer sensitivity towards corporate social performance becomes a motivator which positively affects CE among smokers. Practical implications – This study has important implications for social marketing practice and research where the dominant focus remains on the downstream. In the case of smoking in Indonesia social marketing efforts directed towards mid and upstream may be more effective than downstream social marketing interventions which have to compete with global tobacco corporations. Originality/value – This is one of the first studies to explore the impact of CSR and one of the first studies to examine Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country which exhibits a very high male smoking rate. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Corporate identity; Corporate image; Social responsibility",,"Arli, D.; Department of Marketing, Griffith Business School, Griffith UniversityAustralia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02634503,,,,"English","Mark.

The differences between companies' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of the companies operating in the three countries with highest number of firms committed to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) -Spain, France and Japan- is assessed through a multidimensional HJ-Biplot technique, which is a statistical technique that provides a joint graphical representation in a low dimensional Euclidean space (usually a plane), of a multivariate data matrix. This research contributes to the existing literature providing quantitative evidence of how different country-specific social and institutional schemes influence companies' ESG performance. The main results reveal the existence of two clusters of companies behaving in different ways with regard of sustainability issues. First, Spanish and French companies exhibit similar levels of social and corporate governance performance, higher than those of Japanese firms. Second, Japanese firms seem more committed to environmental issues than Spanish and French companies. These results confirm that the different countries, with different institutional backgrounds, induce different priorities among their firms, in terms of ESG performance, even under a common commitment to the same principles of adopted CSR initiative. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate environmental; Corporate social responsibility; Institutionalism; Social and governance performance; Stakeholder engagement; United Nations Global Compact","Economic and social effects; Societies and institutions; Corporate environmental; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Institutionalism; Social and governance performance; Stakeholder engagement; United Nations; Sustainable development","Ortas, E.; Accounting and Finance Department, Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, University of Zaragoza, C Gran Vía n2, Spain",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Specifically, through a combination of Stakeholder Theory and specific concept within the Innovation Theory framework (called Social Innovation Capital), this work explores the relation between effective stakeholder management and how marketable innovation production affects a company's possibility of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. By doing so, new insights on CSR management to gain competitive advantage are provided. Design/methodology/approach - The present study analyzes the role of a firm's international presence, and the company's social commitment initiatives as drivers of the enterprise's corporate intangible assets. A company's reputation has also been considered as a control variable. To achieve this goal, the Spanish market was analyzed. Specifically, those Spanish companies who had the highest reputation in the global reputation pulse and showed the highest level of brand awareness, according to the latest report published by the Forum of Leading Spanish Brands, were considered. Findings - Findings show that companies including their stakeholders' interests in the knowledge-creation and innovation process are able to enhance their intangible assets and thus the capitalization of such knowledge. Similarly, firms with international presence have a large number of global stakeholders, which also evidences a positive relation with its intangible assets. By honoring the social contract, firms benefit from stakeholders while contributing to social welfare, creating a win-win situation. Originality/value - This study categorizes how intangible assets can be increased through stakeholder's involvement and firm's international presence. Consequently, researchers studying business strategy can incorporate these variables as key elements in strategic planning. Scholars in fields of information systems, operations management, knowledge or supply chain management can also evaluate the inclusion of corporate social responsibility into their studies to evaluate how it reflects on tangible assets, production process, supply chain management or the knowledge production life cycle.

The second objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between the dimensions of CSR disclosures and corporate financial performance (CFP) among Nigerian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach - To carry out this research, content analysis was conducted to extract CSR and financial data from annual reports of 68 companies listed on the Nigeria Stock Exchange. Financial data were cross-referenced with the NSE Factbook. CSR indexes and financial performance measures were computed for estimation of the regression analysis equation. The percentages were used to describe the nature and trend of CSR practice in Nigeria. This was followed by the hierarchical multiple regression analysis to examine the relationship between CSR and CFP. Findings - The results of the descriptive statistics show that the listed companies used CSR initiatives to communicate social performance to their stakeholders. From the regression analysis, community involvement disclosure, products and customer disclosures and human resource disclosures were found to enhance CFP. The results also reveal a negative relationship between environmental disclosure and CFP, which indicates that disclosure of environmental impact information could be value destroying in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications - The major limitation of this paper is the sample size. Also, failure of corporations to disclose CSR in the annual reports will have a material effect on these findings. Practical implications - The findings of this paper have practical implications on the management of Nigerian companies to re-think and re-strategize their CSR policies that incorporate social and economic performance to improve their CFP. Social implications - This paper has implication on stakeholders in validating the corporate citizenship of corporations based on the level of commitment and participation in CSR initiatives. Also, findings of this paper will alert the enforcement agencies on the status of CSR practices in Nigeria. Government in collaboration with private and public agencies should consider the needs for CSR framework and database to guide social and environmental reporting in the country.

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative content analysis was conducted on 22 Australian SME websites from the information media and telecommunications sector. Stakeholder theory was used as the basis for analysis. Findings - An important aspect of CSR communication is reporting the firm's relationships with stakeholders such as society/communities, ecological environment, employees, customers and suppliers. This paper provides insights into how these relationships are manifested in SME website communications. For example, three-way relationships between the firm and stakeholders were described on some websites, but few explained the impact of their CSR on stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - This study concentrated on identifying the CSR communication on websites from one industry sector in Australia. These limitations provide the basis for future research to explore and compare CSR communication on websites by SMEs from other industry sectors and countries. Practical implications - The findings offer SME owner-managers ideas on different ways they can incorporate details of stakeholder relationships in CSR website communications.

However, comparatively little scholarly attention has been paid to the link between the two. This paper examines how the different activities of corporate social responsibility affect corporate tax aggressiveness. A structural model was tested using partial least squares regression to determine whether the relationships between corporate social responsibility dimensions and tax aggressiveness are positive or negative. Based on a sample of French publicly listed firms, the results indicate that a firm's tax aggressiveness depends on the nature of its corporate social responsibility activities. Notably, the study demonstrates that greater the activity in the social dimension of corporate social responsibility, the lower the level of corporate tax aggressiveness will be, whereas high activity in the economic dimension is associated with a high level of tax aggressiveness. These results extend the prior literature concerning the relationship between corporate social responsibility and tax aggressiveness and suggest that the nature of the relationship, whether negative or positive, tends to differ across the corporate social responsibility dimensions. Overall, the study provides unique insight into the association between CSR activities and corporate tax aggressiveness. Indeed, the paper strongly supports the current literature and argues that the dimensions of corporate social responsibility should not be aggregated into a single measure because interesting and explanatory information is lost when such a method is used, especially with regard to an issue like corporate tax aggressiveness. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; PLS-SEM; Shareholders; Stakeholders; Tax aggressiveness","Economic analysis; Least squares approximations; Shareholders; Taxation; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); High activity; Partial least squares regression; Social dimensions; Stakeholders; Structural modeling; Tax aggressiveness; Economic and social effects","Staglianò, R.; Montpellier Business School, Montpellier Research in Management (MRM), 2300 Avenue des Moulins, France",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

This study aims to probe into these contractors' perception of corporate social responsibility, diagnose perception distortions (if any), and identify approaches to improving this perception. A benchmarking analysis based on the stakeholder theory is conducted against the perception of international prominent contractors (assumed to represent international best practices). A questionnaire survey is administered to evaluate corporate social responsibility perceptions of both Chinese international contractors and international prominent contractors. The results of the gap analysis validate that Chinese international contractors' perception of corporate social responsibility is distorted and incomplete. Significant perception gaps between the two categories of contractors are found, mainly due to poor health and safety management, low compliance and ethical standards, and insufficient consideration of corporate social responsibility-related aspects in business decision making and implementation on the part of the Chinese international contractors. The findings indicate that Chinese international contractors ought to pay more attention to labor protection, environmental protection and anti-corruption issues; they should improve their compliance and ethics levels in their overseas operations to effectively identify and create shared values between the corporation and the society. The findings of this study could also lead other contractors and organizations in the international construction industry to a better understanding of the Chinese construction industry and the associated sociocultural environment, which could reduce business conflicts and disputes, and lead to more effective business activities.

It reports on several governments' regulatory roles as their societal governance is intrinsically based on interdependent relationships. There are different actors and drivers who are shaping CSR communications and policies in relational frameworks. This paper mentions some of the countries that have already introduced intelligent substantive and reflexive regulations. It also shows how certain businesses are stepping in with their commitment for sustainability issues as they set their own policies and practices for laudable organisational behaviours. Very often, corporate businesses use non-governmental organisations' regulatory tools such as process and performance-oriented standards. These regulatory instruments focus on issues such as labour standards, human rights, health and safety, environmental protection, corporate governance and the like. Afterwards, this paper discusses about the relationship between governance and sustainability. It makes reference to some of the relevant European Union Expert Group recommendations for non-financial reporting and CSR audits. Relevant academic contributions are indicating that customers are expecting greater disclosures, accountability and transparency in sustainability reports. This contribution contends that the way forward is to have more proactive governments that raise the profile of CSR. It maintains that CSR communications and stakeholder engagement may bring shared value to business and society.

The aim of this study is to help companies better understand the issues around decarbonization and environmental performance by suggesting a holistic management process on which they could embark. This process comprises two crucial steps, which are (a) sustainability reporting and (b) low-carbon roadmaps. These steps are covered and further developed based on a detailed study of the UK food retail sector. This sector is relevant due to its economic and environmental importance, but most importantly it has a significant record of available environmental reports in the public domain and a large potential to influence consumers, policy makers and multiple supply chains. Sustainability reporting is assessed by analysing environmental KPIs disclosed in corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, and then these are compared against industry standards. This analysis highlights a general lack of consistency and transparency in CSR reporting of UK food retailers. Consequently, a low-carbon roadmap based on relevant KPIs and on the 'backcasting' framework is presented as a case study in order to showcase how a hypothetical UK food retailer can employ a low-carbon roadmap. The case study demonstrates that ambitious environmental targets are achievable if robust corporate action plans are followed. Furthermore, the case study indicates that capital might be misallocated in favour of highly visible environmental stores and on-site energy generation technologies, whilst more could be done by applying energy efficiency measures that have the potential to deliver substantial carbon savings. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental indicators; Roadmap; Stakeholder engagement; Supermarkets; Sustainable development",,"Caritte, V.; Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, United Kingdom",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",09644733,,,,"English","Bus.

Findings – The case study points to the existence of three managerial antecedents of a superior ability in social innovation: integrating CSR in its business strategy with a strong commitment from the top management; separating the activities concerned with the development of social innovations from the rest of the organization, following to the structural ambidexterity model; applying the principles of open innovation to the development of social innovations, by involving in particular non-profit organizations as a source of ideas for new social innovation projects and leveraging them to enable adoption of the new products and services. Originality/value – So far there is very limited knowledge on how for-profit organizations can develop a capability to manage social innovation projects. This paper provides exploratory evidence to fill this gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Ambidexterity; Banking industry; Corporate social responsibility; Open innovation; Social innovation; Stakeholder engagement",,"Maccarrone, P.; Department of Management Engineering, Politecnico di MilanoItaly",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14601060,,,,"English","Eur.

Contrary to parts of the extant literature, we do not find that corporate sustainability directly adds measurable value (e.g. a better brand image); neither does it exert coercive control over critical supplier relationships. However, corporate sustainability minimizes the downside risk of the business model. It does so by (1) creating implicit contracts that reach beyond traditional 'shareholder value', (2) transferring risk to suppliers and (3) improving leadership by motivating management and employees, and by directing their attention to critical issues. For companies, we offer the insight that corporate sustainability is a necessary complement to shareholder value, even if the relationship is not obvious at first sight. We also suggest that concerted actions of companies or a positive connotation of certification create effective control over suppliers. As to public policy, we conclude that regulators could introduce mandatory disclosure of suppliers to facilitate controls through stakeholders, or alternatively an industry-wide comply-or-explain code of conduct. We also address how regulators can take direct actions against countries with unsustainable labor policies. Last, we suggest future research topics, e.g. expanding the notion of a business model by interpreting 'adding value' as prevention of losses. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Business model; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability; CSR policies; Environmental policy; Information disclosure; Labor practices; Public policy; Risk management; Shareholder value; Stakeholder engagement; Supply chain; Sustainable development",,"Lueg, R.; Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences, Department of Economics and BusinessDenmark",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",09644733,,,,"English","Bus.

It has been assumed that all industries understand and apply the social licence to operate concept in a similar way, as previous research has tended to adopt a single-industry focus. This article is one of the first known cross-industry examinations of social licence to operate, comparing the use of this concept in four Australian energy industry contexts: mining, wind, carbon dioxide capture and storage, and geothermal. Semi-structured interviews with industry representatives were conducted to provide a comparison of views on the understanding and application of social licence to operate in these industries. The findings identified shared expectations of increasing stakeholder engagement in energy project development, and a view that a social licence to operate could guide this engagement. Yet the duration of use, the maturity of the industry, and the ways in which the industries related to the concept influenced the understanding and application of this concept. This research provides evidence of how the meaning and application of social licence to operate does vary between industries. Further exploration of community and government perspectives on social licence to operate is recommended in order to broaden the findings of this research.

To clarify what is meant by “pragmatism” as a philosophy for social and environmental accountability (SEA) research, to survey its use within this research field and to explore how a further pursuit of pragmatism may extend this research field. Design/methodology/approach – An extensive review of the SEA literature was conducted in order to determine what aspects of the philosophy of pragmatism have been used within the research. The authors organised the discussion of the literature around the pragmatist ideas of “truth” and “sensemaking”. Findings – SEA research is a heterogeneous space in which various ideas are commonly attributed to the philosophical notion of pragmatism. However, there is a tension in the literature between seeing accounting as a medium for representing social and environmental organisational activities and a pragmatist view of accountings as a way of allowing managers and stakeholder to make sense of these same activities. Research limitations/implications – A clearer development of the ideas of pragmatism may be used to redirect the focus of SEA research in a number of useful ways. Seeing accounting as a medium of sensemaking between organisations and their stakeholders allows the authors to widen the exploration of accounting not only to the production of reports but also their interpretation by users. The ideas of pragmatism also allow the authors to explore the ways stakeholders might affect change within organisations and how accounting may support this process rather than capture or limit it. Practical implications – This paper concludes by providing a set of methodological prescriptions for conducting future SEA research in a way that is inspired by pragmatism. It outlines an approach to research that focuses on users and their sensemaking and encourages an exploration of the possible ways accounting may create positive change in organisations. Originality/value – Overall, this paper refines what it means to follow pragmatism within SEA research. It will promote a clearer understanding of how we, as a research community, may engage with practice in more positive ways in order to facilitate corporate social responsibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Pragmatism; Social and environmental reporting; Stakeholder engagement",,"Baker, M.; University of SydneyAustralia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09513574,,,,"English","Account.

However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies - descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics - for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies' delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research. Finally, the limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are presented. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Application Programming Interface (API); Big data; Content analytics; Data analytics; Network analytics; Social media analytics; Supply chain management; Twitter","Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Chains; Computer systems programming; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Information management; Manufacture; Natural language processing systems; Research and development management; Risk management; Social networking (online); Content analytics; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Data analytics; Environmental standards; Social media analytics; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain risk management; Twitter; Supply chain management","Chae, B.; Department of Management, College of Business Administration, Kansas State UniversityUnited States",,"Elsevier",09255273,,IJPCE,,"English","Int J Prod Econ",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929513110

It reviews the use of a whistleblower to highlight AML irregularities rather than official reporting through the current AML compliance system. The article uses secondary data to offer a viewpoint on the HSBC issues from a money laundering and financial crime perspective. It extracts key statements from staff at HSBC and regulators, and examines how AML risk assessment was undertaken at this time and what changes need to occur in the future. It considers the implications of the current theoretical context for AML from an agency theory perspective. The main findings are that AML compliance needs to be embedded into a proactive corporate social responsibility approach, rather than relying solely on regulation to improve detection and reporting of money laundering activity. The research topic is new and therefore analysis papers and other academic writing on this topic are limited. Future research could consider the outcomes of the Swiss bank's attempts to prosecute the whistleblower and whether this would have implications for future internal reporting and whistleblowing approaches to support AML compliance. The outcomes from the research are the recommendations to the banking sector on addressing AML deficiencies, especially within the context of an evolving level of criminal sophistication towards money laundering. The article supports the argument for integrating social corporate responsibility and AML compliance in order to produce a whole bank response to financial crime. This is in contrast to the current systems that seem to be prevalent within the financial services, of profit and business being seen as separate rather than integral to regulation and control. The value of this article is the current example of the HSBC Swiss case and the focus specifically on AML compliance rather than tax evasion, which has been the media angle on the issue. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1741-3591.",,,"Naheem, M.A.; Seven FoundationSwitzerland",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",17413591,,,,"English","Int.

This chapter argues that such activities illustrate a particular notion of Baumol’s (1990) criminal entrepreneurialism where both creative and constructive compliance combine to subvert environmental regulation and its enforcement. Design/methodology/approach — This chapter employs a case study approach assessing the current corporate environmental responsibility landscape against the reality of corporate environmental offending. Its case study shows seemingly repeated environmental offending by Shell Oil against a backdrop of the company claiming to have integrated environmental monitoring and scrutiny into its operating procedures. Findings — The chapter concludes that corporate assertion of environmental credentials is itself often a form of criminal entrepreneurship where corporations embrace voluntary codes of practice and selfregulation while internally promoting the drive for success and profitability and/or avoidance of the costs of true environmental compliance deemed too high. As a result, this chapter argues that responsibility for environmental damage requires regulation to ensure corporate responsibility for environmental damage. Originality/value — The chapter employs a green criminological perspective to its analysis of corporate social responsibility and entrepreneurship.

The purpose of this paper is to provide much-needed insights into the interplay of responsible leadership, CSR practices, and organizational outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – It analyses 85 CEOs’ behaviors and their companies’ performance in a two-year database. It thereby enriches understanding of how leaders’ socially responsible decisions impact upon CSR engagement and firm performance. Findings – The results suggest that socially responsible leaders were positively related with organizational performance of return on equity (ROE). The aspects of integrity, morality, and stakeholder relationship aspects of responsible leadership are closely related to CSR. However, CSR practices were negatively related to ROA and ROE. It implies that in China CSR activities could not boost organizational performance in the short term, at least in two years. Research limitations/implications – Our research has clear limitations. First, most selected firms are renowned large corporations, state-owned, or private enterprises. Foreign-owned enterprises are excluded. Second, the evaluation of CSP is based on the content analysis of firms’ annual CSR reports. Our research has clear limitations.

Specifically, it explores the environmental activities and social engagements of a sample from the largest 200 companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through a questionnaire survey posted to 200 listed companies. Fifty-one usable responses were received. The companies were analysed based on size, ownership and geographical scale of business. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and Mann- Whitney U tests were used for hypotheses testing. Environmental Activity Percentage Score (EAPS) and Socially related Activity Percentage Score (SAPS) were calculated to measure the extent of companies' CSR engagement with regard to environmental and social activities, respectively. Findings - Social issues such as unemployment and poverty, the typical issues in developing countries, often override environmental issues. This is more prominent in Sri Lankan-owned companies than those with overseas ownership. The explanation for this may involve historical, cultural and religious elements. Overall, corporate managers in Sri Lanka are concerned with social issues. Practical implications - The findings indicate that environmental practices are not widespread in the Sri Lankan corporate sector. It appears that environmental consequences are not taken into account in formulating business strategies, especially by local companies. This finding may be of interest to the corporate sector, the Sri Lankan environmental authority, non-governmental organisations, the Sri Lankan Government and academics.

To this end, an exploratory case study was conducted and senior managers of four large New Zealand based companies were interviewed. The results reveal that sustainability values of top management, a desire to reduce risk and stakeholder management are salient motivators for SSCM adoption.

Design/methodology/approach – The analysis is based on eight case studies with data collected through in-depth interviews with senior managers of the companies representing 85 per cent of the Spanish foreign investments in Latin America. Findings – The findings tend to indicate that instrumental theories of CSR seem to apply for Western MNCs operating in EMs. CSR initiatives from these companies seem to be guided by instrumental theories, as they use these initiatives as a strategic tool to achieve economic objectives, seek a positive relation between them and their financial performance and use them to strengthen their reputation. Research limitations/implications – The results of this article resulted from an in-depth analysis of case studies with data collected from a carefully selected theoretical sample with data analysed by following well-established methods like coding, triangulation and pattern matching. This combination was designed to minimise possible concerns in these areas, and as a consequence to strengthen the research design and, therefore, the conclusions of the paper. Measures were taken to minimise possible concerns in this area. The companies were selected for theoretical, not statistical, reasons with the aim to replicate or extend emergent theories, which is one of the main objectives of the research. Practical implications – Companies are using CSR in EMs as a strategic tool to achieve economic objectives (the main principle behind instrumental theories). MNCs seek a positive relation between CSR initiatives in EMs and their financial performance (also a key principle within instrumental theories). Companies in the sample develop CSR initiatives, including those in EMs, to increase their legitimacy as part of their global reputation rather to deal with host country challenges. Finally, MNCs actively manage stakeholders to strengthen their local reputation as a means to improve financial performance. Social implications – Instrumental theories of CSR seem to apply for Western MNCs operating in EMs. These findings highlight the need to continue the study of CSR from Western MNCs in Ems, as the vast majority of academic literature relates to the characteristics of social responsibility initiatives in developed economies. Originality/value – Instrumental theories apply in a global market for MNCs; in this case, Spanish companies operating in more than 30 countries with a global strategy in CSR and similar objectives. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Instrumental theory; Latin America; Spanish companies",,"Lopez, B.; ESIC Business and Marketing SchoolSpain",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0955534X,,,,"English","Eur.

Most banks have incorporated social practices in their business operations regardless of the managers’ real intentions of whether it is for the corporate image that might lead to better performance; or it is for the well being of the environment or society overall. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to check if the concept of the CSR is widely applied to local, international and Islamic banks operating in Egypt over the interim period from 2005 to 2013 and if there is a difference in the application. Moreover does CSR really matters and affect banks' financial performance. Descriptive statistics will be used. The difference in performance will be tested for statistical significance using one way ANOVA tests. The statistical study conducted on 34 banks categorized under Local commercial, International and Islamic banks are operating in Egypt. The relationship is neutral when it is looked at from the ROA measure. The banks’ Corporate Social Responsibility did not have any impact on the financial performance of the banks. However, the relationship was positive when the financial performance perspective was looked from the estimated ROE and NIM; it implies that banks’ corporate social responsibility practices not act as costs to shareholders as they do not reduce the returns. Whether the relationship is positive or neutral, the coefficient for both models are rather small as well as the model that resulted in Neutral relationship had lower standard of error which indicates that it is a better model compared to the model using ROE and NIM as the dependent variable.

Furthermore, relying on previous literature on the relationship between legal enforcement and the trade-off between AEM and REM, we consider whether the CSR orientation plays a moderating role in this relationship. We base our study on a sample of 5,863 firm-year observations for 1,141 unique firms, covering 24 different countries over the period 2003-2009. We find that CSR-oriented firms are less likely to engage in REM than in AEM. Moreover, we document that in strong legal enforcement countries, incentives to use REM instead of AEM are significantly lower in companies with a high CSR orientation than in companies with a low CSR orientation. These findings are consistent with the expectation that CSR-oriented companies are less likely to engage in the more costly but harder to detect earnings management strategy, i.e. the strategy that alters the underlying real operations of the company (REM). We provide additional evidence for our arguments that CSR-oriented firms are more likely to give up REM than AEM because of its detrimental value on future performance. All together our evidence suggests that CSR orientation acts as a constraint for REM and in doing so it contributes to the creation of value for all stakeholders. © 2015 University of Illinois.","Accrual earnings management; Corporate social responsibility; Enforcement; Performance; Real earnings management",,"Michelon, G.; University of Exeter Business SchoolUnited Kingdom; email: G.Michelon@exeter.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",00207063,,,,"English","Int.

However, there is agreement within the CSR and corporate governance literatures that there is a lack of thorough empirical studies of these effects. Based on a case study of the multinational wind energy company Suzlon Energy's CSR projects in rural India, this article contends that CSR projects implemented through cross-sector partnerships can help to build the capacities of civil society organizations (CSOs). Although the risk of corporate steering of the civil society agenda is reduced when CSR prioritizes community needs over business imperatives, CSOs tend to bear the highest costs in partnerships, through credibility losses and insecurity concerning project terms and funding, reinforcing the importance of critical cooperation and complementary core competencies in cross-sector partnerships.

King III has accordingly made independent CSR assurance a de facto mandatory requirement, albeit on an “apply or explain” basis. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) assurance practices in South Africa, within a King III context. Design/methodology/approach – To understand the impact of King III on South African CSR assurance practices, a longitudinal study covering reporting periods both before and after King III implementation. The first stage reviewed the annual reports of the 200 largest JSE-listed companies to establish the frequency of CSR assurance provision. The second stage involved performing a content analysis on the CSR assurance reports. Findings – King III is driving the institutionalisation of CSR assurance practices in South Africa, as evidenced by the growth in CSR assurance since the implementation of King III. The study also found that the audit profession’s dominance was being eroded by specialist CSR assurors providing higher levels of assurance, despite concerns about the rigour of their assurance methodologies. Voluntary CSR assurance practices have resulted in the inconsistent application of CSR assurance practices, impairing the ability of stakeholders to understand the nature and scope of CSR assurance engagements. It is argued that this deficiency may be overcome through the imposition of a mandatory CSR assurance regime. Originality/value – The pervasive impact of the King Code of Governance on South African organisations makes it appropriate to examine its impact on South African CSR assurance practices. As such, this paper represents one of the first studies to specifically consider the impact of a mandatory regulatory requirement for independent CSR assurance and suggests a future direction for global CSR assurance practices. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Assurance; Assurance provider; Conclusions/opinions; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); King III; Mandatory/voluntary",,"Ackers, B.; College of Accounting Sciences, University of South AfricaSouth Africa",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09513574,,,,"English","Account.

The paper derives its theoretical foundation from the stakeholder, instrumental and legitimacy theories, which all justify the use of CSRE for actualisation of Triple Bottom Line (i.e. the social, economic and environmental concerns of business organisations). Design/methodology/approach - The study used the quantitative research method relying on the use of secondary data published by institutional bodies. The quantitative method entail a systematic extraction of reliable data on corporate social responsibility (CSR), insecurity, poverty and development from the publications of Office of the Millennium Development Goals in Nigeria, CLEEN Foundation, National Bureau of Statistics and Central Bank of Nigeria, respectively. For missing years, the authors improvised using projections as well as proxies. The extracted data, which spanned a period of 13 years, were subjected to econometric tests using SPSS, on the basis of which informed conclusions were drawn. Findings - The first econometric result indicates a negative relationship between gross domestic product and poverty. The second result indicates that there is a positive significant relationship between gross domestic product and total crime rate. The third result indicates that there exists a positive relationship between gross domestic product and unemployment rate. The fourth result indicates that there is a negative relationship between gross domestic product and industrial growth rate. The last result indicates that there is a significant positive relationship between gross domestic product and CSR. Research limitations/implications - The results of this research have macro-level application, hence the outcomes cannot be narrowed to any particular sector of the economy. A micro-level analysis across diverse sectors of the economy is recommended in future studies. The implication of this empirical research is that policymakers in the Nigerian private sector need to reinvent their CSR programmes as mechanisms for poverty eradication, entrepreneurship development (CSRE), dousing tension of restive youth, empowerment/support for security agencies for better crime prevention and for impacting on sustainable development. Practical implications - In the face of dwindling financial resources in the treasury of governments, the reinvention of CSRE by private sector organisations as complementary mechanisms for combating social problems is becoming acceptable in both developed and developing nations. This paper therefore boldly recommends that policymakers reinvent CSRE as development mechanisms through a sound partnership between government, advocacy groups and business corporations in Nigeria. Social implications - The paper explicates that CSR can indeed be reinvented by corporations as part of their social concerns to their operating environment instead of leaving all social problems to governments. Originality/value - The research lends credence to stakeholder, instrumental and legitimacy theories of CSR. It also justifies the plausibility of CSRE, a novel concept being promoted in this research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Entrepreneurship; Insecurity; Poverty; Underdevelopment",,"Raimi, L.; Centre for Entrepreneurship Development (CED), College of TechnologyNigeria",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

However, the view that capitalism needs to reinvent itself to survive the crisis of confidence brought about by the recent global financial collapse depends on the extent to which such a shared value oriented, sustainable capitalist reinvention is embraced by emergent business leaders. A sustainable system of capitalism driven by business and community shared value can only take root if the hearts and minds of future business leaders are convinced of their cogency and appropriateness. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper reports the findings of an empirical study utilizing a Likert-type scale designed to measure corporate shared value (CSV) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) among a sample of fourth year accountancy students at a leading South African university. Findings – Preliminary findings suggest that perceptions of this group of emergent leaders generally regard CSR rather than CSV as the “correct” business model for companies to follow. Although the sample is limited to one South African university and is relatively small, it contributes to the literature by offering insight into emergent business leaders’ perceptions and their view of the direction of CSR in South Africa should take. Research limitations/implications – Implications of the paper are that by offering insight into emergent business leaders’ perceptions of South African society and specifically their view of the direction South African CSR should take, the paper suggests prescriptive remedial steps in policy that educational and other learning institutions could take to engender appropriate social values in learners.

Structural equation modelling was used to assess these relationships, using a 20 point questionnaire answered by 412 respondents. The results indicate that “others-related” CSR experiences are positively associated with satisfaction and commitment, while “self-related” CSR experiences with the latter variable. Likewise, organizational commitment, unlike job satisfaction, was linked to work engagement. However, contrary to our a priori assumptions and prior research, it turned out that job satisfaction was not a predictor of commitment. The paper discusses theoretical and practical implications of the findings. The study's most important practical implication is that Polish hotel employees attach weight to responsible behaviour: the hotel industry should perceive CSR in terms of strategic significance. Companies that want a committed and engaged workforce – and, by extension, to enhance their competitiveness – should embrace CSR.

The results show that firms with higher CSR scores have significantly lower cost of equity capital. In particular, we find that investments in improving CSR towards investors make the greatest contribution to reducing firms’ equity financing costs, and the cost of capital effects of CSR is more significant in recessions than in economic booms. In addition, SOEs have better CSR and lower cost of equity capital than NSOEs, but the effect of CSR in reducing the cost of equity capital is greater for NSOEs than for SOEs.

The research found that stakeholders other than the hotels played pivotal roles in the implementation of CSR programs and that there was a preference for involvement by hotels in local projects, over those situated elsewhere in the country or internationally. These hotels tended to partner with other non-hotel stakeholders to execute their external CSR programs and for these to be directed at social issues rather than environmental issues.

Few studies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in developing countries have looked into whether the information disclosed by companies is satisfactory with sufficient response after a major incident has happened. Design/methodology/approach – Five companies with the largest market value in the Chinese railway industry involved in the production of trains and railway systems connected to the “7.23” incident were taken as the observations in this study. Information published by the companies and the media related to the accident, including CSR and sustainability reports, company Web sites, news and press releases and Internet postings, were investigated in detail in a qualitative manner. Findings – The findings show that disclosure of information related to the “7.23” incident was very low or almost inexistent in the observed companies. For those that claimed that they had followed CSR reporting standards and guidelines, the disclosed information appeared to be insufficient to reveal practical information and fulfill stakeholders’ requirements. The study also sheds light on the corporate reporting behaviors of Chinese state-owned enterprises by applying legitimacy, stakeholder and institutional theories to the unique social and political environment in the country. Originality/value – This paper critically reveals the poor corporate response after the “7.23” incident in Chinese railway companies. The case serves as an example for the companies to ponder on what improvements are called for in terms of social reporting and relevant corporate actions after a major accident.

Using the ready-made garments’ (RMG) industry in Bangladesh as a case study, challenges and key issues relating to CSR are highlighted. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws from the review of existing literature, and the content analysis of two leading newspapers in Bangladesh for a period of one year (July 2012-June 2013) to identify the key and contemporary issues related to CSR in the RMG industry. Findings – Findings identify the contemporary issues of concerns associated with CSR in the RMG industry, relating them to the debate on the applicability of Carroll’s CSR pyramid to developing countries. The findings suggest that non-compliance of CSR in labour-intensive industries is a function of the nature of economic globalization. The need for a stakeholder approach towards CSR for the profitability and sustainability of this industry is also highlighted. Practical implications – This paper makes contributions to two different but important interrelated discourses on CSR and economic globalization. It also provides insights into the complexity involved in CSR in labour-based export industries in developing countries and acts as a springboard for further research.

The authors seek to determine whether firms disclose corporate social responsibility (CSR) information in a genuine attempt to report their impact on society and environment or whether firms use CSRD as a shield to legitimise their business operations. Design/methodology/approach - Signal breaches from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence and Chande's TrendScore technical trading indicators were utilised, while the voluntary environmental and social accounting disclosure index developed by Williams (1998) was adapted to measure the extent of CSRD by Singaporean firms in 2011. Ordinary least squares regression was the principal multivariate statistical technique used to analyse the data collected. Findings - Findings of this paper indicate a positive and significant association between the number of technical indicator signal breaches for a firm and the level of CSRD by that firm, particularly in the environment, energy, human resources and products and customers categories. Research limitations/implications - The collection of CSRD information is based solely on annual reports and within the context of Singapore. Results, therefore, are not completely generalisable to different jurisdictional settings. Practical implications - Findings suggest that firms with a volatile stock price trend provide greater CSRD, possibly as a legitimacy strategy to distract or change the perceptions of investors from its current legitimacy status. Findings, therefore, highlight to regulators the need to strengthen regulatory requirements and implement stricter guidelines on CSR reporting, given the importance of CSRD to users. Social implications - Findings from this study have several implications for various stakeholders including investors, regulators and society in general. Overall, findings also suggest that stakeholders should not rely solely on CSRD in their decision-making process. Originality/value - This is the first paper that has proxied stock price movement by using breaches in technical trading indicators when examining reported levels of CSRD by firms.

This is because many factors indirectly influence this relation. Therefore, this study considers sustainable competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction as three probable mediators in the relationship between CSR and firm performance. The findings from 205 Iranian manufacturing and consumer product firms reveal that the link between CSR and firm performance is a fully mediated relationship. The positive effect of CSR on firm performance is due to the positive effect CSR has on competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction. The final findings show that only reputation and competitive advantage mediate the relationship between CSR and firm performance. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for CSR in indirectly promoting firm performance through enhancing reputation and competitive advantage while improving the level of customer satisfaction. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Competitive advantage; Corporate social responsibility; Customer satisfaction; Firm performance; Iran; Reputation",,"Saeidi, S.P.; Faculty of Management, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM SkudaiMalaysia",,"Elsevier Inc.",01482963,,JBRED,,"English","J.

In particular, the study interrogates the impact of the three CSR dimensions of awareness, involvement and environmental awareness vis-a-vis the two dimensions of EE, namely, Job Engagement (JE) and Organizational Engagement (OE). A total of 380 Eskom employees were used as participants. The major findings were that organizational leaders are eager to implement CSR strategies. The study further revealed realistic and practical practises to broaden understanding of the current status of the organization, understanding EE and understanding the role CSR could play as a potential Human Resources (HR) tool to engage employees for Eskom and other organizations in general.

Reasons behind the implementation level are also evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative and qualitative company level data from 28 Australian small to medium sized construction enterprises were collected using an in-depth questionnaire. Levels of CSR implementation in three aspects, namely, environmental, social and ethical, were measured. Each aspect was broken down into sub-areas and implementation scores were aggregated and normalised. Awareness level and concern for economic aspect, the two hypothesised reasons for level of implementation, were also measured. Non-parametric correlation analyses were used to examine the hypotheses. Findings - The findings suggest small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) incorporate some aspects of CSR into their business activities even though they do not refer to the practices as CSR, as none of them have a formal CSR policy in place. Most SMEs in the construction industry implement ethical and economic aspect of CSR; however implementation across environmental and social issues is limited. Non-parametric correlation analyses show that higher awareness of CSR issues leads to higher levels of implementation and that concern about economic aspect is not a reason why CSR is not implemented into business practices. Research limitations/implications - Everett Rogers' diffusion paradigm can also be applied to CSR implementation, but more research works are required to theoretically and empirically examine the relationships between CSR implementation and economic aspect. Originality/value - It is apparent that there is a significant gap in the research regarding Australian SMEs and sustainability issues as the majority of the literature is focused upon large organisations even though the approaches taken by SMEs towards CSR are very different to those of large corporations. The SME business sector is a significant sector in terms of its environmental, economic and social impacts. Hence recognition of this sector is growing and is now becoming the focus of an agenda to promote the implementation of CSR practices in SMEs.

However, the supply of CSR assurance is not widespread in the United States, and CSR performance information remains largely separated from supporting and governance information. We thus examine the role of CSR assurance when information on CSR investment level is integrated with information on whether managerial pay is explicitly tied to sustainability. While a firm may report a high level of CSR investment to indicate an authentic commitment to CSR, investors may become skeptical of reported information if managerial pay is explicitly tied to CSR performance. Such pay-for-CSRperformance provides managers with greater incentives to overinvest in CSR and thereby report strong CSR performance. In turn, investors will seek CSR assurance as a disclosure credibility signal. Accordingly, we find that, in the presence of pay-for-CSRperformance and high CSR investment level, investors’ stock price assessments are greater only when CSR assurance is also present. Our findings highlight the importance of examining CSR disclosure factor interaction effects, and provide support for the expansion of CSR assurance and integrated reporting. © 2015, American Accounting Association.

Study 1 shows that customers are less likely to experience anger and spread negative word of mouth following a service failure when a firm engages in high (donating 15% of profits to environmental conservation) but not low (donating 2% of profits) levels of environmental CSR, but only if customers are high in environmental concern. In Study 2, the authors explore the benefits of CSR policies that target a broader range of beneficiaries versus policies that offer customers a choice over the firm's CSR allocations. Compared with a no-CSR policy, CSR with choice has a stronger effect on customers' emotions and intentions by enhancing perceived value alignment, reducing anger and regret over choosing the firm, and increasing guilt over harming the firm. These emotions subsequently reduce negative word of mouth and increase positive word of mouth and repurchase intentions. The results support the benefits of value-aligned and choice-based CSR policies in the wake of service failures. © 2015, American Marketing Association.","Cause-related marketing; Corporate social responsibility; Negative word of mouth; Positive word of mouth; Service failures; Value alignment",,,,"American Marketing Association",07439156,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: This study divides CSR into proactive CSR and reactive CSR. This research employs an empirical study by means of the questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and to explore its managerial implications in Taiwanese manufacturing companies. Structural equation modeling is applied to verify the research framework. Findings: The empirical results verify that green organizational culture positively affects proactive CSR and green product innovation performance. This study shows that proactive CSR mediates the positive relationship between green organizational culture and green product innovation performance, but reactive CSR does not. Green organizational culture is a driving force for proactive CSR and green product innovation performance. Organizational members in Taiwanese companies are exposed to green organizational culture which influences CSR activities. Moreover, this study verifies that proactive CSR of large companies are significantly higher than those of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Research limitations/implications: There are three limitations of this study. First, this study verifies the hypotheses by means of questionnaire survey which only includes cross-sectional data. Second, this study utilize self-reported data may suffer the problems of common method variance. Third, this study applies a “five-point Likert scale” ranging from 1 to 5 to measure the constructs. Future research can apply a “seven-point Likert scale” to measure the constructs and compare with this study to test the significance of the variability of the data. There are two implications emerging from the study. First, proactive CSR has a positive effect on green product innovation performance, but reactive CSR does not. Second, green organizational culture is a driving force for proactive CSR and green product innovation performance. Originality/value: This study summarizes the literature of CSR into a new managerial framework and highlights the importance of proactive CSR. Therefore, green organizational culture cannot only affect green product innovation performance directly, but also influence it indirectly via proactive CSR in the Taiwanese manufacturing industry. Taiwanese manufacturing companies can increase their green organizational culture and proactive CSR to enhance their green product innovation performance.

In order to address this objective, the authors show to what extent various social and environmental categories are covered in the CSR reports. The authors also investigate whether any differences in the use of CSR indicators can be found with regard to the use of a formal reporting framework, the size of a company, location of its headquarter, and ownership structure. Design/methodology/approach – The study begins with a comprehensive literature review on the CSR policies and practices in relation to the field of logistics. A database of 350 international LSPs is compiled based on independent rankings of top logistics companies. Applying a content analysis approach, corporate web sites and CSR reports are examined in order to investigate how sustainability is reported and what CSR-related indicators are published. Statistical analysis is carried out to provide insight into whether any differences in the use of CSR indicators can be found with regard to four key factors identified in the literature review. Findings – Although aspects of sustainability are mentioned on corporate web sites of most LSPs in the database (53 per cent), only 13 per cent publish formal CSR reports. This research identifies a variety of indicators used by LSPs and shows that the use of a formal reporting framework and the size of a company are the two main factors influencing the levels of CSR reporting in the sector. Practical implications – This paper provides an insight into how transparently LSPs report on the sustainability of their performance. LSPs can compare their own CSR reporting approaches to the body of scientific literature and the findings presented in this paper, in order to adapt more general concepts and best practice evidence to their needs. Social implications – By focusing on best practice in reporting of the environmental and social performance, this research can potentially improve the long-term sustainability of the logistics sector. Originality/value – This is the first study providing a comprehensive review of the CSR reporting practice in the third party logistics sector. As such, this paper provides an important basis for CSR-related research in the field of logistics and supply chain management. Several areas for future research are also identified. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR reports; Environmental and social performance indicators; Logistics service providers; Sustainability",,"Piecyk, M.I.; Logistics Research Centre, Heriot-Watt UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09600035,,,,"English","Int.

To convince both industries to increase investment in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, the authors have presented the results on the relationships between investment in CSR programs and the financial-based and market-based performances. Design/methodology/approach - The study focuses on the data during 2010-2011 of the listed Thai firms in industrial products and resources industries due to the environmental impacts caused by both industries. The findings show that firms receiving a higher CSR index score also have a higher return on assets (ROA), indicating efficient use of the assets. In addition, investment in CSR programs produces a positive outcome within two years, on average, after the investment. As the study period is two years (2010-2011), no relationships are found between the CSR index and return on equity (ROE) and between the index and Tobin'Q. Findings - The findings show that firms with a higher CSR index have higher ROA, thereby indicating a more efficient use of the assets. In addition, the positive outcome of investment in CSR programs can be realized within a relatively short-time period, i.e. two years on average after investment. As the study data cover only two years (2010-2011), no relations are detected between the CSR index and ROE and Tobin'Q. Research limitations/implications - Not many research papers have been studied by using emerging market evidence. The interest in CSR in Thailand is just in its early stage. The study examines the association between multicollinearity by using variance inflation factors (VIF), and it shows no defect on the matter. In addition, the data have been checked for the defects in the outliner, which is very variable. It could be affected to the regression coefficient analysis. The table of casewise diagnostics shows that the outliner containing standard residual diversifies regression equation, and it could also misconceive the variable of Y; therefore, the researcher would exclude the mentioned area before analyzing the data. Durbin-Watson statistic is used to do the error check of ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, which were found to be 1.938, 1.817 and 1.931, respectively. The mean varies between 1.5 and 2.5, which means covariance. Additionally, association of independent variable could be checked to ensure that the independent variable has no relationship. It could be noticed from Tolerance and VIF, if Tolerance is close to zero or VIF is over 10.0, it means that one of independent variables has associated with other variables. It implies that there is no multicollinearity problem in this study. Originality/value - This is the first study in Thailand that looks into the effects of CSR activities of industrial products and resources sectors of the industry due to the pollution-prone nature of both industries. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Firm performance; Industrial products industry; Resources industry",,"Janamrung, B.; Faculty of Business, Mahanakorn University of TechnologyThailand",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Design/methodology/approach - This study uses ordinary least squares regression to examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and employee performance and between CSR and employee cost. Further, 2SLS is used to address the endogeneity issue. Findings - The results indicate a positive relation between CSR and employee performance, suggesting that employees in socially responsible companies generate better operating performance than their peers in less socially responsible companies. Findings also reveal that socially responsible companies incur higher labor cost. Research limitations/implications - First, the CSR ratings constructed by KLD Inc. are an approximate measure of CSR performance. Better CSR measures may yield stronger results. Additionally, the sample firms in our study are relatively large firms. Caution needs be exercised when readers generalize these conclusions. Finally, this sample only consists of public firms. Whether these conclusions hold in private firms remains unknown. The above issues can be investigated in future studies. Practical implications - The findings of our study should interest managers who contemplate engaging in socially responsible activities, investors and financial analysts who assess firm performance and policymakers who design and implement guidelines on CSR programs. Originality/value - This is the first paper that directly tests the association between CSR and employee performance and cost. Thus, this study contributes to the CSR literature by offering evidence to show a positive effect of CSR on employee performance.

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis in this paper was based on data collected by a team of experts in the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry from more than 555 United Arab Emirates (UAE) individuals, aged 18 years or older. Our study postulated that there will be no statistically significant differences in any or all of the five reactions among respondents with different age, varying degree of CSR awareness, working preference, donation and boycotting behavior, and methods of complaining about companies or their products. Findings - Gender analysis indicated that there is a statistically significant difference between male and female in terms of boycotting and complaining behaviors. Our analysis also showed that young consumers in the age group of 18-24 years react significantly different than older age group in terms of job preference. Third, the results of location analysis indicated that the UAE consumers' contacting behavior to a company to voice an opinion about a company's product or services are significantly different across the seven Emirates of UAE. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study have many implications. First, there is no doubt that such findings will raise the consumers' awareness of CSR. UAE companies will become more cognizant of their consumers' behavior, especially when the consumers' voice their opinion and show interest in the products or services offered by these companies. The implications of this study for the academics are that this study can be replicated in different parts of the globe to confirm or refute our findings. Practical implications - The findings of this study will enable UAE companies to design and implement strategies that aim at increasing their efficiency, competitiveness and the ability to compete in global markets. Social implications - Many of the developing economies started to realize how important CSR is. A fast growing economy such as that of UAE has given such topic an unprecedented attention. The social implication of our findings is that UAE corporations will have to rethink their strategies when it comes to their social responsibility toward society in which they exist. Our findings also enlighten consumers when it comes to their dealing with socially responsible corporations.

It is hypothesized that the better the perceptions, the higher the behavioral intention. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies are proposed as the perfect tool to improve consumer perceptions and, hence, increase the customer base of large organizations. Such an approach has randomly been explored in the existing literature, making the examination of the proposed conceptual framework of the study an interesting research topic. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed conceptual framework was tested on a sample of Greek consumers. The final sample consisted of 454 adult consumers. The reliability and the validity of the newly developed questionnaire were thoroughly examined. Empirical data were analyzed using the “Structural Equation Modeling” technique. Findings – The results of the quantitative research highlighted the negative perceptions of Greek consumers toward large companies but, at the same time, revealed the statistically significant positive effect of certain dimensions of consumer perceptions on behavioral intention. In more detail, “interest toward community and employees” and “contribution to economic prosperity” seem to enhance behavioral intention, with the first being the most important factor. Research limitations/implications – A limitation stemming from the implemented methodology is the use of self-report scales to measure the constructs of the proposed model. Moreover, as the measurement of consumer perceptions has never been attempted in the existing literature, the items used to measure this construct were created after an extensive review of theoretical papers, failing to incorporate scales that have been already tested for their reliability. Practical implications – Using the findings of the empirical analysis as guiding lights, the present study proposes certain measures for large organizations. Highly proposed policies are offered in the final part of the paper. These policies are connected with enhancing the perceived interest of the company toward its community and employees. Originality/value – The present paper proposes a conceptual framework that examines CSR under a context that has been randomly examined before. It goes beyond theoretical principles and approaches issues that are vital for large organizations. Moreover, the results of the study may be generalized in other developed countries with similar economic realities (e.g. Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioral intention; Consumer perceptions; Corporate social responsibility; Empirical research; Greece; Structural equation modeling",,"Chatzoudes, D.; Department of Production and Management Engineering, Democritus University of ThraceGreece",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1754243X,,,,"English","Int.

More recently, CSR has increasingly attracted governments’ attention, and is now promoted in public policy, especially in the European Union (EU). Conflicts can arise, however, when advanced welfare states introduce CSR into public policy. The reason for such conflict is that CSR leaves key public welfare issues to the discretion of private business. This voluntary issue assignment contrasts starkly with advanced welfare states’ traditions favoring negotiated agreements and strong regulation to control corporate conduct. This article analyzes the conflicts and compatibilities arising when advanced welfare states introduce CSR, focusing on how the two traditions diverge and on how conflicts are reconciled. Empirically the study focuses on four Nordic countries—Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden—widely recognized as the most advanced welfare states, and increasingly as leaders in CSR public policy. From interviews of 55 officials of government ministries, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, and employer associations, the authors conclude that tension indeed exists between CSR public policies and advanced welfare state traditions in all four countries. Whereas CSR’s aims are compatible with Nordic institutional traditions, the means promoted in CSR is in conflict with such Nordic traditions as corporatist agreements and rights-based welfare state regulation of social and environmental issues. There is harmony of goals, but conflict in means between the four Nordic countries studied. © The Author(s) 2012.","business and political strategies; corporate social responsibility (CSR); politics; regulation",,"Midttun, A.; BI Norwegian Business School, Nydalsveien 37, Norway",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach - It was decided to ascertain whether the quality of information regarding sustainability provided in connection with the remuneration policies of listed companies tallies with the general quality of information regarding sustainability provided through companies’ main (obligatory and voluntary) reporting procedures. Findings - The results of this research show that the inconsistency between the information provided in voluntary and obligatory reports (between reports on sustainability and remuneration reports) extends to the levels of information provided in the two types of obligatory report (the reports on remuneration and on management); there is also a discrepancy between the levels of information provided in these reports and the evaluation of that information by an external assessor. Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of this research is that as the data examined were gleaned from public documents, it is not necessarily an accurate reflection of all the information that firms have at their disposal on questions of sustainability and remuneration policies. The existence of internal documents containing other information, and therefore leading to different results, cannot be ruled out. Originality/value - This study is the first in Italy to examine the question of how limited companies report issues relating to management by objectives-corporate social responsibility. It does this through the introduction of a mixed system for ESG information, which counteracts the subjective limitations of the internal evaluation provided by the research group by adding in the authoritative evaluations of an external assessor. ©, 2015.

This article explores the concept of “responsible tax” as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) issue for MNEs, based on the notion that MNEs face considerable variation in the extent, monitoring, and application of tax laws internationally. This variation creates a “moral free space” as to which tax payments to make. Using firm-level data from three important sectors in India, the authors explore whether foreign MNE subsidiaries pay higher taxes than local firms, and whether, in the case of MNEs, there are differences between subsidiaries of MNEs with and without a reputation for CSR. The results show that MNEs pay considerably higher effective tax rates than do local firms, and MNE subsidiaries known for CSR pay more tax than do MNE subsidiaries less known for CSR. This set of findings suggests that MNEs operating in India see taxation in developing countries in relation to CSR. © The Author(s) 2012.","corporate social responsibility; developing countries; India; local companies; multinational enterprises; taxation",,"Muller, A.; University of Amsterdam Business School, Plantage Muidergracht 12, M2.19, Netherlands",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

This paper specifies key antecedents of engagement within the theoretical framework of the self-determination theory as it relates to employee engagement and CSR. Design/methodology/approach – The methods used for the purpose of this paper include a review of the relevant literature utilizing the descriptors of employee engagement, SDT and CSR. Alternative descriptors were not queried. The authors then selected articles that were found to be most cited, reviewed such articles and began to analyze the literature, synthesize and formulate connections. Findings – Based on research findings, a conceptual model was formulated and posited for research and practice. It is demonstrated in the paper that employee engagement has a wide range of benefits for all involved and focuses on key antecedents of engagement created through CSR initiatives and intrinsic motivating factors as pointed out from SDT, which may serve to provide a comprehensive representation of the likely influences of intrinsic motivating drivers on employee engagement.

Design/methodology/approach – These effects were tested using a 2 (CA: good vs poor)×2 (CSR: continuous vs one-time) between-subjects experiment. The company with good CA was depicted as a top 20 Fortune 500 company, but in the poor CA condition, it faced disappointing financial outcomes due to the failure of its new product. To manipulate the different levels of CSR, the company’s charitable giving and community involvement was described as a continuous commitment or one-time donation. Findings – Continuous CSR commitment significantly increased consumers’ positive attitudes, purchase intention, and willingness to support an organization. These positive effects become particularly more powerful for a company with poor business performance. Participants attributed more sincere and less image-promotion motives of CSR to a company with poor CA than to that with good CA. For the company with poor CA, both types of CSR motives mediated the relationship between CSR and the outcomes, while only sincere motives served as a mediator for the company with good CA. Practical implications – The findings suggest the possibility that CSR initiatives pursued by unprofitable companies may be more recognized and appreciated than those by business giants. Thus, a company should maintain its CSR activities as a long-term strategy, especially when the company is not an industry leader. Originality/value – This research suggests that the mediating role of perceived CSR motives can be contingent upon CA. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate ability; Corporate social responsibility; Inferred motives; Moderated mediation",,"Park, H.; Manship School of Mass Communication, Louisiana State UniversityUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1363254X,,,,"English","J.

First, the authors examine the interplay between CSR messages and country image, and second, how consumers’ global identity affects their response to CSR signals. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual framework is examined in two samples of US consumers evaluating a new foreign entrant into the US market. Findings – The empirical findings largely support the conceptual framework. Consistent with expectations, CSR and country image influence attitudes and purchase intentions. Most importantly, the authors also find a significant interaction effect between CSR and country of origin (COO). Further, consumers high on global identity are more responsive to positive CSR signals. These findings are confirmed in two complimentary studies. Practical implications – CSR has become an important strategic priority for managers. This study allows managers to make more informed decisions regarding the CSR initiatives of their organizations. Originality/value – This study connects the CSR literature with the COO literature, both of which are very important in the international marketing literature.

Enhanced business tax deductions for charitable donations and credits for conservation easements are notable cases. While providing incentives for socially desirable behavior to achieve legislative goals has intuitive appeal, the broader economic consequences are not always fully understood. In this study, we examine such wider consequences for supply chains when subsidies for CSR are offered. One effect we identify is that since incentives are typically tied to market value, firms have not only an added incentive to achieve societal objectives (say by donating inventory) but also an incentive to raise output (retail) market prices. A second consequence is that since firms forgo potential revenues by engaging in socially desired behavior, they become increasingly sensitive to supplier pricing; in an uncoordinated supply chain this leads to input (wholesale) price concessions. Among other things, the results underscore that incentives put in place to meet broader societal objectives also have notable ramifications for suppliers, retailers, and consumers in primary markets. © 2014 Production and Operations Management Society.","corporate social responsibility; philanthropy; pricing; supply chains",,,,"Wiley-Blackwell",10591478,,,,"English","Prod.

It is argued that information regarding community development CSR, the providers of CSR and the outcomes of CSR on community development in Malaysia has been scant. Hence, this study examines specifically the profiles of participants of CSR programmes in community development, the profiles of selected CSR-participating corporations, the orientation of CSR responsibilities undertaken by corporations as perceived by the participants and the types of community development contribution from CSR-participating corporations. Outcomes were determined through the results of the last two objectives. Design/methodology/approach - Building on the stakeholder theory and the work of Visser's CSR pyramid, this article explores the outcomes of CSR resulting from the participation of individuals in the community. Data were gathered from 336 respondents who were participants of CSR programmes sampled from 58 local and multinational corporations in Malaysia. Findings - The results showed that about half of the respondents were in the younger age group with a mean age of 24.40 years. The majority of the CSR-participating corporations had implemented CSR programmes from the first decade of the millennium and had their core businesses in diverse sectors. Legal responsibility was ranked the most important orientation and ethical responsibility the least important orientation. Education-related activities formed the dominant type of CSR contribution.

Developing countries have promoted CSR but concepts and approaches can be different from those in developed countries due to geographic, political, and economic contexts. In a unique developing country of China, the government has initially encouraged state-owned companies (SOCs) to implement CSR practices. However, no clear and commonly accepted CSR definition or concept exists. This paper develops items on CSR practices mainly based on the internationally accepted ISO26000 framework while integrating characteristics of Chinese SOCs. Statistical results of 146 usable questionnaires show that Chinese SOCs implement four types of CSR practices under the ISO26000 framework, they are those related to employee rights, consumer issues, fair operation and labor practices. Charity is a specific CSR dimension in China, but it is only implemented at the low level. Chinese SOCs have the high internal CSR values which promote most CSRs except those related to charity and employee rights. External institutional drivers for CSR practices are relatively low. Normative drivers motivate most CSR practices while competitive drivers only motivate consumer issues-related CSR practices. This paper contributes to extend previous studies mainly for developed countries to develop a CSR concept for Chinese SOCs by using both the international ISO26000 framework and considering the specific context. Statistic results identify how to motivate CSR practices among Chinese SOCs effectively, which can provide implications for not only the Chinese government, but also multi-national companies that do or plan to do business in China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, the study utilizes rhetorical theory as a framework for data analysis. A qualitative study, based on face-to-face interviews, was conducted among 27 employees in a Finnish financial firm. The study identifies six categories of emotional arguments the employees used to construct views of where their employing organization's CSR is derived from. These categories relate positive emotions to satisfaction with the employing organization's CSR and negative emotions to dissatisfaction. The results show that employees also experience external pressures for CSR, but only implicitly, because they do not wish be embarrassed by their employer. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Corporate social responsibility; Emotions; Employees; Financing firm; Rhetoric",,"Onkila, T.; School of Business and Economics, University of Jyväskylä, PO Box 35, Finland",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",15353958,,,,"English","Corp.

Yet, the impact of CSR on public reaction to corporate crises is more complex. Drawing on research on stakeholder reactions to CSR and-more specifically-corporate crises, we present a contingent framework for understanding the roles of CSR in corporate crises and how to manage it. This framework posits that CSR plays four important roles: it (1) increases stakeholders' attention to crises, (2) affects blame attributions, (3) raises expectations, and (4) changes stakeholders' evaluations of crisis situations. Several factors underlying these roles are also discussed. Overall, this article underscores that while CSR may insulate companies and mitigate stakeholders' negative responses in some cases, in others it may actually lead to the opposite effect, amplifying the negative impact of a crisis. The article ends with a brief discussion of the implications of our framework for effective crisis management strategies in the age of CSR. © 2014 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","Corporate crisis; Corporate social responsibility; Crisis management; Insulation",,"Janssen, C.; IESEG School of Management (LEM-CNRS), Socle de la Grande Arche, 1 Parvis de la De´fense, France",,"Elsevier Ltd",00076813,,BHORA,,"English","Bus.

The three CSR dimensions referred to as the triple bottom line approach (financial, social and environmental) have been considered.

Various constituencies have found this market puzzling, as the level of assurance significantly lags international levels (Simnett et al. 2009; KPMG 2011). Results shed light on this enigma by demonstrating that, unlike their international counterparts, U.S. finance and utilities firms are not more likely (than firms in other industries) to obtain CSR assurance despite facing significant social and environmental risks. As these industries are highly regulated in the United States, regulatory oversight may be acting as a substitute for CSR assurance. We also find that highly leveraged firms are less likely to obtain CSR assurance, potentially due to stringent bank monitoring indirectly suppressing demand. Nonetheless, examining the capital market responses to CSR assurance makes the low demand even more puzzling. Specifically, CSR assurance is associated with lower cost of equity capital along with lower analyst forecast errors and dispersion. Furthermore, the reductions in cost-ofcapital and forecast dispersion are significantly higher when CSR assurance is provided by an accounting firm. These results have implications for companies that are considering CSR assurance and accounting firms in developing and marketing their CSR assurance services. © 2015, American Accounting Association.

Practical implementation of CSR requires analysis of both the external and internal environments to determine the prospects and challenges significantly influencing integration of sustainability into business strategy. In order to overcome limitations of single multiple-criteria decision analysis models, this paper proposes a hybrid integrated framework combining cognitive mapping and analytic networks process (ANP) to determine, prioritise and select CSR programmes for implementation. The strategic cognitive map serves as a foundation to build the ANP network and identify the importance of CSR programmes. A knapsack optimisation method is then used to optimally assign resources to CSR alternatives. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework through a case study in the extractive sector.

In response, managers rebalanced their priorities, paid more attention to the shareholders who demanded higher profits, and suspended ethical and discretionary responsibilities as a result.

Results reveal that personal values most strongly influence employees' orientation regarding economic results, whereas the impact on their attitudes towards environmental and social concern is weaker. From all sub-dimensions of values, only universalism values influence all three aspects of CSR, whereas five sub-dimensions, also having significant impact, influence either one or both the other two aspects of CSR.

To solve these issues, we propose a new framework based on fuzzy logic and visual analytics, which is capable of precisely assessing stakeholders' importance by indicating the exact degree of membership to a particular interest group. As an illustrative case study, this framework has been applied to construct and visualise the profile of key extractive sector stakeholders and measure their salience in a corporate social responsibility context.

Specifically, we examine whether CSR disclosures are context-specific, that is, whether companies dominated by powerful stakeholders are obliged to behave in a responsible manner to constrain earnings management, thereby reporting higher-quality earnings to investors. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores the relationship between CSR disclosures and earnings quality proxied by earnings accruals. Specifically, we examine whether CSR disclosures are context-specific, that is, whether companies dominated by powerful stakeholders are obliged to behave in a responsible manner to constrain earnings management, thereby reporting higher-quality earnings to investors. Findings – Results show that managers in an emerging economy manage earnings when they provide more CSR disclosures. Such earnings management is achieved through income increasing discretionary accruals. Furthermore, companies from export-oriented industries dominated by powerful stakeholders (international buyers) disclosing more CSR activities, provide transparent financial reports through constraining earnings management. Originality/value – The findings of this study are significant for both investors and policymakers. Investors should not take for granted that firms engage in CSR activities, behave ethically and provide transparent financial reports. As we document that firms might manipulate earnings through discretionary accruals and provide less transparent financial reports to shareholders, the credibility of firms’ CSR policies should be assessed with caution. Policies directing at promoting socially responsible practices instead of motivating the desired behaviour, may provide managers with additional incentives to utilise CSR for opportunistic behaviour. Thus, policymakers need to be cautious about this opportunistic behaviour and enhance monitoring to enforce social compliance. Possibly, some guidelines can be introduced to confirm that CSR disclosures are based on actual practice and not just a “green wash” statement to deceive stakeholders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Discretionary accruals; Earnings quality; Emerging economy; Opportunistic behaviour",,"Azim, M.I.; Department of Accounting, Swinburne University of TechnologyAustralia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02686902,,,,"English","Manage.

An empirical and analytical study was undertaken whereby the corporate official websites of the companies were analyzed for the time period 2006–2007 to 2008–2009. Data were then generated from such an analysis using qualitative document analysis. For this study, we used ‘number of sentences’ as the unit for measurement of CSR participation. Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation, multiple regression analysis and conjoint analysis were used to analyze the data. The study showed that the most preferred CSR activities were education, health and environment. Drinking water and sanitation and urban upliftment were the least preferred activities. A high level of dispersion was observed with respect to the least preferred activities; and a low level of dispersion was observed with the most preferred activities. Significant correlation was observed with respect to various CSR activities that the companies were responsive to. The activities which had a significant impact on the companies divided into deciles, at different levels, as per the multiple regression analysis were: education, health, environment, employability, rural upliftment, others and empowerment.

The key stakeholders included ""employees"" and ""unions"" as internal and ""public"", the ""media"" and the ""government"" as external stakeholders. The purpose was to estimate the influence of stakeholders that managers perceive as important. Moreover, the study sought to identify association between the CSR construct and corporate reputation and in turn whether this influences business performance. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a mail survey with a random sampling of senior managers sourced from Dun & Bradstreet's Australian business database, focusing on large organizations (i.e. minimum $10 million p.a. reported sales and minimum 100 employees) as the selection criteria. A conceptual model was developed and tested using structural equation modeling. Findings - The results identified that ""employees"" and the ""public"" are perceived to be the influential stakeholder groups in CSR decision-making. There was evidence of a positive relationship between the CSR construct and reputation, which in turn influenced market share, but not profitability. Research limitations/implications - This study examined a cross-section of organizations using Dun & Bradstreet's database of Australian businesses and may not fully represent the Australian business mix. The effective response rate of 7.2 per cent appears to be low, even though it is comparable with other research in the CSR area. There may have been some self-selection by the respondents, although there were no statistically significant differences identified in the corporate characteristics of those invited to participate and those responding with usable questionnaires. Practical implications - Managers can adopt a stakeholder-influenced CSR strategy to generate strong corporate reputation to improve business performance. It is important to ensure that the interests of ""employees"" and ""public"" stakeholders are addressed within organizational strategy. Respondents were less concerned about government stakeholders and thus government involvement in organizational CSR may need to be revisited. Social implications - The major concern that emerges from these findings is the absence of the perceived importance of regulatory stakeholders on firms' CSR activities. Regulatory controls of CSR messages could reduce or eliminate inaccurate and misleading information to the public. Originality/value - The analysis explains the perceived relative influence of stakeholders on CSR decisions. It also provides an understanding of the link between organizational CSR reputation and organization's performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited, ISSN 1747-1117.","Business performance; Corporate social responsibility; Market share; Profit; Stakeholders",,"Taghian, M.; Graduate School of Business, Deakin UniversityAustralia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Four concepts of CSR are used in this study including economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic. Market orientation (MO) comprises three behavioral components: customer orientation, competitor orientation, and inter-functional coordination. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data collected. The results showed that both CSR activities and MO have positive impact on firm performance. Through the analysis, legal factor (PL) almost has no significant. Only PL1 variable (with λ = .664) has significant and nearly compatible with ethical component. The study also suggests Vietnamese senior managers, CEOs, as well as owners should upgrade their perceptions about the importance of CSR, therefore they could improve their competitiveness into the market-orientation economy. A major limitation of this study is the examination of two concepts that impact on Vietnamese firms' performance.

The authors hypothesize that CSR engagements in the form of altruistic behaviour, with executives being part of the upper echelon, would tend to be expressing their values at individual level through the firm if they are affectively committed to their company. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of 151 Malaysian firms that took part in an annual CEO survey in 2010, the study measures executive citizenship as CEOs' having critical attitude towards public issues such as public transportation, public education and crime. Hierarchical regression analyses are used to associate the CEO attitudes with the firms CSR.

The authors also find that executive organizational commitment has a significant positive impact on dimensions of CSR. Additionally, the executive tenure impacts the level of philanthropic CSR of the firm.

The specific function of general utility, whose arguments are the levels to achieve the strategic objectives of the organization as a result of the project for the periods given the importance of the objectives and values of reduced costs for the project, is used as a target function. It is expected that the utility of the project will depend on how growth in levels to achieve the strategic objectives by periods occurs, while different growth rate of their level is preferred for different purposes. It is also expected that different structures of investing resources differ by preference for periods, due to which additional resource limitations for each time period are introduced in the model. The main difference between the proposed models is the ability to review the composition of the previously selected project portfolio at each step depending on the already achieved results and changes in internal and external conditions. © 2015, ASERS Publishing House.

This paper compares the effectiveness of a social incentive that takes the form of a donation received by a charity of the subject's choice to a financial incentive. We find that social incentives lead to a 13% rise in productivity, regardless of their form (lump sum or related to performance) or strength. The response is strong for subjects with low initial productivity (30%), whereas high-productivity subjects do not respond. When subjects can choose the mix of incentives, half sacrifice some of their private compensation to increase social compensation, with women more likely to do so than men. Furthermore, offering subjects some discretion in choosing their own payment schemes leads to a substantial improvement in performance. Comparing social incentives to equally costly increases in private compensation for low-productivity subjects reveals that the former are less effective in increasing productivity, but the difference is small and not statistically significant. © 2015 INFORMS.","Corporate philanthropy; Corporate social responsibility; Financial incentives; Gender; Prosocial behavior; Real effort experiment; Social incentives","Management science; Corporate philanthropies; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Financial incentives; Gender; Prosocial behavior; Social incentives; Productivity",,,"INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences",00251909,,MSCIA,,"English","Manage Sci",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938591663

Extant research has established that SR activity can be beneficial to companies by influencing consumers’ SR associations with the company and its product brands. However, most studies only look at the outcomes of SR implemented at the corporate level (i.e. corporate social responsibility [CSR]). This paper provides a new and expanded perspective by exploring how SR at the product brand level reverberates throughout the full brand portfolio. Drawing on associative network theory, the authors propose a conceptual model that predicts when and how SR associations with a product brand spillover to corporate brand and other product brands and the consequences of this spillover. Design/methodology/approach – Two experiments were conducted to test the conceptual model. The authors used utilitarian products (frozen yogurt, ice cream, and soft drink) in the first experiment and value-expressive products (running shoes, T-shirt and watch) in the second experiment. Findings – Both experiments found support for the proposed spillover effect. The moderating impact of corporate branding strategy and product category fit on the strength of spillover effect were also examined. Practical implications – The findings will help managers make better decisions about which brands (product and corporate level) should be involved in SR activity. Originality/value – This research offers a new perspective to look at the consequences of SR activity and reveals a larger picture than extant research on CSR by indicating the impact of a product brand’s SR initiative on the whole brand portfolio. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand portfolio; Corporate social responsibility; Social responsibility associations; Spillover effect",,"Wang, W.; Department of Business, Guilford CollegeUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",10610421,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the objective, a preference rating approach (synthesized in company preference rating (CPR) and company satisfaction assessment (CSA) approaches) has been used in two stages as: stage 1, relative importance rating (RIR) of identified issues has been computed using CPR approach. For this, preference graphs have been developed based on the field expert's opinions using graph-theory-based representation technique. In stage 2: competitive priority ratings of CSR issues with respect to competitive strategies have been calculated using CSA approach. Findings - Based on RIRs (stage 1), it has been noticed that issue namely ""social benefits for employees"" is more desirable among all considered issues. In stage 2, based on competitive priority ratings, the issue ""social benefits for employees"" is more important for an organization to build a better brand reputation through CSR activities and issue ""degree of CSR implementation"" is more significant in order to improve the SCP of an organization. The issue ""environmental protection"" helps the organization to reduce their overall environmental impact and also provides an aid in achieving long-term sustainable goals of an organization.

Various stakeholders as consumers, customers, employees, trade unions, communities, non-governmental organizations, foundations, donors, investors are more and more interested in the activities of companies (organizations), and influence on them in a variety of ways. Companies, for their part, also look for ways to meet the expectations of the public in the area of social responsibility. Corporate social responsiveness is an ability of business to respond to social pressure. The article analyzes the implementation of social responsiveness initiatives as organizational programs. Social responsiveness is understood as action dimension of corporate social responsibility. The paper deals with implementation of social responsiveness initiatives in Lithuania.

I argue that policy makers' dependencies, motivations, and decision-making processes lead them to evaluate firms by using sociopolitical reputation as a differentiating heuristic. I hypothesize that firms that construct stronger sociopolitical reputations will be granted greater access and that firms' existing political activity and policy makers' partisanship will moderate this relationship. I test these hypotheses using an 11-year panel on congressional testimony, reputation, and political and financial characteristics for the S&P 500 and find support for all three.

Contrary to expectations, the Marikana incident does not appear to have had a widespread and prolonged effect on the South African mining sector. This may be the result of the strike action already having been discounted into the price of mining shares, implying that the market was only reacting to the unusually violent (but short-lived) protest. Alternately, the results could be indicative of investor confidence in the corporate social responsibility initiatives of the South African mining industry as a whole. This paper is the first to examine the potential impact of the Marikana incident on the share prices of mining companies listed on the JSE. It should be of interest to both academics and practitioners wanting to understand how share prices react to exogenous events. It is also relevant for corporate-governance researchers concerned with the relevance of social and governance practices in a South African setting. This research is faced with the limitations associated with most statistical research: that causality cannot be ascribed to tested relationships.

When we examine CSR strengths and concerns separately, we find that a higher CSR strength (concern) score is associated with lower (higher) yield spreads. Our results on the effect of firm performance on seven individual CSR dimensions are generally consistent with our main findings.

This paper intends to analyse if the consumer knows about the meaning of social responsibility in the economic, social and environmental contexts. Design/methodology/approach - This paper used a survey to assess the perception of the consumer of the social responsibility practices of the Salsa brand. The questionnaires were administered to consumers in the north of Portugal. The survey questions were tested through an exploratory factor analysis. A least squares estimation was performed to test the hypotheses. Findings - The consumers revealed that they have four dimensions of perceptions of CSR: ecological reasons, no discrimination reasons, recycling reasons and communication reasons. The results suggest that the consumers consider that there are four aspects of CSR: economic, social, ecological and recycling. When it was verified that the personal concerns, regarding environment and recycling, play an important role in consumer decision, the seven stages of the consumer decision process developed by Blackwell et al. (2006) were evaluated. In this sense, it was observed that the knowledge of social responsibility practices and the dimensions of perceptions of CSR revealed by the consumers influence the purchase of the company's products. Originality/value - This paper obtained an interesting result in the sense that the consumers distinguish the environmental aspects on ecological and recycling. It is also observed that this distinction, allied to the knowledge of social responsibility practices carried out by the company, leads to the affirmation that the final disinvestment stage of the consumer decision process plays an important role in consumer decision. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand purchase; Consumer decision process; Factorial analysis; Regression; Social responsibility",,"Rodrigues, P.; Faculty of Economics and Management, Lusíada UniversityPortugal",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

The model uses a framework built upon a set of best practices in social responsibility by some of the largest mining companies in Peru. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology adopted emphasizes the scrutiny of best practices among 92 initiatives undertaken by 10 companies - 5 large and 5 mid-sized companies as measured by the ratio ""amount of investment"" - which contributed most to prevent social conflict escalation. Data set received input from in-depth interviews to managers in charge of social affairs as well as from interviews to social constituents - beneficiaries and local authorities. Content analysis supported data processing and analysis of results. Findings - Main findings comprise the following: distinct schemes for managing social responsibility in dependence upon impact evaluation indicators were found, which help to organize three models for conducting mining operations: Traditional mining, up-to-date mining, and sustainability-oriented mining; evidence of distinct pathways undergone by large- and mid-sized companies in their quest to up-scale their corporate social responsibility profile.

In an attempt to fill that void, we explore in this study whether differences in information provision through the standalone reports appear to be related to legitimacy factors. Based on a sample of 60 large companies with standalone reports issued for 2011–2012, we find that differences in the extent of social and environmental disclosure are positively related to firm size and membership in socially exposed industries, but negatively associated with status as a state-owned enterprise. In addition, we document that these relations appear to relate more strongly to disclosure of data and impact information as opposed to information on programmes and initiatives. Overall, our results suggest that CSR reporting in China, as in more developed Western economies, appears to be more about legitimation than meaningful disclosure of social and environmental performance. © 2015,h Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.",,,"Patten, D.M.; Department of Accounting, Illinois State UniversityUnited States",,"Routledge",0969160X,,,,"English","Soc.

An interview study among CSR directors of large industrial companies with high CSR ambitions was conducted in order to shed light on how CSR directors navigate this cycle of CSR innovation, CSR communication, and CSR mimicry. The findings suggest that companies should seek to foster relationship building within the organisation in order to speed up the execution of CSR ideas, build coopetitive networks for knowledge sharing with other companies, critically examine the organisation's culture, and optimise the effectiveness of CSR communication.

To this end, the authors compare the financial performance of all US corporations making up the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, being the most proactive companies in providing services and goods, while maintaining ethical responsibility and environmental sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Various performance measures are compared to the mean performance of the related industry, sector and market portfolio. We employ an analysis for several time horizons of the financial measures. Findings - Analysis by the authors suggests that firms that are proactive in supporting social responsibility and environmental sustainability (SRES corporations) are characterized by significantly higher profit measures than the industry and the sector, though not higher than the entire market. They have lower short-term liquidity measures than those of the industry and related sector, and surprisingly, their long-term leverage is significantly higher. Strong SRES corporations are characterized by significantly higher managerial efficiency ratios than the respective industry and sector. Interestingly, however, the per-worker operating efficiency ratios are significantly lower than for all of the benchmarks. Practical implications - The revealed preference of corporations can be extracted from several horizon dependent financial measures. For instance, we could infer the corporate degree of SRES from their long-term capital structure, i.e. their long-term leverages and short-term liquidity measures.

Data were collected by sending a set of questions to respondents and by interviewing them using the same set of questions if they are willing to be interviewed. Interviews were also conducted at three large companies that were once SMEs. The results indicated that SMEs in Japan emphasise seniority and treat their business like a family. SMEs in Japan value customer satisfaction do not believe in ""quick wins"" and ensure that the business is expanded progressively, not abruptly. They also believe that it is their responsibility to preserve traditional culture. The challenges that they faced included declines in sales due to the decline in foreign visits to Japan and the decreased demand for traditional products. An additional factor contributing to the success of SMEs in Japan is the Japanese government's ability to ""make the blue collars' conditions equal to the white collars conditions'"", particularly through the expanded application of the monthly payment, lifetime employment and seniority-based payment and promotion systems in SMEs, making them resemble large corporations.

We perform empirical analysis using a sample of 606 firm-year observations of Korean-listed manufacturing MNCs from 2005 to 2010. We find that ID is negatively associated with CSR, and that this relationship is stronger for chaebol firms. These results are robust after controlling for various factors that affect measurements of ID. Our findings suggest that ID related to market diversification through exports and foreign affiliates appears to push MNCs to perform fewer CSR activities in the domestic market. Our findings also indicate that the effect of chaebol firms on the relationship between ID and CSR is greater than that of non-chaebol firms in Korean market.

In addition to companies voluntarily wanting to be seen as responsible corporate citizens, the requirement for CSR reporting is being institutionalised by the King Code of Governance [King III] in South Africa. The application of King III is mandatory for all companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange [JSE], albeit on an 'apply or explain' basis. King III requires companies to not only disclose their CSR performance, but also to ensure that such disclosures have been independently assured. Irrespective of the underlying reason for companies disclosing their CSR performance and for providing independent assurance thereon, companies are moving away from simplistically applying the cliché attributed to Friedman that ""the social responsibility of business was to use its resources to engage in activities that would increase profits"". Companies that have traditionally provided financial reporting to shareholders, are now beginning to account for their non-financial performance to other stakeholders as well. This paradigm shift requires those charged with company governance and reporting (including accounting professionals usually associated with financial reporting), to re-examine their morals, values and ethical beliefs.",,,"Ackers, B.; Department of Auditing, College of Accounting Sciences, University of South Africa, UNISA, P O Box 392, South Africa",,"Sabinet",03789098,,,,"English","S.

In recent years, companies have become increasingly interested in supporting corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. While most prior research focus on the positive effect of CSR initiatives on consumer behavior, the current study identifies a new boundary condition-processing fluency-for the positive impact of CSR messaging. In addition, this examines its impact across two situations-a successful service delivery and a failure. Design/methodology/approach-This study used a 2 (processing fluency: High vs low) × 2 (service delivery: Failure vs success) scenario-based experimental design. A total of 152 adult consumers participated in this study. Findings-The results show that in the service failure condition, participants exposed to a CSR message with high processing fluency exhibited more positive attitudes and higher repurchase intentions, as compared to their counterparts in the low processing fluency condition. However, in a successful service delivery condition, participants showed similar level of attitudes and behavioral intentions across the two fluency conditions.

This article proposes a development and refinement of the explicit-implicit framework to account for, first, intranational variations of CSR, and, second, the role of individual managers in the actual process of developing CSR constructs within a given country. The specific national, institutional context, such as Norway, within which managers construct personal meaning for CSR, is ambiguous and possesses both different and potentially conflicting institutional logics of the role and responsibility of business in a given society. The author suggests that explicit and implicit models of CSR differ in two key respects. One difference concerns whether corporate or collective responsibility mechanisms should be used to address social issues. The other difference concerns whether the scope of issues to which the corporate entity is expected to attend should be broad or narrow. The author proposes four institutional models of CSR that combine the explicit-implicit distinction with these two differences: Explicit Expansionist CSR, Implicit Contractive CSR, Implicit Expansionist CSR, and Explicit Contractive CSR. Focus group interviews with Norwegian managers empirically illuminate these models and the micro-level individual construction of variable meanings for CSR within a national, institutional context. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","explicit-implicit CSR; institutional logics; managers; Norway; role of business in society",,"Blindheim, B.-T.; Department of Media, Culture and Social Sciences, University of StavangerNorway",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach – Data analysis is based on the top 100 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (2007-2011) using a 17-item CSR disclosure measure. Findings – The extent of CSR disclosure is positively associated with foreign ownership, government ownership and board independence and negatively associated with CEO duality. Promoter ownership has a negligible effect on the extent of CSR disclosure. In terms of the type of CSR disclosure, community information increases with government ownership and board independence, while environmental information expands with foreign ownership and board independence. Information on employees/ human resources has a positive association with foreign ownership but decreases with CEO duality. The amount of product and services information increases with promoter ownership, foreign ownership and board independence and CEO duality. Practical implications – Given the positive impact independent directors have on the extent of CSR disclosure, their role can be further strengthened in terms of overseeing quality of information disclosed.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors used the KLD social performance rating scores as the measure of corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance and obtained an initial sample of 38,158 firm-year observations from 1991 to 2012. The authors obtained the monthly consensus earnings forecast for fiscal year one and the monthly dispersions for these earnings forecasts from I/B/E/S, and the bond spread from DataStream database. Specifically, the authors question whether firms that exhibit CSR obtain market approval to reduce financial risk, thereby providing investors and regulators with more reliable and transparent financial information, as opposed to firms that do not meet the same criteria. Findings – The authors find that social responsible firms usually perform better in terms of their credit ratings and have lower credit risk, in terms of loan spreads when compared to corporate bond spreads, and in terms of distance to default. The results control for various measurements for CSR and time periods, consider various CSR dimensions and components, and use alternative proxies to improve the quality of financial risk estimates.

Using literature from the areas of social dilemma and reference group theory the framework suggests that the difference between the ""Yes"" and ""No"" groups will depend on certain individual factors: social value orientation, trust in others, reference group influence (i.e. in-group identity and expectation of others' cooperation), perceived efficacy, and factors that influence the costs of cooperation to the individual such as product substitutability and product preference. Using an internet sample of 468 U.S. coffee consumers, test results show that with the exception of an individual's social value orientation, all other above factors significantly differentiate between the ""Yes"" and ""No"" groups.",,,"Gupta, S.; The Pennsylvania State UniversityUnited States",,"Allied Academies",10956298,,,,"English","Acad.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors' approach involves three distinctive features. First, the authors use individual indicators of CSR to highlight which CSR dimension matters most for a firm's risk. Second, the authors distinguish CSR strengths and concerns to reveal potentially nonlinear relationships. Third, the authors use a measure of risk that takes into account the predictable changes in a firm's performance and that does not collapse the panel data into a single cross-section. This allows the CSR-risk relationship to be estimated by the variation within each firm and the variation across firms. Findings - Consistent with existing results, the authors find that CSR concerns relating to diversity, employee relations and corporate governance increase the risk to shareholders. More interestingly, the authors show that CSR strengths relating to diversity and employee relations are also associated with higher risk. The positive influence of both CSR strengths and concerns on a firm's risk is confirmed using aggregate CSR indicators. Research limitations/implications - The results confirm that CSR strengths and concerns represent distinct constructs that should not be aggregated into a single measure. The effect of poor CSR on firm risk is more significant than what would appear to be the case using an aggregate index. Practical implications - Although lack of CSR engagement may not affect (and may even benefit) a firm's current performance, it may seriously damage its performance in the future. Firms should be aware of this risk. Originality/value - The positive relationship found between CSR and firm risk underscores the inherent conflict between the interests of employees and those of shareholders. By committing to a more favorable treatment of their employees, firms incur a fixed cost that inevitably transfers more risk to their shareholders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited, ISSN 1747-1117.","CSR; Firm risk; Social responsibility; Stakeholders support",,"Nguyen, P.; Faculty of Business School, University of Technology SydneyAustralia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

This article shifts the conceptual and empirical focus to investigate the conditions under which intentional profit-seeking through corporate social action projects can create economic value for the firm. The article uses resource-dependency theory and the resource-based view to define the firm’s external and internal environments respectively. From that perspective, the article looks at how corporate social action creates economic value through strategic social planning and strategic social positioning. A survey instrument was developed and applied to 110 large Spanish firms. In that sample, munificence and continuous innovation positively affect social positioning, while nongovernmental organization salience and social responsibility orientation positively affect social planning. Both social positioning and social planning in turn contribute to corporate ability to create value.

Previous research on CSR in Europe has made few attempts to identify stakeholders and their contribution to this topic. Design/methodology/approach - To derive this map, publicly available documents were explored, augmented by 27 interviews with key stakeholders (consumers, media, government, trade unions, non-profit organisations [NPOs], banks, certifiers and consultants) and management of different companies (multinational enterprises [MNEs], small- and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] and large national companies). Using MAXQDA, the quantified codes given for power, legitimacy and urgency were triangulated between self-reporting, external assessments and statements from publicly available documents and subsequently transferred into stakeholder priorities or, in other words, into positions in the map. Further, the codes given in the interviews for different CSR interests and the results from the document analysis were linked between stakeholders. The identified concerns and priorities were quantitatively analysed in regard to centrality and salience using VennMaker. Findings - The paper identified SMEs, MNEs and cooperating NPOs as being the most significant stakeholders, in that order. CSR is, therefore, not driven primarily by regulators, market pressure or customers. Further network parameters substantiated the importance of SMEs while following an unconventionally informal and idiosyncratic CSR approach. Hence, insights into these ethics-driven, unformalised business models that pursue broader responsibility based on trust, traditional values, regional anchors and the willingness to ""give something back"" were formed. Examples of this strong CSR habit include democratic decisions and abolished hierarchies, handshake instead of formal contracts and transparency in all respects (e.g. performance indicators, salaries and bonuses). Research limitations/implications - In total, 27 interviews as primary data that supplements publicly available documents are clearly only indicative. Practical implications - The research found an innovative, vibrant and practical CSR model that is emerging for reasons other than conventional CSR agendas that are supposed to evolve. In fact, the stakeholder map and the CSR practices may point at a very different role businesses have adopted in Switzerland. Such models offer a useful, heuristic evaluation of the contribution of formal management systems (e.g. as could be found in MNEs) in comparison to the unformalised SME business conduct. Originality/value - A rarely reported and astonishing feature of many of the very radical SME practices found in this study is that their link to commercial strategies was, in most cases, not seen. However, SMEs are neither the ""poor relative"" nor the abridged version of CSR, but are manifesting CSR as a Swiss set of values that fits the societal culture and the visionary goals of SME owners/managers and governs how a sustainably responsible company should behave. Hence, as a new stance and argument within CSR-related research, this paper concludes that ""informal"" does not mean ""weak"". This paper covers a myriad of management fields, e.g. CSR as strategic tool in business ethics; stakeholder and network management; decision-making; and further theoretical frameworks, such as transaction cost and social capital theory. In other words, this research closes scientific gaps by at once applying quantitative as well as qualitative methods and by merging, for the first time, network methodology with CSR and stakeholder research. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Network analysis; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Stakeholder analysis; Switzerland",,"Looser, S.; Centre for Environmental Strategy, CES, University of SurreyUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Two types of environmental practices are distinguished: practices related to production processes (greening processes) and practices related to products and services (greening product and service offerings). Despite a growing literature on socially responsible behavior of large firms, the role of SMEs remains underexposed. This neglect is remarkable given the substantial impact of SMEs on the economy and the natural environment. By using unique data for almost 8,000 SMEs across 12 sectors in 36 countries, we study the influence of firm characteristics on SMEs’ environmental behavior. Our results suggest that different characteristics have dissimilar influences on both types of environmental practices such as the type of customers served. Stringent environmental legislation encourages firms to actively take on environmental activities, but only in case of green products and services. Moreover, the dominant idea that small firms are reluctant to invest in environmental practices is clearly more nuanced: firm size matters most for engagement in greening processes. Finally, SMEs active in tangible sectors and that receive financial support are more involved in either type of environmental practices. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental practice; Eurobarometer; SME; Stakeholder theory",,"Hoogendoorn, B.; Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University Rotterdam, P.O.

This study builds on prior research by examining the nonfinancial information preferences of professional investors, how their demand for the nonfinancial information categories compares to those of nonprofessional investors, and whether these demands vary across subgroups of professional investors. Based on survey responses from 228 professional investors, the results show that this investor class prefers nonfinancial information that is concise, comprehensive, comparable, and credible. Similar to prior research, the results indicate that professional and nonprofessional investors have similar demand orderings: they are most interested in economic information, then governance information, and then CSR information. However, professional investors demand greater detail than do nonprofessional investors for subcategories of economic and governance information. Further, while both professional and nonprofessional investors’ demand is increasing for all subcategories of governance and CSR information, the change in demand is more pronounced for nonprofessional relative to professional investors, and particularly for CSR information subcategories. These variations in preferences suggest potential differences in perspectives between professional and nonprofessional investors. Finally, the findings indicate that institutional investors have recently used less economic information. For the subgroups whose investment research consists of at least a quarter of socially responsible investments (SRI), the higher the SRI investor level, the higher the recent usage of more information categories, and the higher the SRI investor level, the higher the future demand foreconomic information, but the lower the SRI investor level, and the higher the demand for CSR information. These findings suggest potential differences in investment approaches among subgroups of professional investors. Together, these results provide support for more integrated reporting of nonfinancial information to meet professional investors’ multidimensional preferences and differences in demand relative to those of nonprofessional investors. © 2015, American Accounting Association.

Specifically, we examine whether a potential measurement problem of CSR score measured by KEJI (Korea Economic Justice Institute) index affects the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP). The empirical results regarding the relationship between CSR and CFP in prior studies have been inconsistent. Although some studies (e.g. Waddock & Graves, 1997) point out that the potential measurement problem of CSR score is likely to be an important factor to resolve the issue of mixed results, CSR measurement problem to date draws little attention from researchers particularly in Korea setting. We suspect that prior studies that report positive relationship between CSR and CFP using KEJI index is biased upward due to potential measurement problem of KEJI index that includes operating performance component. To examine this issue, we employ an adjusted CSR score which excludes operating performance component included in the unadjusted CSR score to mitigate measurement problem that can show a positive upward bias in the relationship between CSR and CFP in the prior studies. We employ the sample data of 1,301 firm-year observations of manufacturing firms listed in Korea Stock Price Index (KOSPI) market during 2005-2010. Using adjusted CSR score, we find that the positive CSR-CFP relationship significantly weakens compared to unadjusted CSR score. This result remains robust after we perform various sensitivity tests. This study suggests that CSR measurements problem is likely to distort the relationship between CSR and CFP in Korea setting.

It explains how some of the EU’s member states are ratifying the EU Commission’s directives on ESG reporting by introducing intelligent, substantive and reflexive regulations. Design/methodology/approach – Following a review of EU publications and relevant theoretical underpinnings, this paper reports on the EU member states’ national policies for ESG reporting and disclosures. Findings – The EU has recently revised a number of tools and instruments for the reporting of financial and non-financial information, including the EU’s modernisation directive, the EU’s directive on the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information, the EU Energy Efficiency Directive, the European pollutant release and transfer register, the EU emission trading scheme, the integrated pollution prevention and control directive, among others. Practical implications – Although all member states are transposing these new EU directives, to date, there are no specific requirements in relation to the type of non-financial indicators that can be included in annual reports. Moreover, there is a need for further empirical evidence that analyse how these regulations may (or may not) affect government entities and big corporations. Social implications – Several EU countries are integrating reporting frameworks that require the engagement of relevant stakeholders (including shareholders) to foster a constructive environment that may lead to continuous improvements in ESG disclosures. Originality/value – EU countries are opting for a mix of voluntary and mandatory measures that improve ESG disclosures in their respective jurisdictions. This contribution indicates that there is scope for national governments to give further guidance to civil society and corporate business to comply with the latest EU developments in ESG reporting. When European entities respond to regulatory pressures, they are also addressing ESG and economic deficits for the benefit of all stakeholders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability and responsibility; CSR reporting; ESG; EU CSR policy; EU Modernisation Directive; Global Compact; Global reporting initiative; Sustainability reporting; UN Global Compact",,"Camilleri, M.A.; Department of Corporate Communications, University of MaltaMalta",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20408021,,,,"English","Sustainability Account.

However, the majority of research emanates from the fields of finance and management, with very little coming from the field of ethics. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by answering the question: Does the IPO process change a companys ethical culture? In order to answer this question we examined S-1 filings made by companies before they went public. We used text-mining techniques to identify words that are uniquely related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) in those filings. We then used linear regression to compare those word counts to data produced by CSRHub. Companies that include words related to CSR tend to score better on various CSR measures. This evidence can support several explanatory theories, such as companies that take the time and effort to discuss CSR concepts in their S-1s make ethics a priority and therefore score higher on CSR ratings. Similarly, companies that had never formally thought about their ethical culture might feel, under the pressure of an IPO, to think about what kind of company the owners and leadership want it to be in the long run. Our study only analyzed companies three years post-IPO and did not control for certain variables. This paper is the first of its kind to discuss and, more importantly, attempt to quantify the impact of the IPO process on a companys ethical culture. We hope that by understanding how the IPO process influences companies in terms of ethics, companies can more easily develop and maintain ethical cultures pre- and post-IPO. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","corporate social responsibility; Ethics; IPOs; S-1 filings",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",10484736,,,,"English","Adv.

Design/methodology/approach – Content analysis of international banks’ web-sites and CSR reports. Findings – As expected, CSR disclosure scores of international banks in 2013 were significantly larger than in 2005. Despite addressing the legitimacy gap after the 2008 crisis, significant room for improvements remained in the context of sustainable products, implementation of environmental management policies and introduction of CSR initiatives (the latter especially for Northern American banks). Although the transnational context had contributed to the gradual convergence of CSR disclosure scores, the existence of differing national and organisational contexts had maintained some of the diversity across banks. Research limitations/implications – Content analysis approach used limits the possibilities to objectively grasp the depth of CSR and the sample remains biased towards larger international banks headquartered in Europe. Practical implications – Stakeholders should remain vary of “window-dressing” attempts and reward only those banks that actually contribute to the society.

Dixon School of Accounting, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States; Wallace D.M., Kenneth G. Dixon School of Accounting, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States","During its relatively brief, 40-year life as a recognized field of inquiry (Owen, 2008), research in social and environmental accounting (SEA) has witnessed its fair share of struggles within both the mainstream and critical accounting literature. Only recently, the elite mainstream academic journals in the United States have (re)discovered SEA-related work on corporate social responsibility, and in a vast majority of that work, earlier SEA studies are either not acknowledged (e.g., Elliott, Jackson, Peecher, & White, 2014) or are dismissed as irrelevant to the discussion at hand (e.g., Moser & Martin, 2012). Critical accounting research has been more welcoming generally to SEA topics, although there has been near constant tension between the reformist approach taken in many SEA studies and the more radical tenor understandably present in critical research (e.g., Spence, 2009; Tinker et al., 1991). At certain points in the development of SEA research, common ground has been found (Tinker & Gray, 2003). Grappling with these dilemmas seems especially acute for quantitative SEA work that follows an objectivist/positivist research tradition, often facing increasing methodological hurdles from the elite mainstream, and/or a rejection of fundamental assumptions by critical theorists.The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we offer support for sustaining diversity in SEA research by discussing the potential for quantitative SEA research projects to substantively challenge mainstream conceptions of SEA. Second, in order to promote quantitative SEA research we present a literature review that informs current and potential quantitative SEA scholars of recent developments in this stream of research, focusing primarily on the methodological requirements present in related mainstream quantitative research. Although admittedly partial and selective in its presentation, through this commentary we aim to promote continued support of quantitative SEA research within the critical accounting community and to help enable non-mainstream quantitative SEA researchers to disarm methodological criticisms from elite mainstream sources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental accounting; Quantitative research; Social accounting; Sustainability",,"Roberts, R.W.; Kenneth G.

Our study provides implications for global regulators and policymakers when setting social reporting standards, suggesting that institutional and/or cultural factors affect top management's social reporting behavior and regional investors' impressions of CSR value. In particular, the Asian regulators should effectively promote public understanding and awareness of CSR information. Additionally, our findings may be informative to international managers and investors when considering CSR as an indicator in their internal governance designation and decision-making. Firms should carefully evaluate the risk of CSR investing and its effect on equity financing in different regions. © 2015 University of Illinois.","Corporate social responsibility; Cost of equity capital; Global perspective",,"Huang, H.-W.; College of Management, National Cheng Kung University, 1 University Rd., Taiwan",,"Elsevier Ltd",00207063,,,,"English","Int.

It identifies the organizational impression management tactics that companies use in sustainability reporting. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative template analysis of two sustainability reports was conducted to inductively identify the organizational impression management tactics that companies use in sustainability reporting. Findings - The study identified eight organizational impression management tactics used in sustainability reporting, four of which relate to how companies present their actions while the remaining four are characteristic of the writing styles that companies use. Research limitations/implications - The study is exploratory in nature and does not claim to identify all existing impression management tactics. Therefore, future research is needed to confirm the results and identify possible additional tactics. Practical implications - Companies can use impression management tactics that more strongly aim to shape the impressions that stakeholders hold or tactics that more neutrally inform stakeholders of their actions. Companies need to make a choice between the two, considering that stakeholders' expectations of sustainability reporting would be useful.

More specifically, this paper proposed and tested a theoretical model that examined whether recognizing the ulterior motive caused consumer skepticism about hotels’ environmental claims, which in turn influenced consumers’ intention to participate in linen reuse program and intention to revisit the hotel. Additionally, the moderating effects of ecological concern on the relationship between skepticism and intention to participate and between skepticism and intention to revisit were examined. Design/methodology/approach – A quasi-experimental design was used with two conditions (control vs ulterior motive) employing staff members of a US public university as study participants. In total, 638 useful responses were received. Findings – The results of this study revealed that an ulterior motive of hotels’ environmental claims evoked consumer skepticism, which, in turn, negatively influenced consumers’ intention to participate in the linen reuse program and intention to revisit the hotel. Skepticism was found to partially mediate the relationships between ulterior motive and intention to participate and between ulterior motive and intention to revisit. Consumers’ ecological concern was not found to moderate the relationship between skepticism and intention to participate in the linen reuse program and skepticism and intention to revisit the hotel. In addition, a significant positive direct effect between ecological concern and intention to participate and a non-significant effect between ecological concern and revisit intention were revealed. Research limitations/implications – Focus on consumers’ response to the ulterior motive of environmental claims advances an understanding of consumers’ attitudes and perceptions about hotels’ green practices. Practical implications – Findings suggest that hotels need to be watchful so that consumers do not become skeptical. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that managers do everything possible to give customers no room for doubt. Hoteliers need to spend more effort in installing comprehensive green programs and make true green claims by keeping the potential consequences of greenwashing in mind. Hoteliers also need to seek out third-party certifications that require the hotel to meet certain standards, which will help ensure credibility in the eyes of consumers. Originality/value – Hospitality literature has seldom explored this gray area of green marketing, and, in this regard, this study serves as a guide to hoteliers and researchers alike. The authors thereby anticipate that this study would encourage more research in this often overlooked but highly important area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental concerns; Green hotel; Greenwashing; Skepticism; Sustainability",,"Chi, C.G.-Q.; School of Hospitality Business Management, Carlson College of Business, Washington State UniversityUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09596119,,,,"English","Int.

Green demarketing refers to a strategy whereby a brand encourages consumers to buy less at the category level through purchase of the company’s brand for the sake of the environment. Two studies show that consumer motive attributions and attitudes may depend on the brand’s perceived fit with sustainable business practices. Specifically, results show that the brand’s environmental reputation is the strongest predictor of consumers’ responses towards a green demarketing campaign, with effects persisting above and beyond the influences of the brand’s length of commitment to environmental protection and consumers’ brand habits.

Responses provide data on consumers' awareness of CSR initiatives, attitudes toward the company, perceived company uniqueness, emotional response, and attributions of company motives to engage in CSR activities. Rational appeals more effectively communicate environment-related CSR initiatives, whereas emotional appeals more effectively communicate employee-based CSR initiatives. Effects on consumers' attributions of company motives to engage in CSR are significant in both service types.

Results suggest that engagement with companies may threaten NPO legitimacy by challenging core values and identity traits. Due to power asymmetries in favor of the company, the legitimacy risk is particularly serious for integrative partnerships compared with philanthropic and transactional partnerships. This condition is paradoxical, because integrative partnerships are praised for their greater societal impact and ability to generate joint innovations.

The analysis brings together four main approaches to chains and network studies - supply chain management (SCM), global commodity chains (GCC), global value chains (GVCs) and global production networks (GPNs) - to examine how and the extent to which sustainability and sustainability governance are conceptualised and incorporated into their analytical frameworks. The results point to a shift in this combined literature from conceptualising the formation of global chains and networks as sites of inequality under conditions of globalisation, towards a renewed vision on the potential of chains as a site for social and environmental reform. Overall, however, we conclude that the literature on global chains and networks has not adequately conceptualised distinct modes of sustainability governance.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the efficacy of four CSR initiatives - regulatory compliance, green cause-related marketing (CRM), green product, and a combination of green CRM and green product - on consumer attitude and purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach - An experiment is conducted to investigate how consumers in an emerging Asian market like Thailand respond to different environmental CSR tactics. Findings - The results of this study demonstrate that a specific environmental CSR strategy elicits more favorable response than a general approach of complying with regulations. In addition, engaging in green CRM and offering a green product concurrently is perceived as more appealing than employing only either of the two strategies. The key finding is that in the eyes of Thai consumers, green CRM and green product CSR initiatives are substitutable. Originality/value - The paper conceptualizes the difference between four environmental CSR strategies from dimensions of the firm's discretion and commitment level and highlights the importance of using specific voluntary environmental CSR strategies over involuntary regulatory compliance. Firms are recommended to engage in either green CRM or green product initiatives. The choice depends on a firm's resources and opportunities. The addition of green CSR initiatives increases the positive impact on consumer attitude and purchase intention. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cause-related marketing; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental marketing; Environmental-friendly product; Green marketing; Green product",,"Sony, A.; School of Management, Asian Institute of TechnologyThailand",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17574323,,,,"English","Asia-Pac.

We investigate consumers' acceptance of price increases justified by higher costs due to company's corporate socially responsible activities by conducting two experimental studies. In the first study we examine perceived fairness and intentions following a price increase justified by a fair trade commitment. To assess the green attitude-behavior gap in consumer behavior our second study incorporates a real world experiment to explore actual consumer behavior against stated intentions. Our investigation adds nuance to our understanding of the effects of corporate social responsibility on consumer response to price increases. Our results reveal that a price increase due to a fair trade commitment is perceived as fair and does not have a negative impact on purchase behavior. We contrast our findings with a price increase due to higher taxes and due to profit increase. Our results demonstrate that fair trade justified price increases can skim twice the amount compared to tax justified increases. Furthermore, consumers' actual buying behavior reveals no difference to their stated intentions. Hence, prior research proclaiming an attitude-behavior gap in the context of consumers' socially responsible buying behavior has to be called into question. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attitude-behavior gap; Corporate social responsibility; Experiment; Fair trade commitment; Price fairness; Price increase","consumption behavior; experimental study; marketing; perception; price dynamics; retailing; trade relations","Heinrich, D.; Department of Services Management, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Mühlenpfordtstr. 23, Germany",,"Elsevier Ltd",09696989,,,,"English","J.

We study the implementation of 25 practices, associated with three corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues in 101 worldwide subsidiaries of a multinational enterprise (MNE). Consistent with the idea that attention is limited and therefore selective, we find that external peers' conformity to the CSR norm directs subsidiaries' attention toward the CSR-related demands of external constituents at the expense of the demands from the headquarters. However, internal peers' conformity increases attention to both external and headquarters' demands related to CSR. As higher attention levels result in higher practice implementation, internal and external peers' conformity drives the heterogeneity of practice implementation in the MNE. Our results suggest the need to rethink the influence of peers' conformity on subsidiaries' implementation of practices, as it not only triggers mimicry based on legitimacy but also and simultaneously a more strategic response based on internal and external competitive threats and attention allocation.","attention; corporate social responsibility; institutional theory; multinational corporations (MNCs) and enterprises (MNEs); practice implementation; simultaneous equation modeling",,"Jacqueminet, A.; Department of Management and Technology, Bocconi University, via Roentgen 1, Italy",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",00472506,,,,"English","J.

We argue that schools may be unable to match rising institutional pressures to publicly commit to responsible management education with their limited internal capacity for change. Our analysis proposes that decoupling is likely if schools (a) are exposed to resource stringency, (b) face overt or covert resistance against change processes, (c) are confronted with competing institutional pressures, and (d) perceive institutional demands as ambiguous. We discuss two implications of this proposition. On one hand, decoupling can cause dissonant legitimacy perceptions, leading to cynicism around responsible management education within business schools. On the other hand, a temporary inconsistency between talk and action may help schools to articulate future ambitions for responsible management education, which, over time, could inspire recoupling effects. © The Author(s) 2015.","corporate social responsibility; decoupling; Principles for Responsible Management Edcuation (PRME); responsible management education",,"Rasche, A.; CBS Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility (cbsCSR), Copenhagen Business School, Porcelænshaven 18A, Denmark",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",10564926,,,,"English","J.

The bulk of the current research on CSR and crisis examined the role of CSR as an asset in a crisis. CSR as crisis risk is a direct function of CSR’s increasingly important role in reputation management. CSR has become an important aspect of corporate reputations – it is one of the dimensions used to assess a corporation’s crisis. The value of CSR to reputations is illustrated in the Rep Trak reputation measure from the Reputation Institute and the value it places upon CSR. If stakeholders can challenge CSR claims by arguing a corporation is acting irresponsibly, the stakeholders can erode the corporation’s reputational assets by creating a challenge crisis. A CSR-based challenge occurs when stakeholders redefine a corporation’s current practices as irresponsible. The CSR-based challenge can be risk because it can damage reputational assets and potentially escalate into a crisis. CSR becomes a leverage point for stakeholders seeking to engage in a challenge crisis. As corporations place more value on the CSR dimension of reputation, CSR-based challenge becomes an increasingly powerful leverage point. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is conceptual with an emphasis on theory building. Findings – The manuscript details the CSR-based challenge process. It examines the nature of CSR-based challenges, how they can become threats to corporations, and how corporations can respond to the threats. There is also an explanation of how CSR-based challenges indicate the shift to private politics/social issues management and the implications of this shift for advancing a neoliberal perspective. Practical implications – CSR and crises have a much more complex relationship than current research has identified. CSR can be a crisis risk, not just an asset used to protect a reputation during a crisis. CSR can be the reason a crisis exists and threats a corporation – it is a crisis risk. The primary manifestation of CSR as a crisis risk is the challenge crisis premised on social irresponsibility, what the authors term the CSR-based challenge crisis. This paper will detail the process whereby CSR is transformed from a crisis resource to a crisis threat. The end result of this analysis will be set of insights into CSR-based challenge crises. These insights can help stakeholders seeking to create social change through a challenge and corporate managers seeking to address a challenge crisis. Social implications – Challenge crises are an example of private politics/social issues management, when stakeholders seek to create changes in corporate behavior by engaging the organization directly rather than through public policy efforts. The paper offers insights into how social issues management can work to create social change by altering problematic corporate behaviors. Originality/value – There is limited research into CSR as a crisis risk and in understanding how challenge crises help to create social change. This paper will provide new insights into CSR as a crisis risk, challenge crises, and private politics. Ideas from public relations, corporate communication, and political communication will be fused to create a novel framework for illuminating these related topics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Challenge; Corporate social responsibility; Crisis; Private politics; Reputation management; Risk management",,"Coombs, T.; Nicholson School of Communication, University of Central FloridaUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13563289,,,,"English","Corp.

Any progress that the organization makes depends fundamentally on the capabilities, perceptions, training and mindset of the CEO. The research results reinforce several key topics suggested in the literature on institutional theory. Particularly, we have proposed a classification with the motives that give rise to institutional initiatives: institutional authority; advantage in management; and, social involvement. This classification is consistent, to a larger extend, to the pillars of institutionalization that have been defined in the institutional theory literature, helping to understand, in more detail, the origin of the business processes and the background or motivations that generates and guide them.","Corporate social responsibility; Institutional initiative; Institutional theory; Institutionalization; Management motivation",,,,"Institute of Applied Business Economics",11316837,,,,"Spanish","Cuad.

The benefits of partnering flow to everyone involved, i.e., the cooperative itself, its employees, the people in the various countries in the Base of the Pyramid, and supporting infrastructure from the partnerships, i.e., USAID, ENGINE, and VEGA. Land O'Lakes is successful in building realities for people becoming self-sufficient in countries such as Ethiopia and Afghanistan. The case enables faculty to direct students to discover effective strategies in partnering with various organizations in enabling people in the BoP to improve their standards of living. Case Synopsis: Caroline Tetrick, a Sales Representative for Land O'Lakes, finds herself with an exciting opportunity but doesn't know enough to make a life-changing decision.

Faced with a deteriorating global environment, both corporations and regulatory bodies have become more responsive to environmental conservation problems. However, existing literature has not adequately addressed the question of whether and how firms’ business activities influence the environment. Design/methodology/approach – Using the daily air pollution indices of 120 Chinese cities from 2001 to 2012, this study found that air pollution is alleviated after firms’ initial public offerings (IPOs). This paper proposes that firms’ IPOs influence the ambient air pollution through three channels: production scale, technical reform and corporate governance effects. Findings – The authors of this study found that the proceeds acquired in IPOs result in enlarged production scales that increase pollution, while the investment of these proceeds in social responsibility-related technical reform and enhanced corporate governance reduce pollution. Moreover, the authors discover that firms with a higher state ownership emit fewer pollutants, thus supporting the positive monitoring role of the Chinese government. Originality/value – Although this study investigates the impact of IPOs on air quality in China, the proposed analytical framework also applies to studies of other financing activities in global markets. This study has important policy implications for government regulations in environmental controls. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Air pollution; Chinese firms; Corporate social responsibility; IPO",,"Ren, J.; Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of MacauChina",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",15587894,,,,"English","J.

The idea of social license to operate is closely linked to ideas of stakeholder power, legitimacy and urgency (Mitchell et al., 1997). But what if a community is impoverished, and lacks the tools and privileges to effect change? Do the stakeholders believe they have influence over extension of the social license to operate? Does the employer listen to them? To examine this issue, survey data was gathered from 12,000 stakeholders working in a poor township in South Africa. The township is located near a major South African city in an employment market dominated by a single heavy industry. Responders perceived their welfare to be of importance to the employer and that they had a role in extension of the social license to operate. Design/methodology/approach – A survey of 12,000 employees working in an impoverished township near a large South African city. Findings – Despite being impoverished and lacking the tools and privileges to effect change that are available in wealthier communities, responders perceived some influence over extension of social license to operate. Research limitations/implications – While responders expressed clear sentiments, their actual power to extend or withhold social license to operate is unclear, and the study did not test for this. Practical implications – The practical implication is that firms should be wary of assuming that just because a stakeholder group is impoverished, it is unaware of its role and power as a stakeholder. Social implications – The more important implication is that under conditions of poverty, responders expressed a clear desire to see impediments to work removed, rather than a desire for handouts. Originality/value – The authors doubt there has ever been a study of this kind with this large a sample, in conditions of such extreme poverty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Social license to operate; Stakeholder theory",,"McIntyre, M.L.; Eric Sprott School of Business, Carleton UniversityCanada",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

The empirical evidence from two studies suggests that retailers should consider the type of PLB (i.e. quality tier) in the introduction of social responsibility initiatives. Design/methodology/approach – To investigate opposing predictions, the authors conducted two experiments with presence of social responsibility initiative and PLB quality tier as the factors. The authors present the results from 168 Canadian consumers focussing on two product categories. Findings – The findings of two experiments are more consistent with an explanation based on resource synergy beliefs rather than costly signaling theory. Social responsibility initiatives enhanced consumer evaluations of high-quality PLBs, but hurt consumer evaluations of low-tier PLBs. Practical implications – Retailers should differentiate the way they accommodate social responsibility initiatives based on the type of their PLBs. Specifically, the beneficial effect of social responsibility initiative only exist for high-tier PLBs. Introducing social responsibility initiatives may hurt preference for low-tier PLBs. Originality/value – This paper is the first to propose two theoretical models that address how social responsibility initiatives can affect consumer evaluations of PLBs.

In the process, the authors utilize data on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports (in particular, information disclosure) and equity capital (focusing on cost). The overarching hypothesis may be phrased simply as: is CSR reporting rewarded by the capital market in China? Design/methodology/approach – The data of 3,012 list corporations in China securities are used and 1,015 CSR report quality scores (Rankins CSR Ratings) are hand-gathered from HEXUN (Web site) and utilized in the process of developing the model; financial and stock market information is obtained from the Wind database and the China Stock Market and Accounting Research database. Findings – The authors’ results suggest that overall the quality of CSR report is strongly, negatively related with the cost of capital: the higher the quality of social responsibility information disclosure, the lower the cost of equity capital. Most intriguingly, the authors find a sharp contrast between the government-owned corporations (state-owned enterprises) and privately owned, listed corporations. The quality of CSR reporting has a much higher impact in lowering the cost of equity capital for privately owned corporations. In contrasting the results for mandatory versus voluntary CSR disclosure, the quality of CSR reporting for the latter does not have any higher impact in lowering the cost of equity. Practical implications – Good social responsibility behavior by corporations and their subsequent information disclosure has beneficial financial impacts. In the authors’ research, the authors showed its immediate impact to be in the lowering of the overall corporate cost of equity. In this regard, the authors would recommend that chief executive officers pay more attention to CSR practice and its disclosure. Private firms issuing CSR reports will benefit from much lower financing costs through the capital market. Originality/value – Due to the structure of capital markets in China, the authors are able to show that CSR reporting of privately owned, listed corporations have much more effective signaling power. On the basis of the authors’ empirical findings in relation to the quality of CSR reporting and its impact on cost of capital, the authors suggest there is greater scope for research which takes a “finance and society” perspective. Based on more extensive research, such a perspective may enable scholars to orientate finance and finance research toward a model of “socio-capitalism”. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Cost of equity; Information disclosure",,"Li, Y.; School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiaotong UniversityChina",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1750614X,,,,"English","Chin.

By studying technology exporters, we unveil circumstances where firms can benefit from higher innovation due to the presence of CSR principles. The findings reveal that while CSR contributes to enhance the impact of exploratory innovation on export performance, there is a detrimental impact on the effect of exploitative innovation on export performance.

Employees often feel conflict among different aspects of their lives. Although most extant research has focused on the effect of family values on work attitudes, we investigate whether a fit between employees' socially responsible consumption orientation (SRCO) and firm corporate social responsibility (CSR) influences employee higher-order quality of work life. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data from 112 members of an engineering association in Australia. Findings - The results show that employees' consumer life roles can influence their work-related perceptions. However, contrary to expectations, the positive influence of CSR on higher-order quality of work life is weaker for employees who are more socially responsible consumers. Research limitations/implications - Further research should examine other industry contexts and cultures. Also, because the SRCO construct is very broad, further research should examine specific social issues. Practical implications - CSR can be an important strategy for retaining employees, even those with lower SRCO. Originality/value - This research shows that customer values influence important work-related attitudes, such as higher-order quality of work life and organizational commitment. Furthermore, we show that ""fit"" between consumption orientation responsibility and firm CSR does not necessarily enhance work-related attitudes because employees high in SRCO likely hold the firm to a different standard of social responsibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Person-organization fit; Quality of work life; Socially responsible consumption orientation",,"Arndt, A.D.; Department of Marketing, Old Dominion UniversityUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Based on legitimation theory and stakeholder theory, we regard the voluntary activities of firms as having long-run effective characteristics that can be applied to industry in general. The environmental behavior of firms is represented by CDP activity, while the DJSI represents their sustainable activities. Based on the assumption that corporate environmentalism is a bilateral agreement between policymakers and firms, we answer four specific research questions. (i) What is the relation between voluntary activities and performance of firms? (ii) Do firms' voluntary activities in environmental and sustainable implementations induce innovation? (iii) How does the nature of innovation depend on voluntary type of the firms? (iv) What is the link between firm characteristics and innovation according to voluntary types?

Design/methodology/approach – Econometric models have been estimated, with an index of CSR as the dependent variable, and ownership concentration as the explanatory variable, together with relevant control variables suggested in the literature (profitability, leverage, growth opportunities, and firm size). A Brazilian CSR database has been built using data extracted from two different sources, one relative to CSR data and another that provides ownership structure and financial data. CSR policy is proxied by an index obtained as the ratio between funds directed to social action (employee relations, external social actions, and environmental action) and net sales. Findings – The findings indicate that CSR is positively influenced by firm ownership concentration in Brazil. Practical implications – The positive influence of ownership concentration on CSR may be an indication that large controlling shareholders of Brazilian firm may be considering CSR as an effective way to improve the image and reputation of the firm and its owners. This belief may be stimulating CSR projects and their disclosure in Brazil.

This study contributes to the existing CSR and IB literature in three ways. First, it integrates and systematizes the factors influencing CSR-based strategies into the three categories represented by the legs of the strategy tripod to help elucidate the previous research on the factors that drive CSR. Second, it suggests that exporters’ CSR strategies can be affected by social and environmental institutions based outside their home countries.

These complexities and hazards make knowledge for understanding chemical properties and management practices at multiple nodes central to the responsible management of textile supply chains. This study investigates the knowledge requirements of, and the knowledge strategies used by, textile procuring organisations in response to both external stakeholders and internal pressure. Based on a qualitative study of small and medium-sized Swedish textile procuring organisations, the paper describes these knowledge challenges and analyses how efforts to meet them relate to expressed commitments and capabilities for responsible supply chain management (RSCM), as well as to organisational characteristics (i.e. whether the organisation is private or public, small or large, and whether textiles is a core or peripheral activity). It was found that several textile procuring organisations expressed commitment towards achieving RSCM. However, most organisations felt that they lacked capacity to rise to the challenge. There was a poor state of knowledge regarding many chemical substances and inherent difficulties in gaining knowledge of chemical risks and how to manage these. Moreover, the input of knowledge was limited and based on only a few key sources. Such factors proved to be obstacles for procuring organisations when attempting to facilitate responsible management upstream in complex supply chains. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Chemical risks; Corporate social responsibility; Knowledge; Responsible procurement","Chemical hazards; Economic and social effects; Hazards; Industrial chemicals; Societies and institutions; Textiles; Chemical risks; Complex supply chain; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); External stakeholders; Knowledge; Knowledge challenges; Knowledge requirements; Responsible procurement; Supply chain management","Börjeson, N.; School of Natural Sciences, Technology and Environmental Studies, Södertörn University, Alfred Nobels Allé 7, Sweden",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors’ paper analyzes the link between the ratings of CSR of the largest publicly traded Canadian firms (i.e. those included in the S&P/TSX 60 index) and the traits of their boards. Findings – The authors’ examination concludes that the CSR score is positively linked with the percentages of women and independent directors. The study did not find a link in the cases of board characteristics, namely, director’s remuneration, director’s tenure and director’s ownership. Research limitations/implications – The study focuses on the 60 largest public Canadian firms, which are strongly scrutinized. An analysis that includes smaller firms as well may show different results. Practical implications – To improve the ability of boards of directors to deal with CSR, the appointment of women and independent directors should be given greater emphasis. Data show that all boards in their sample are composed of at least 50 per cent of independent directors, with an average of 80 per cent. Thus, there is a more limited room to ameliorate CSR by adding independent directors. In contrast, women represented, on average, only 14.25 per cent of all directors. Companies wanting to improve their CSR should consider appointing more female participation in their boards.

The study also examines differences in the financial and productivity performance among B-Corps based on their scores on qualitative CSR performance factors. These measurements add to the discussion as to whether or not stronger CSR performance is associated with stronger financial performance and whether productivity increases in this type of firm. One finding is that B-Corps had a statistically significant revenue growth rate that outpaced the average revenue growth of the public companies that operate in the same 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code as B-Corps.

However, few studies have examined the combined effect of implementing environmental management practices and corporate social responsibility practices in the tourism sector. By analysing two surveys conducted with the managers of 370 hotels and 176 restaurants and using structural equations, this study concludes that sustainability practices have a direct and significant impact on the company's competitiveness and on the companies' financial results. However, a separate study of the two surveys shows significant differences between the two analysed groups. This article suggests that despite operating in the same sector, hotels and restaurants behave differently regarding sustainability practices, and they achieve significantly different results in their implementation.

In particular, the authors want to investigate: Which firms act faster in disaster relief giving?Howdo late movers react? In the end, which firms donate most at the competitive equilibrium, first or late movers? Whether and how firm visibility will affect the relationships proposed based on the former three questions?

Then, linear regression analysis is conducted to identify the competition between first movers and late movers. Findings – The authors find that large firms and firms with a high financial performance tend to be first movers in disaster relief giving. Late movers donate amounts that are similar to those of first movers in both absolute and relative value. But first movers donate more in absolute value than late movers in the whole process of giving. Firm visibility strengthens the effect of financial performance (return on assets) on giving timing, but weakens the effect of giving timing on both first round and total giving amount.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines comprising assessments of economic, ecological and social aspects are one of the most comprehensive CSR frameworks applied widely also in forest industries. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate, how the GRI guidelines encompass cultural sustainability when assessing forestry and forest industry operations in a global context and to recognize the cultural sustainability themes that need additional information in forest industry companies’ CSR reporting. Design/methodology/approach – In the qualitative analysis, expert interview material on indicators identified for assessing the cultural sustainability of forest bioenergy production in North Karelia was compared with the contents of the GRI guidelines. The focus on classifying the cultural indicators according to GRI contents was to recognize in the context of forest bioenergy production, the links between cultural sustainability and other sustainability dimensions and to illustrate the new themes that cultural sustainability integration would bring to CSR management of the business. In addition, information was acquired from the general themes of cultural sustainability which are currently lacking from the GRI guidelines. Findings – The results of the show that most of the cultural indicators in the expert interview material were associated with aspects of economic, environmental or social sustainability when classified according to the GRI guidelines. Despite this, it seems that a more profound integration of cultural sustainability evaluations in CSR management is required. The analysis of this study showed that the themes “Impacts on landscape,” “Timeline of impacts,” “Spiritual values,” “Persistence of traditions” and “Adaptability to cultural change” are not approached in the GRI guidelines at all. All of the identified themes approach issues, which have been found to be crucial in forest industries’ operations not only in a local, but also in a global context. Research limitations/implications – The analysis of this study was limited to cultural characteristics of forestry and forest industries especially in the case of forest bioenergy production in North Karelia, Eastern Finland. Due to this, the results cannot be generalized directly into other CSR management contexts of forest industries in different geographical areas. Despite this, the results of this study indicate that when aiming to enhance the acceptability of forest industries in energy production as well as in other branches of forest industries, new insights are needed on the integration of cultural aspects in CSR management. Originality/value – The pressures toward using local forest resources are increasing internationally. As a result of this, the managers and politicians responsible for making decisions on forest sector are less seldom familiar with local traditions and the ways of balancing different needs related to forests in various geographical contexts. In enhancing the environmental, social and economic sustainability of forest resource usage it is crucial to ensure that the decisions made do not conflict with cultural values of localities traditionally dependent on forests.

Design/methodology/approach – An online survey was conducted. Among the 978 respondents, a total of 548 respondents who used B&I foodservice equal to or more than five times a month on an average were included for analyses. Findings – The result revealed that consumers tended to perceive the concept of sustainability as “equivalent to (32 per cent) or beyond (28 per cent) being green or eco-friendly”. Consumers appeared to perceive the need for and the quality of sustainable B&I foodservice highly, but their awareness was comparatively low. Consumers’ awareness was significantly different across all demographic and food-related lifestyle variables. However, significant differences in the need and perceived quality were found only among food-related lifestyle variables. The result also indicated that 66 per cent of consumers were willing to pay a premium average of USD 0.72, 21 per cent of the reference meal price (USD 3.53) proposed in the survey. Consumers’ gender and eco-friendly dietary lifestyles were the significant determinants in predicting consumers’ willingness to pay a premium. Originality/value – With concerns over environmental crisis, sustainable development has been a mainstream agenda across the world. However, the issue of sustainable development appears to be relatively overlooked in the field of foodservice research. This study is meaningful, in that it calls attention to the importance and potential of realizing sustainable foodservice and provides a starting point in relevant researches. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business-and-Industry (B&I) foodservice; Corporate social responsibility; Institutional foodservice; Price premium; Sustainable development; Sustainable foodservice",,"Kim, S.; Foodservice and Marketing Lab., Department of Food and Nutrition, Seoul National UniversitySouth Korea",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09596119,,,,"English","Int.

On the one hand, North American scholars have primarily understood the link between business and politics through the lens of corporate political activity (CPA) looking at how firms influence government policy. On the other hand, European scholars have recently promoted an understanding of corporate social responsibility (CSR) emphasizing that firms often assume a political role because they increasingly provide public goods and become involved in multi-actor governance processes. This article contrasts both approaches and suggests that differences in the way the political role of corporations are understood can at least, in part, be explained by the distinct nature of European/North American management scholarship as well as by the political environment in both regions.

By showing that sustainable market offerings are feasible, products with sustainability labels, such as Fairtrade and organic products, implicitly question the legitimacy of mainstream brands in the market. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses an experiment, based on scenarios that portray the consumer in a shopping situation for their usual coffee brand when they encounter an organic Fairtrade coffee. The paper distinguishes a situation in which the sustainable and the mainstream products compete, from a situation in which the two brands collaborate. Findings – The results show that norm-challenging products deteriorate perceptions of mainstream products and the companies that produce them but improve the image of retailers that include these products in their assortment. If labelled products are sold under the heading of mainstream brands, they still spill over negatively to other products of that brand but positively to the brand company. Practical implications – The spillover effects of norm-challenging products to mainstream companies are an incentive for mainstream firms to enhance the sustainability of their activities.

By examining the comprehensiveness of the GRI performance in corporate non-financial reports classified as A+ the authors challenge the external assurance system imposed by GRI 3.1 A+ and discuss future directions for the application of GRI 4.0, particularly with regard to the standardized corporate reporting software language XBRL. Design/methodology/approach – The authors applied a three-step-research design based on four literature-derived hypothesis and examined all 177 GRI 3.1 A+ reports (2012-13) by coding along 41 variables plus the 84 performance indicators of GRI 3.1 to test accessibility, ability to download, achievability, and the possibility to compare them to older reports. Findings – The results indicate a lack of completeness of GRI’s 3.1 key performance indicators in A+ assured reports, that is made possible due to the reporting flexibility and voluntariness of the guideline.

We propose that the default consumer position is to accept a brand's narrative, and we find that consumers maintain belief in this narrative even when explicitly reminded that it is manufactured by firms with an underlying profit motive. Because belief seems to be the default position adopted by consumers, we investigate what factors act as disruptors to this default position, thereby reducing assessments of authenticity. Methodology - This research uses a series of studies to investigate when and why consumers view some brand stories as authentic and others less so. In addition, we examine the impact of changes to authenticity assessments on managerially important brand outcomes. Findings - Only when one or more authenticity disruptors are present do consumers begin to question the authenticity of the brand narrative. Disruption occurs when the focal brand is perceived to be nakedly copying a competitor, or when there is a gross mismatch between the brand narrative and reality. In the presence of one or both of these disruptors, consumers judge brands to be less authentic, report lower identification, lower assessments of brand quality and social responsibility, and are less likely to join the brand's community. Implications - Creating compelling brand stories is an important aspect of any marketing manager's job; after all, these narratives help drive sales. Care must be taken when crafting narratives however, since consumers use these as the basis of their authenticity assessments, and brands deemed inauthentic are penalized.

Also, the findings suggest that the presence of ethics and CSR stand-alone subjects in the accounting and auditing masters analyzed is partially explained by the size and the cultural influence exerted by the geographical location. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Accounting curriculum; accreditation; corporate social responsibility; ethics; ranking",,"Andrades Peña, F.J.; Department of Management, University of Cadiz, Avda.

Design/methodology/approach - Published CEO letters and the presence of global pulp and paper manufacturing companies in the social media in 2012 are analysed in this study using content analysis. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis is used to investigate the impact played by headquarter location, firm size and lagged profitability as a measure of slack resources on the quality of CSR disclosure. Findings - Company size and slack resources were found to increase the quality of traditional sustainability communication, whereas company size was the only significant factor explaining communication quality in social media usage. Environmental issues were the most common disclosure topic, accompanied by community issues. A curvilinear association was interestingly found between slack resources and communication quality. Research limitations/implications - The sample frame was selected from the 100 largest pulp and paper companies globally, and for better generalization, future research should aim at also analyzing data from small and medium enterprises and from other industries. Practical implications - Findings of the paper are useful for firm self-evaluation and benchmarking of disclosure activities by other businesses across the pulp and paper industry.

Design/methodology/approach - Actual adoption rates of 13 information content categories are computed using content analysis of annual reports for 62 listed companies. Each content category is seen as an innovation the company decides to adopt or not. Interviews with management in several companies illustrate the decision process of disclosure, and help predict adoption rates. Predicted and actual adoption rates are compared. Findings - Adoption rates vary considerably among the 13 types of content. The absolute level of adoption rates is affected by company size and environmental risk. However, those content categories that have either relatively high or low adoption rates are consistent among the subsamples, regardless of these corporate characteristics. This consistent variation in adoption rates seems to be predicted well by innovation adoption theory and its focus on the five attributes of the information itself: compatibility, trialability, complexity, observability and relative advantage. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical framework allows for different or changing internal and general contexts, and should be applicable to other settings, even though the particular predictions for adoption rates in this paper may not be applied as such. Originality/value - The level of analysis is changed from company level, which dominates previous research, to information content (individual content categories). Perceived attributes of the information content itself and innovation adoption theory are used for the first time to explain reason for the reporting practice, and are considered fruitful tools to predict consistent variations in adoption rates among different types of content.

Communicating that environmental policies and activities are motivated by concern for the environment could elicit positive reactions, but may also lead to accusations of corporate greenwashing - the idea that companies deliberately frame their activities as 'green' in order to look environmentally friendly. The results of three experiments demonstrate that people easily suspect greenwashing when an energy company invests in environmental measures. Importantly, suspicions of corporate greenwashing are reduced by acknowledging economic motives instead of communicating environmental motives for such investments. Suspicion of strategic organizational behavior mediates the effect of communicated motive on perceived corporate greenwashing. This indirect effect occurs primarily among people who are not by nature very skeptical about organizational communications in general.

Dixon School of Accounting, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States","Purpose: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure is receiving increased attention from the mainstream accounting research community. In general, this recently published research has failed to engage significantly with prior CSR-themed studies. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it examines whether more recent CSR reporting differs from that of the 1970s. Second, it investigates whether one of the major findings of prior CSR research - that disclosure appears to be largely a function of exposure to legitimacy factors - continues to hold in more recent reporting. Third, it examines whether, as argued within the more recent CSR-themed studies, disclosure is valued by market participants.Design/methodology/approach: Using Fortune 500 data from the late 1970s (from Ernst & Ernst, 1978) and a more recent sample (2010), the authors identify differences in CSR disclosure by computing adequate measures in terms of disclosure breadth and comparing them for any potential changes in the influence of legitimacy factors between 1977 and 2010. In the second stage of the analysis, the authors use a standard valuation model to compare the association between CSR and firm value between the two time periods.Findings: The authors first find that the breadth of CSR disclosure increased significantly, with respect to both environmental and social information provision. Second, the authors find that the relationship among legitimacy factors and CSR disclosure does not differ across the two time periods. However, the analysis focusing on environmental disclosure provides evidence that industry membership is less powerfully related to differences in reporting, but only for the weighted disclosure score. Finally, the results indicate that CSR disclosure, in apparent contrast to the arguments of the more recent mainstream investigations, is not positively valued by investors.Research limitations/implications: The authors explore changes in CSR disclosure only for industrial firms and as such the authors cannot generalize findings to companies in other industries. Similarly, the authors focus only on companies in the USA while different relationships may hold in other countries. Further, the disclosure metrics are limited by the availability of firm-specific information provided by Ernst & Ernst. Limitations aside, however, the findings appear to suggest that the failure of the new wave of CSR research in the mainstream accounting community to acknowledge and consider prior research into social and environmental accounting is potentially troublesome. Specifically, recent CSR disclosure research published in mainstream journals often lends credence to voluntary disclosure arguments that ignore previous contradictory findings and well-established alternative explanations for observed empirical relationships.Practical implications: This paper provides supporting evidence that the unquestioned acceptance by the new wave of CSR researchers that the disclosure is about informing investors as opposed to being a tool of legitimation and image enhancement makes it less likely that such disclosure will ever move meaningfully toward transparent accountability.Originality/value: The study suggests that CSR disclosure, while used more extensively today than three decades ago, may still largely be driven by concerns with corporate legitimacy, and still fails to provide information that is relevant for assessing firm value. As such, the failure of the mainstream accounting community to acknowledge this possibility can only hinder the ultimate development of better accountability for all of the impacts of business. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CSR disclosure; Disclosure changes; Ernst; Ernst; Legitimacy theory; Market valuation",,"Cho, C.H.; Department of Accounting and Management Control, ESSEC Business SchoolFrance",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09513574,,,,"English","Account.

The concept of CSR and the use of sport to achieve the objectives of CSR have become common buzzwords. Within CSR, most of the academic literature, or research, has focused on defining or framing CSR through sport particularly discussing the implementation or staging of CSR activities by both sporting and non-sporting organisations. However, not much has been done regarding the practicalities of designing CSR programmes by employing stakeholder involvement theory and conducting of a thorough needs analysis before programme deployment. Design/methodology/approach-This explorative study is based on participatory action research informed by international sport-for-development experiences. A qualitative approach was adopted in assessing the application of stakeholder involvement theory (Morsing and Schultz, 2006) in programme design and assessment of the target group’s needs. Findings-The old CSR approach was fragmented and lacked integration into local area needs. The new CSR approach ensures that community needs are reflected in CSR activities. The delivery of CSR by Euroleague Basketball professional clubs secures a licence to operate through joined-up approaches with mainstream partner agencies. These social partnerships instil a sense of community ownership of One Team Basketball projects.

Methodology/approach - A structured survey questionnaire is used to collect data from multiple stakeholders through social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn. The data is collected from employees, customers and investors of different companies in Pakistan. The data is analysed to examine the perceptions of different stakeholders towards effectiveness of social media for CSR communication. Findings - The results indicate that the majority of respondents think that social media is very important platform to communicate CSR activities. Overall, respondents believe that social media is a trustworthy tool to communicate CSR activities and engage stakeholders. Customers believe that communication of CSR activities through social media influence their buying behaviour positively. We found strong intentions among employees to work for socially responsible corporations who are successful in communicating their CSR initiatives to their employees through social media. Research limitations/implications - The study collected data from Pakistan only, a larger sample from different countries can provide more interesting results. The study didn't used sophisticated statistical tests; the future studies can develop a rigorous theoretical model explaining how use of social media as communication strategy can influence the behaviour of diverse stakeholders. Practical implications - Since social media is becoming an effective communication platform, corporations should pay more focus on using social media. The corporations should encourage stakeholders' views related to CSR communication on social media and carefully address their suspicions in order to engage them. Originality/value - There is sparse research in literature that examine the use of social media to engage organisational stakeholders. The current study provides a direction to future researchers to explore this area and explain the use of social media as CSR communication strategy in better way. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20430523,,,,"English","Dev.

This leaves unanswered the question how much we should rely on firms’ sustainability-oriented voluntary initiatives at a time when the global economy continues to be weak and firms face persistent threats of decline. In addressing this question, we first argue that the effect of a decline would be different for peripheral and core initiatives. Using data gathered from 478 small firms representing multiple manufacturing sectors in the United States through a survey, we empirically demonstrate that a decline in a firm’s financial performance is associated with a higher decline of peripheral initiatives than of core initiatives. We further found that a decline in peripheral initiatives was even greater when a firm operated in a relatively dynamic context. Contextual dynamism, however, did not affect decline in core initiatives. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.","community and environmental initiatives; core–periphery; corporate social responsibility (CSR); cost stickiness; environmental dynamism; organizational decline; recession; small firms; SMEs","core-periphery relations; cost analysis; firm size; global economy; manufacturing; performance assessment; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability; United States","Panwar, R.; Departments of Forest Resources Management ‖ Wood Science, The University of British Columbia, 2424 Main Mall, Canada",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",10860266,,,,"English","Organ.

Consequently, good insight is lacking into non-Western markets where consumers may respond differently. China is a case in point, despite the popularity of the CSR concept and high societal expectations of firms. The purpose of this paper is to examine how Chinese consumers perceive the underlying components of CSR found in Western countries; whether their CSR expectations differ for local Chinese compared to foreign firms; and whether results differ across regions within China. Design/methodology/approach – A country-wide study was done using a questionnaire to collect data in seven distinctive regional markets across China. Findings – Findings show that the originally Western CSR construct seems generalizable to China, but consumers across all regions perceive two rather than four components: one combining economic and legal responsibilities (labelled “required CSR”) and another combining ethical and philanthropic responsibilities (“expected CSR”). Consumers expect local Chinese firms to take more responsibility than foreign firms, particularly for required CSR. Research limitations/implications – This study focused on consumer perceptions, not on actual buying behaviour, which is a potential area for further research. Follow-up investigation to see whether the findings regarding the CSR concept also hold in other emerging and developing countries would be worthwhile. This also applies to an extension of the different expectations vis-à-vis foreign and local firms. Practical implications – The study gives more insight into notions of standardization and adaptation with regard to CSR, considering China compared to other countries and China’s different internal markets. This is relevant for international marketers confronted with (potential) investments and activities in China, inbound or outbound, or in need of a comparative global perspective. Social implications – While the findings show some context-specificity for CSR in and across China, they also confirm the relevance of the originally Western CSR components to an emerging-market setting. These insights may be helpful for those interested in furthering CSR across countries, and locally as well as globally. Originality/value – This study responds to calls for an improved understanding of the context-specificity of the originally Western CSR construct and of the extent to which it may be generalizable to non-Western settings such as China. The authors used a sample covering all regions of China and discovered two important dimensions. The results may be helpful to guide the debate on the plethora of CSR conceptualizations into a more focused direction, with clear relevance for the marketing field. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Consumers; Local-foreign firms; Social responsibility",,"Kolk, A.; University of Amsterdam Business SchoolNetherlands",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02651335,,,,"English","Int.

Our results confirm that the more advanced awareness and CSR responsiveness in the UK is a consequence of a predominance of coercive and normative forces on the organizational field.

The purpose of this paper is to consider methods applied for the sustainability of products according to Korean domestic fashion and textile companies and clothing types and to investigate the limitation of current sustainability methods of companies. Design/methodology/approach – The study used document analysis and case studies of 396 companies. The study looked into newspapers, monthly magazines, and publications of fashion companies and internet web sites of almost every possible type that have been issued to date and analyzed the previous studies as well. Findings – The companies’ strategies are of three groups, the uses of environmental friendly materials: 36.9 percent (natural fibers, recycled fibers and biodegradable fibers), apparel reuse: 4.5 percent (remodeling/alteration and transform/combination with more materials), and eco-marketing promotions: 58.6 percent.

This has led companies to set aside the classic economic view and to adopt the 'triple bottom line', reporting social, environmental, and financial information, in order to satisfy their stakeholders' needs.

Design/methodology/approach - CSR and banks' annual reports and websites were analysed using a comprehensive disclosure framework to evaluate the themes of ethical standards, extent of CSR reporting, environment, products, community, employees, supply chain management and benchmarking. Findings - Over the seven years, bank CSR disclosure improved in all four countries. Australian banks were found to have the best scores and Indian banks demonstrated maximum improvement.

Research limitations/implications - This study indicates that financial institutions have a commitment to CSR activities. The comparison between financial institutions in developed and developing economies suggests that the motivation for such activities is complex. A review of the studied banks suggests that strategic rather than economic drivers are an important influence.

Methodology/approach - Communications by BP, Shell, and their opponents in this virtual war are compared, especially in relation to the creative use of the internet, digital technologies, and social media. Through a case study approach, the chapter shows how communications often center on contested notions of CSR and claims by the oil giants about their environmental impact, which opponents dismiss as ""greenwashing."" The various techniques deployed by both sides in this wideranging ""PR war"" are explored and contrasted in detail. Findings - The findings for each case study reveal the diverse, complex, and changing nature of the relationship between the oil industry and its critics. The chapter concludes by arguing that if CSR is seen as ""greenwashing"" by the public, it is only likely to fuel widespread skepticism of the oil and gas sector and of corporate claims about the environment more generally. Research limitations/implications - The research offers a snapshot of online and social media campaigns and PR strategies and tactics within the oil and gas industry rather than empirically grounded set of findings that can be easily applied to other fields.

This research note argues that firms’ CP and firms’ corporate political activity (CPA) may share common strategic antecedents; forces in firms’ political environment may shape both CP and CPA. Using S&P 500 data in a longitudinal analysis (1997-2004), the authors find evidence suggesting that industry-level political uncertainty increases firm propensity for engaging in both CP and CPA, above and beyond the propensity to engage in either as a stand-alone strategy. The authors use this preliminary evidence to explore political marketplace contingencies for the relationship between CP and CPA. CSR literature indicates that CP can benefit firms by creating and enhancing their relational wealth and institutional legitimacy. Such benefits may also serve firm interactions with government policy makers—a dynamic largely ignored until recently. The authors’ findings may indicate that, due to its institutional signaling ability and impact on firms’ reputations, CP may allow firms to differentiate themselves or stand out from others when faced with political uncertainty, and that these outcomes should be considered when firms engage in CP. © 2012, © The Author(s) 2012.","corporate philanthropy; corporate political activity; nonmarket strategies",,"Hadani, M.; St. Mary’s College of California, School of Economics and Business Administration Moraga, PO Box 4230, United States",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a survey of what has been written on the topic of women and CSR in Turkey. The data obtained, and the methodology used, come from Web sites belonging to the top 50 of Turkey's 500 Big Industrial Organizations as determined by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO) and sustainability reports. The data obtained were assessed through content analysis; they were categorized by themes and sub-themes. Findings - In analyzing the research data, CSR activities involving women as external and internal stakeholders were classified as direct, indirect or both. Research limitations/implications - Because this study is qualitative in nature, the findings cannot be generalized. At the same time, as the enterprises in the state sector do not have CSR links, the results focus primarily on the private sector. Practical implications - The results indicate that there have been efforts in Turkey to consider women as stakeholders in CSR activities; however, these efforts are limited. Social implications - Women are a part of community and they are stakeholders to businesses. Businesses could support women with CSR activities. Originality/value - A study such as this one of the role of women as stakeholders in Turkish enterprises may contribute to understanding the role of women in Turkey today. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Awareness; CSR; Projects; Woman",,"Oruc, I.; Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, Anadolu UniversityTurkey",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Design/methodology/approach: Resource Dependency Theory was used to guide the study. The study adopted explanatory research design. Questionnaires were used to collect data from sample of 216 respondents through stratified and simple random sampling technique. The study used inferential statistics to test hypotheses. Findings: Study findings indicated that joint marketing alliances, procurement-supplier alliances, joint manufacturing alliances and technology development alliances have significant and positive effect on firm performance. Based on the findings, creating a joint marketing, procurement-supplier, joint manufacturing and technology development alliances mostly enhance firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The study considered only one county out of 47, although this county hosts the capital city, where most of the firms considered are located. It therefore is representative of all counties and firms considered in this study. It also considered top management staff and thus may have an effect since the lower cadre staff were not considered. However, most of the required information was expected from top management since these are the ones who make decisions, and hence most affected by strategic alliances. Practical implications: This study has practical implication on firm performance because it has established that strategic alliance improves on overall firm performance. This manifests itself in terms of improve productivity, production efficiency and profitability. It also helps in the availability of products to the end users. Social implications: Through improved productivity, efficiency and profitability, this translates to improved terms of payment of staff and hence improved quality of lives of their families and communities within which they live. It also enables the firms to participate more in corporate social responsibility projects which in turn improves the standard of living of the communities around them. Originality/value: The study has provided an empirical insight on the importance of strategic alliance on firm performance. This is the first study done in the Kenyan context concerning strategic alliances formed by firms to improve on their performance especially on retail firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Joint manufacturing alliances; Joint marketing alliances; Procurement-supplier alliances; Technology development alliances","Commerce; Costs; Efficiency; Human resource management; Manufacture; Marketing; Productivity; Profitability; Sales; Social aspects; Surveys; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Design/methodology/approach; Inferential statistics; Joint marketing; Resource dependency theories; Simple random sampling; Supplier alliance; Technology development; Technology transfer","Muange, R.; Department of Management Sciences, Moi UniversityKenya; email: rosemuange@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17542731,,,,"English","TQM J.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947080702

Methodology/approach - The first survey carried out by Data Media ltd. was a quantitative research: an in-depth interview with the managers in charge with the CSR activity in 100 Romanian companies. The theoretical scope of the paper was to enable us to see how spread is the phenomenon of corporate social responsibility and how deep it is embedded in the practices and policies of Romanian companies. Findings - I found out that the majority of CSR managers of the considered companies were treating CSR as a sort of marketing and PR (as a matter of fact, almost 50% of them were members of the Public Relations Romanian Association (ARRP). Research limitations/implications - The research should be repeated in order to measure the evolution of the phenomena, and to check out if their trend was heading to the strategic stage in Zadek's scale. Practical implications - The practical changes as a result of this research should be in the perception of the public interest as a landmark for social responsibility, so as in the future the CSR not to be practiced as philanthropy or marketing. Social implications - The impact of this research on society is expected to be in changing the attitude toward CSR in Romania, in making it popular, in order to form a culture of social responsibility, and to contribute to Romania's sustainable development.

Methodology/approach - In order to explore this, we have analysed the CSR stories of companies published on the largest online repository from Romania, that is, the website www.responsabilitatesociala.ro. We explore two research questions: Could a repository site facilitate that more and more companies report their CSR activities? and Will a company that presented one case at some point in time present more cases in the next reporting period? For this purpose we have used as method the content analysis having as counting unit each article published and each company which, at some point, published something. Our analysis covered the articles published within 2006-2012 and thus we have used 1121 articles/case studies. Findings - In terms of findings, we conclude that such online repository leads to an important increase in the number of companies having their CSR activities published, although such increase has not been steady. In our view such reporting started a trend. Some companies, after being published in a certain year may have not reported the following year, but nonetheless, new companies decided to publish about their CSR activities each year. In the case of the second question, we could not determine a particular pattern. The number of companies which published, at least in 6 out of the 7 years we have analysed, has been quite low - 12, and there have been big discrepancies between years and between articles per company. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of our chapter is that we could not correlate the articles published with other variables, such as: reporting on Facebook and on the official webpage or the extent to which CSR managers from companies think that such repositories have exerted any type of good pressure on them to publish and report their activities. Practical implications - This approach is important for CSR managers and other stakeholders - such repositories can be both a source of inspiration and a good practice model. One can 'show, view and shop' CSR activities in one stop online and take the example further. We believe that this is something specific for all countries, where CSR entered the business as a public relations (PR) concept and then evolved. Originality/value - The value of our chapter consists in exploring such simple and on-hand online repositories and finding issues of interest for further research. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20430523,,,,"English","Dev.

Past research has hinted at relationships between these two areas - suggesting that ""lean is green"" (e.g. Florida, 1996). The lean mantra of waste reduction and ""doing more with less"" is immediately apparent as delivering environmental benefits and has formed the basis of past research (e.g. Hughes, 2012). Almost all research linking lean operations or lean supply chains to sustainability issues have focused exclusively on environmental impact. The purpose of this paper is to explore the broader sustainability benefits of lean operations.Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a longitudinal multi-year (up to four years observation), multi-case analysis (n=5).Findings: The paper reports that lean operations meet a wide range of sustainability outcomes beyond environmental benefits (including supply monitoring, transparency, workforce treatment, and community engagement). The paper specifies the internal and external policies, procedures, tools, and strategies for implementation of lean and sustainable operations management (OM). This is encapsulated in the development of a stage-based theoretical model of lean-sustainability. Further, it is proposed that lean implementation and sustainability performance are in fact interlinked.Originality/value: Past research on the role of lean operations in improving sustainably has focused almost exclusively on environmental benefits accruing from toolkit/workplace level waste reduction. This paper demonstrates that lean provides more than a toolkit (a philosophy and strategic direction) and that this meets a wide range of sustainable outcomes. This finding makes major contributions to conceptualising how lean operations influence sustainability outcomes. The paper develops the first integrative stage-based model of lean and sustainable OM. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case study; Green; Lean; Operations management; Sustainability",,"Piercy, N.; School of Management, Swansea UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",01443577,,,,"English","Int.

Less is known about an organization's corporate philanthropic disaster response (CPDR) directed towards their employees. We argue, based on conservation of resources (Hobfoll, 1989, Am. Psychol., 44, 513) and compassion organizing (Dutton et al., 2006, Admin. Sci. Quart., 51, 59) literatures, that employees perceive employers who provide aid to them following a natural disaster as supportive. This aid from CPDR provides support to employees and helps to restore the loss of valued resources. Accordingly, we predict that satisfaction with CPDR reduces employee psychological and physiological strain via its positive effects on perceived organizational support. We find support for our predictions using a sample of 695 Hurricane Katrina survivors. Finally, we discussed theoretical contributions and implications of this research. Practitioner points: Organizations are encouraged to fulfil their social responsibilities. Our research shows that organizations should be socially responsible not only to the general public, but also to their own employees. Responding compassionately by providing aid to an organization's own employees is an important element in carrying out their social responsibilities. In the aftermath of a severe natural disaster, employees may need to rely on their organizations to provide timely assistance. Such assistance could help them mitigate their strain, both psychologically and physiologically, aroused from the disaster they experienced. Organizations' compassion organizing in the form of philanthropic disaster response to their employees may be beneficial to the organization. First, it shows the organization's intention to fulfil their social responsibility and to be a good and ethical citizen. Second, by providing assistance to their employees to deal with the challenge of restoring normal lives, organizations can help employees to continue working in a productive and effective way. © 2014 The British Psychological Society.","Compassion organizing; Emotional exhaustion; Natural disaster; Perceived organizational support; Satisfaction with corporate philanthropic disaster response; Somatic complaints; Strain",,"Ren, R.; Guanghua School of Management, Peking UniversityChina",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd.",09631798,,,,"English","J.

We first built a theoretical framework based on the Motivation, Opportunity, and Ability (MOA) theory, which is a novel perspective for an energy-related study. To enhance this theoretical framework, we explicitly considered the effects of energy performance measurement on energy efficiency outcomes and their determinants in the MOA framework. We tested this novel framework using data from an industry survey conducted by the Energy Studies Institute, National University of Singapore. Using a partial least squares method, we found that the desire to cut operating costs and firms' know-how to implement energy efficiency both had a positive, statistically significant impact on energy efficiency outcomes. Know-how itself is driven by firms' know-what, which reflects their awareness and fundamental understanding of energy efficiency. Interestingly, the ability to monitor energy efficiency outcomes moderated the impact of cost-driven motivation. By contrast, firms' corporate social responsibility, regulatory compliance, and opportunity to implement energy efficiency were found to have no significant effect on energy efficiency outcomes in the context of the study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As a contribution to the previous literature, the moderating role of the type of company (savings banks vs. commercial banks) in the conceptual model is explored. Design/methodology/approach – A structural equation model is tested with information collected from 648 customers of savings banks and 476 customers of commercial banks. Findings – The findings demonstrate that CSR perceptions positively impact customer identification with the banking company, emotions, satisfaction, recommendation and repurchase behaviours in both samples. However, CSR is perceived differently by customers depending on the type of banking company that implements it. Thus, its effects on customers’ affective and behavioural responses are different. Practical implications – Practitioners should not try to promote the best CSR approach for a standardised organisation, regardless of its special industry characteristics. They should be aware of the differences customers perceive in companies to adapt their CSR initiatives to the expectations of their targets. Originality/value – The contributions of the paper are two-fold. On the one hand, the banking industry has been scarcely explored by previous scholars.

This study focuses on understanding firms' instrumental motivations for engaging in socially responsible activities. We suggest that the instrumental motivations underlying firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement are associated with their market, learning, and risk-related behaviors; thus, we identify market orientation, learning orientation, and risk-taking attitudes as three constructs that influence firms' CSR engagement. This research was conducted in the Norwegian firewood sector, in which CSR expectations are high and in which we expect CSR engagement to be encouraged by both instrumental and normative motivations. The firms in this study are micro-firms with fewer than 10 employees and represent an important but highly neglected segment of firms in CSR research. Data obtained from 230 firms were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Our results indicate that market orientation, learning orientation, and risk-taking attitudes affect social responsibility toward different stakeholder groups in different ways.

In contrast to this, new Web 2.0 social media is increasingly being used by activists and hactivists to challenge corporate communication CSR messages and does so by highlighting instances and examples of corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) (Jones et al., 2009; Tench et al., 2012). Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports on research data from the European Communication Monitor, 2010, 2011 and 2012 (www.communicationmonitor.eu/) and draws on work already published in this area (Tench et al., 2009; Verhoeven et al., 2012; Zerfass et al., 2010, 2011) to illustrate the unruly, unregulated Web 2.0 social media communication landscape in Europe. A range of literature is drawn on to provide the theoretical context for an exploration of issues that surround social media. Findings - In late modernity (Giddens, 1990), communication comes in many guises. Social media is one guise and it has re-shaped as well as transformed the nature of communications and the relationship between organisations and their stakeholders. Originality/value - Communicating CSR in the Wild West of social media requires diplomatic and political nous, as well as awareness and knowledge of the dangers and pitfalls of CSI. The data reported on in this paper well illustrate the above points and set out scenarios for future development of corporate communication of CSR through and with social media. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited, ISSN 1747-1117.","Communication; CSR; Irresponsibility; Social media",,"Jones, B.; Leeds Business School, Leeds Beckett UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Since the 1990s, an increase can be seen in corporate social responsibility actions, as well as increasingly strong activities by civil society organizations. Tweenty years ago, companies and civil society organizations stood wide apart from each other, with often conflicting agendas and resistance to mutual collaboration. This reality has changed significantly. Besides the phenomenon of cross-sector partnerships, we can also observe the expansion of a particular organization type, i.e., the social business, which combines two objectives that were previously seen as incompatible: financial sustainability and the generation of social value. This article aims to discuss the factors that influence the results of a social business operating in three countries: Botswana, Brazil and Jordan.

China currently has business ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) concerns primarily because its economy is in evolution. As the Chinese economy is in transition from the late 1970s from a command-Communist economy to a more hybrid system Beijing model (a system based on a capitalist market controlled through bureaucracy), much has to be understood if one wants to participate in its vast economic potential. Design/methodology/approach-The study is based on the building of a model that depicts the evolution of business ethics in China as a base for further research. Findings-With the rapid development of the Chinese economy, opportunities are opening up to Chinese entrepreneurs and connected officials. This has led to money worship and, in some cases, thorough unethical behavior. The uncertain and ever-changing rules of the game generate opportunity for business ethics and CSR problems. This wealth creates temptation and incentives to cut corners to get rich fast. Much research has tried to explain business ethics in China through the understanding of Guanxi (Chinese social network of reciprocal business relations common in Confucian cultures), but in my view, the evolutionary aspect of it is missing to explain the present and future situation. Whereas considerable research has dealt with the growth of Chinese industries in recent years, the key relationship between changes in its economy and shifts in Chinese business ethics has been neglected. This paper presents the evolution of Chinese business ethics and CSR policy. Originality/value-The paper illustrates the evolution of Chinese business ethics and how one has to adapt if one wants to succeed in its ever evolving and maturing market. A model is presented that can assist in future research in the area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business ethics; China; CSR; Governance; Guanxi; Social capital",,"Berger, R.; The College of Law and BusinessIsrael",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17544408,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach – The research approach employed for this purpose is a case study using evidence from a series of in-depth interviews conducted during the period 2002-2010. Interview data are supplemented by examining other sources of information including annual reports, stand-alone social reports and relevant newspaper articles during the study period. Findings – It appears that the stand-alone CSR reporting process was initiated to give the subsidiary a formal space in which to legitimise its activities in Bangladesh where both tobacco control regulation and a strong anti-tobacco movement were gaining momentum. At the start of the process in 2002 corporate interviewees were very receptive of this initiative and strongly believed that it would not be a one off exercise. However, in the face of subsequent significant national policy shifts concerning tobacco control, irreconcilable stakeholder demands and increasing criticism of the CSR activities of the organisation at home and abroad the process was brought to an abrupt end in 2009. Research limitations/implications – The paper has a number of implications for policy makers concerning the future prospects for stand-alone social/sustainability reporting as a means of enhancing organisational transparency and accountability. In addition the paper discusses a number of theoretical implications for the development of legitimacy theory. Originality/value – Using the lens of legitimacy the paper theorises the circumstances leading to the initiation and subsequent cessation of CSR reporting in the organisation concerned. As far as the authors know this is the first study which theorises and provides significant fieldwork-based empirical evidence regarding the discontinuation of stand-alone social reporting by a multinational company operating in a developing country. Thus, it extends previous desk-based attempts at using legitimacy theory to explain a decrease (or discontinuity) in CSR disclosures by de Villiers and van Staden (2006) and Tilling and Tilt (2010). © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bangladesh; Case study; CSR; Legitimacy; Social reporting; Tobacco",,"Belal, A.; Aston Business School, Aston UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09513574,,,,"English","Account.

The justification for this idea is provided by as many as five theoretical approaches, while the management of corporate transparency, information quantity and information quality is shown to be crucial to the success of CSR reporting.

In the light of this debate, the study analyzes the corporate social responsibility (CSR) approaches of this sample of corporate-owned foundations using the tri-dimensional CSR research model of Arthaud-Day (2005) to articulate the perspective, content and strategic orientations of the companies. Design/methodology/approach – The study selects three different corporate foundations based on internationalization scale and field of activities. A content analysis methodology is applied to the data collected from the official web sites of 24 corporate foundations. Findings – The analysis results show a general compatibility between the subsidiaries and the main branches of the corporate foundations, at least on the conceptual level. However, the practices of CSR activities, targeted stakeholders or content domains differ at the operational level. Nevertheless, local governance is still not totally independent, especially in terms of received funds. Therefore, this study concludes that the internationalization strategies of these corporate foundations are still at a formative stage of transnationalization. Research limitations/implications – The study explores the three selected international companies and their corporate foundations. Future studies may extend the number of selected industries and companies. Together with increased coverage, future survey studies may help explain the global or local orientations of corporate foundations’ CSR in different domains. Practical implications – Corporate foundations may extend their transnational strategies to further stages by differentiating between those units that should be managed on a global scale and those that should be managed by local authorities. They may balance the amount of investment in different regions while adopting collaborative governance models to respond to regions where grant applications are not an easy tool for stakeholders to use. Originality/value – Given the relatively paucity of CSR studies with an international focus, this study contributes to the standardization or localization debate in the international business literature. The study’s originality lies in its attempt to operationalize the theoretical research model and through its use of corporate foundations as the unit of analysis. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate foundations; International marketing; Social responsibility; Strategic orientation",,"Altuntas, C.; Department of Transportation Services, Yasar UniversityTurkey",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02651335,,,,"English","Int.

This study examined the mediation effect of job attachment on the relationship between employee perception on corporate social responsibility CSR activities and organisational commitment. Data were obtained through survey questionnaires from a sample of 143 firms operating in Malaysia. The results indicated significant relationships between perception of CSR and job attachment, and between job attachment and organisational commitments. However, this study found no mediation effect of job attachment on the relationships between perception of CSR activities and organisational commitment. This indicates that CSR activities can directly affect both job attachment and relate to individual feelings toward the job and organisational commitment, which relate to feelings towards the organization. These results suggest that CSR activities make a powerful contribution to intangible organizational benefits.

BM (The Stock Exchange of Malaysia) has made CSR, including ED in annual reports mandatory since 2007. This study compares environmental reporting (ER) before and after the 2007 mandatory reporting requirement to determine if this command and control mechanism has had any effect on the quality of ED. Design/methodology/approach - The quality of ED was measured using a disclosure quality index adapted from various prior studies. The index consists of a total of 46 disclosure items grouped into 9 categories. Content analysis was utilized to extract data from the annual reports of 164 PLCs in ESI. Findings - Overall, the quality of ED improved in 2009 from that of 2005. More importantly, companies disclosed more quantitative environmental information in 2009 than in 2005. However, the average quality of ED was still low in 2009 compared to the overall potential score. Results provide some support for legitimacy as well as institutional theories. Research limitations/implications - The sample of the study consisted of listed companies in ESI only; the results cannot be generalized to other companies in non-environmentally sensitive sectors. Practical implications - Prior studies that used data before the mandatory CSR requirement by BM found ED in annual reports mainly declarative in nature, generally low on quality and with little quantifiable data. The results of the present study provide evidence of the positive impact of mandatory environmental reporting on ED quality. Originality/value - The use of a multi-theoretical perspective may offer a more meaningful explanation of ER behavior in Malaysia. The results of the study would provide the impetus for regulatory agencies in developing countries to perhaps consider legislating ER. The findings provide some evidence to support the influence of legitimacy and institutional factors behind improved ED of Malaysian PLCs. This outcome exhibits a positive influence on the government efforts in promoting sustainability. Finally, the study contributes to present a more up-to-date account of environmental commitment undertaken by Malaysian corporations through their environmental reporting, after the CSR mandatory listing requirement took effect in 2007. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental disclosure; Environmental reporting quality; Institutional theory; Legitimacy theory",,"Abdullah, N.; Faculty of Business Management and Accounting, University Sultan Zainal AbidinMalaysia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

To answer that need, this chapter explores how pharmaceutical companies communicate their corporate social responsibility activities. Methodology/approach - This chapter explores how Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi (all in the top 10 of US foundations by total giving) use their websites to articulate their CSR strategies. In order to achieve this goal, an exploratory research that combines semantic analysis of the way the mission, vision and objectives are integrated in their strategy was conducted. To do so the researchers saved the text about each company's mission and vision from their main websites (the .com) and saved all the data associated to CSR communication and reporting included on each company website in a word document. One hundred and ninety-one pages of text were thus collected in August 2013 (67 pages of text for GlaxoSmithKline, 38 pages for Sanofi and 87 pages for Pfizer). Wordle and VOSViewer were used to gain insight into the emerging themes from the textual data collected and therefore compare the similarities and differences between the three companies. Findings - Our findings show a strong emphasis on business-related activities for Sanofi and GSK reflected through the vocabulary used. Additionally, the two companies also portray corporate social responsibility as a tool for image and reputation building and for achieving wider yet profit-driven organisational goals. CSR messages therefore are intended to create and consolidate corporate identity. Moreover, whilst their mission focuses on patients, health, care, and access to medicine, the values are also oriented towards profit making and economic criteria. Pfizer on the other hand, although sharing some of the mission and values with the other two companies, presents itself as a more inclusive organisation with a collaborative environment and research-focused culture. Research limitations/implications - While limited in scope and sample, this chapter raises many valuable questions for future research about the pharmaceutical sector's understanding and definition of CSR and their differences and similarities in their online discourse and vocabulary in comparison with other profit-driven industries. Moreover, it raises questions about the style and nature of corporate communications and whether this should be consistent with that associated with CSR as well as whether it imposes the creation of a company-ego. Practical implications and originality/value - This chapter promotes an alternative exploratory method of online discourses through computeraided techniques. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20430523,,,,"English","Dev.

This paper explores the extent to which climate governance influences the role and practice of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in development. We draw on case study evidence from copper mining concessions in Northwestern Zambia in order to examine how CSR activities are adopting norms of climatised development. Our results show that the extractive industries are increasingly initiating CSR activities to align with local livelihoods, and therefore play a key role in climate compatible development (CCD). In addition, they act as context changers through for example, in-migration, which increases pressure on local forest resources. However, these roles go unacknowledged by both industry and government as CSR activities are disconnected from broader CCD priorities. We discuss the positive and negative implications of drawing the extractive industries into the CCD arena. We link to critiques of politicized CSR and consider practical implications, both for the sector and the achievement of climate development goals. We conclude that CSR activities should be seen as a local manifestation of multilevel engagement between the extractive industries and broader development sectors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Community engagement; Extractive industry; Forestry; Mitigation; Zambia","Forestry; Adaptation; Community engagement; Extractive industry; Mitigation; Zambia; Climate change","Leventon, J.; Sustainability Research Institute, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, United Kingdom",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Our results show that to overcome the LOF, at least in Chinese market, foreign retailers should emphasize value-for-money retail mix attributes such as increasing product quality and running effective promotional campaigns.

The first is to provide a reconceptualisation of social value creation as social constraint alleviation. The second is to respond to the call put forward by Giuliani and Macchi (2014) to produce synergies between bodies of literature exploring the development impact of businesses. The paper focuses on ideas from the global value chain/global production networks (GVC/GPN), business and human rights, corporate social responsibility (CSR), international business (IB) and (social) entrepreneurship literatures. Design/methodology/approach – The paper offers a reconceptualisation of social value creation by building on the synergies, complementarities and limitations of existing concepts identified through the literature review. Findings – The reconceptualisation of social value creation put forward in this paper contributes to the literature in the following way. It offers a useful and clear definition of the term “social” (Devinney, 2009), and it attends to the limitations of the constraint concept as put forward by Ted London and his collaborators (London, 2011). Furthermore, it sketches out the basic ideas of a two-system approach to allow for the differentiation between symptom treatment and root cause alleviation. Finally, it offers a refinement of Wettstein’s (2012) proposed capability-based remedial action concept. The paper furthermore proposes that there are three distinct ways in which businesses generally respond to social constraints. Originality/value – The paper illustrates how the redefined concept of social value creation can connect different bodies of literature and help make sense of existing empirical results, without engaging in definitional debates. © Sinkovics, Sinkovics, Hoque and Czaban.","Business model; Business-society interface; Constraints; Economic upgrading; Global value chain; Globalisation; International business; Rising powers; Social upgrading; Social value; Social value creation; Upgrading",,"Sinkovics, N.; Centre for Comparative and International Business Research (CIBER), Manchester Business School, The University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17422043,,,,"English","Crit.

High-status banks were found to be particularly likely to engage in illegal recovery practices. This was especially true when a high-status bank had experienced a decline in its financial asset quality or had fallen behind the financial asset quality of its peers.

After reviewing what we already know about self-leadership, this paper goes on to investigate ways that research and practice might move to a higher level. The concept of higher-level self-leadership (supported by the metaphor of a self-leadership high road) is addressed in terms of the degree to which self-influence processes are characterized by authenticity, responsibility, and increasing capacity. Authenticity encompasses the significance of addressing higher-level standards (e.g., considering the why and what of self-influence beyond the how). Responsibility is viewed in a way that is consistent with commonly understood elements of corporate social responsibility. Capacity centers on the expansion of self-leadership potential, which can bolster results reflecting authentic and responsible ends. Specific facets of higher-level self-leadership that are discussed include the pursuit of virtue, collaboration as a self-leadership strategy, and self-influence of emotions.

Initially, particularly from the 1980s when Japanese firms came to prominence, these practices tended to be identified as 'best practice'. However, at least in part due to socio-economic changes, this tendency has become less prominent since the 'bubble economy' burst. Instead, three broader developments are observed: the examination of the continuity and change in the traditional Japanese model, a more complex approach that involves multiple themes of research, and leveraging new contexts to examine Japanese firms, including the long-term recession, the rise of the East Asian economy, and the increasing importance of corporate social responsibility. © 2014 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,"Endo, T.; Cardiff University, Colum Drive, United Kingdom",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",14608545,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 270 annual reports from 54 companies, both public and private, across a range of sectors and covering a five-year period (2001-2005) was analysed using content analysis to ascertain patterns and trends in corporate social reporting by Libyan companies. Findings - Libyan companies generally disclose some information related to social responsibility but at a low level compared with developed countries and only in certain areas. This situation changed little over the five-year period under scrutiny. Research limitations/implications - During the five-year period examined, corporate social responsibility remained largely unresponsive to significant changes in the political scene that occurred over a much longer period of time. This suggests that further research is needed to illuminate the role and influence of societal culture and to understand the impact of organisational subculture on disclosure and responsibility practices.

We study the evolution of a set of influential environmental and social risk management guidelines for project finance - the Equator Principles (EP) - and the simultaneous structuration of a field around these guidelines focused on the issue of socially accountable project finance. The case is theoretically framed using Hoffman's (1999) concept of an issue-based field and associated conceptualisations of the role of internal and external (social) movements in the structuration of these fields. The structuration of the issue-based field studied is shown to encompass a dynamic, contested process involving extensive interactions between a non-governmental organization (NGO) movement and a commercial bank movement. We unveil how the conflicting, collective rationales and actions of both movements fuelled the structuration process and facilitated an evolution in the social accountability of commercial banks. While prior work sees little potential for civil society actors to engage with and move corporate social responsibility and reporting in a more challenging direction, we reveal how the NGO movement evoked a progression in social responsibility and reporting in a sector that had previously shown little inclination to address its wider social accountability. Drawing on our case analysis, we theorize how issue-based fields cohere and crystallise, particularly how they build an institutional infrastructure based upon the infrastructure of the mature field which they straddle and which the relevant issue impacts upon. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,"O'Dwyer, B.; University of Amsterdam Business School, Plantage Muidergracht 12, Netherlands",,"Elsevier Ltd",03613682,,,,"English","Account.

Practical implications - The results obtained in the current paper show that investors invest less money in ethical pension plans than in traditional and solidarity pension plans; this could be due to the lack of information for their part. To solve this, management companies could increase the transparency about their corporate social responsibility (CSR) investments to encourage investors to invest in ethical products so these lead to raising CSR standards in companies, and therefore, sustainable development. Social implications - The Spanish socially responsible investment retail market is still at an early phase of development, and regulators should promote it in order to encourage firms to adopt business activities that take into account societal concerns. Originality/value - This paper provides new evidence in a field little analysed. This paper contributes to the existing literature by focusing on examining the behaviour of pension funds investors whose investment time horizon is in the long-term while previous literature focus on analysing behaviour of mutual fund investors whose investment time horizon is in the short/medium term what could cause different investors’ behaviour. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Business strategy; Consumer behaviour; Financial institutions; Make or buy decisions; Pensions",,"Martí-Ballester, C.P.; Department of Business, Universitat Autònoma de BarcelonaSpain",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",00251747,,,,"English","Manage.

Design/methodology/approach-An analysis is made of the appropriate literature and primary research conducted via interviews with 11 senior professionals from three globally renowned companies, one global financial organisation and two corporate advisory firms. Findings-The findings from this research provide evidence that CRE can be used to add value to the core business, both in the physical and behavioural environment. By aligning aims and objectives with the business, continually conducting portfolio analytics, encompassing size, cost, space, retention and productivity, value can be added, maximising shareholder worth. Research limitations/implications-The main conclusions drawn from this study are that CRE can add value to the business. The role of corporate real estate asset managers (CREAMs) needs to change from the physical environment to the behavioural environment, working to increase productivity, which can have greatest impact on shareholder value. Originality/value-This paper provides evidence to suggest that CRE ’s role is not only to manage property but should be broadened to add value to the organisation by aligning CRE strategy with the corporate strategy. Closer interactions with human resource and information technology are required to enhance productivity, via relationship management, perhaps outsourcing to provide best in industry expertise.CREAMscan shape the future of office space, by demanding carbon neutral properties.

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative approach is used in which a new strategy in a European multinational company (MNC) is studied at the subsidiary level in Brazil and Argentina. The authors discuss why the strategic processes are so different within the same MNC. During 2009-2011, 50 interviews were conducted with respondents in Latin America and at headquarters. Findings – The results point to the importance of including relationships with both business and non-business actors to understand the subsidiary strategy processes. The authors suggest that such processes can be explained by interdependent relationships in a wider network context characterised by commitment and trust, leading to increased legitimacy among the actors involved. Practical implications – Managers need to invest in relationships not only with business counterparts but also with non-business actors, as they are interdependent and vital for the strategy development. Originality/value – Relationships between firms and actors such as governments and civil society are still under-researched, although they are essential, especially in emerging economies. The paper puts focus on network relationships in strategy research and contributes to the development of business network theory by extending the network to also include relationships with such non-business actors and relate it to strategy processes.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses mixed methods and a cross-sectional field study design to explore the ethical investment practices of 300 of the largest charities by investments in the UK and Norway. Practices are theorized using the dual lens of institutional theory and social origins theory. Findings – The paper provides evidence on why charities established the practice of ethical investment. The results show that large charities were more likely to have an ethical policy; that charities with moderate public sector funding weremore likely to have an ethical policy. In line with institutional theory some Norwegian charities with public sector funding mimic the policy of the Government Pension Fund, and the ethical investment policy of Norwegian charities was more influenced by donors. Institutional entrepreneurs (charity founders) had a more prominent influence in UK charities. Research limitations/implications – The paper highlights that more research is needed on sovereign wealth funds, their investment practices and how they affect charities. Practical implications – The findings of this paper highlight the potential role that the ethical investment practices of sovereign can play a soft regulatory function in changing the behaviour of other investors. Social implications – To the extent that ethical investment practices are construed as having a positive social impact, then this study shows how a government sovereign wealth fund can influence the spread of ethical investment practices. Originality/value – This paper, which sits at the nexus of the charity and corporate social responsibility (CSR) literatures, contributes by responding to calls for more research on charity practices in different countries and CSR practices in different countries. This comparison also contributes to the development of institutional theory by shedding light on the institutional influence of a sovereign wealth fund and its impact on others.

The authors examined documentation of listed firms from 2006 and 2009. These years immediately precede and follow Italian legislative decree n. 32/2007, which introduced (albeit on a voluntary basis) disclosure of environment-related company information. Design/methodology/approach - The authors’ approach utilizes multivariate regression analysis. The disclosure index of the years 2006 and 2009 represents the dependent variable. Independent variables include firm size, business industry, public shareholders, legislation and environmental performance. Findings - The results show positive effects on environmental disclosure related to legislative decree n. 32, the presence of government shareholdings in firms’ ownership structure, business industry and firm size. The interrelation between firm size and environmental performance shows that large companies give more information only if they produce more environmental pollution, to legitimize themselves to stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - Despite the authors’ contributions concerning environmental information described in the Introduction, they must express two limitations of their analysis. First, the sample analyzed is quite small (only 44 firms). Second, carbon dioxide emissions was chosen as an indicator of atmospheric pollution, yet emissions information has not been provided by Italian firms (even those that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange), despite being accepted internationally as a measure of environmental performance in business. In addition, in Italy, there is no database ranking firms on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Practical implications - There are many reasons behind the weak or even negative roles of managers regarding social and environmental disclosure. These reasons include a dearth of resources, the profit imperative, lack of legal requirements, insufficient knowledge or awareness, poor performance and fear of bad publicity. What seems to be a real obstacle is the lack of knowledge about non-financial disclosure - in particular, how to gauge, produce and release information when it comes to a firm’s interaction with environment and society, and this void causes low levels of disclosure and even the absence of such action. Some of the reasons for non-disclosure might be attributed to a lack of awareness and knowledge among corporate managers regarding CSR reporting, in general, and disclosure on eco-justice issues, in particular. Originality/value - The first contribution of this work is to realize, for the first time, a specific analysis on Italian firms’ environmental disclosures. Moreover, the study extends this analysis to all entities’ informative documents. This paper also allows an examination of effects of new legislation that encourages environmental information in a corporation’s financial annual report. Finally, this is the first paper to conduct quantitative analysis on firms in the Italian financial market concerning environmental disclosure, as well as regression analysis to identify determinants of firms’ disclosure. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Disclosure; Environment",,"Fontana, S.; University of Rome SaoienzaItaly",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13683047,,,,"English","Measuring Bus.

Drawing from ethnographic work, I utilize examples from the tea industry in Tanzania to characterize the pragmatic nature of how standards govern at a distance in local contexts. These examples are the: 1) use of Fairtrade funds to fulfill community obligations; 2) participation in value chain actors' bids for external technical assistance; and 3) participation in donor-funded projects unrelated to standards schemes, yet enable compliance with certification requirements. The analysis reveals that the nature of these programs is a combination of historically entrenched systems and neoliberal approaches to development. By conceptualizing these standards as agencements, rather than instruments of private regulation, we are able to better capture governmentality in the Foucauldean sense - as the mobilization of standards to provide public goods is a mode of governing that necessarily involves far more actors than the State alone. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agencement; Certification; Corporate social responsibility; Governmentality; Standards; Tanzania","Chains; Standards; Agencement; Certification; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Governmentality; Tanzania; Regulatory compliance","Loconto, A.; Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, UR 1326 Sciences en Société (INRA-SenS), Institut Francilien Recherche Innovation et Société (IFRIS), Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée 5, France",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Findings – The authors find 11 forms of activities that sport organisations and athletes have implemented to provide social support in post-disaster situations. These forms are classified based on type of post-disaster social support: eight forms are categorised as tangible support, while the other three are categorised as emotional support. Research limitations/implications – The findings are based on the analysis of the news media that predominantly reported North American cases, and the current list of disaster relief activities may exclude some activities ignored by these specific data sources. Using the forms of disaster relief activities identified in this study as an initial framework, future studies should engage in the focused analysis of disaster response among sport organisations and athletes. Practical implications – The comprehensive list of the disaster relief activities identified by this study should aid the decision-making of sport organisations and athletes in facing disasters and enable them to better prepare for their disaster response. Originality/value – This study reveals the extensiveness and uniqueness of disaster relief activities currently implemented by sport organisations and athletes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Athletes; Corporate social responsibility; Disasters; Relief efforts; Sport organisations; Sporting events",,"Inoue, Y.; School of Kinesiology, University of MinnesotaUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09653562,,,,"English","Disaster Prev.

This remarkable case of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is analyzed from a risk-governance perspective. It is grounded on a case study of the CSR practice of the Dutch casino monopoly, in particular the problem gambling mitigation and self-exclusion program of this corporation. The intentions and operations of this ‘responsible gambling’ practice constitute new business values and working norms. At the same time empirical evaluations of the self-exclusion program reveal that despite all the efforts put in the risk-management strategies, a significant part of the problem cannot be addressed at all.

Because of the informational asymmetry between consumer and producer, and despite the recent EC Regulation No. 1169/2011 on the provision of information to consumers on food, which became fully operational after 2014 and which provides for greater labelling transparency, consumers make choices based on the quality perception of a product without reaching the desired level of food safety and without understanding the benefits of environmentally and socially friendly products. Firms that wish to adopt corporate social responsibility initiatives, in a competitive scenario, need to understand how consumers make choices. To this end, this study investigates the intrinsic and extrinsic attributes that affect food choice like environmental certification, water footprint and carbon footprint as well as ethical aspects; information on the interviewee's ability to read the label and any problem understanding it were also requested. A questionnaire was conducted on a sample of 238 Italian consumers using face to face interviews. The data generated in this way were submitted to a descriptive analysis and cluster analysis.

Using an equalweighting scheme for content analysis of Form 10-Ks from 136 firms, we completed a comparative analysis on the extensiveness of climate change disclosures for the pre-and post-periods surrounding the SEC pronouncement. We observed a statistically significant increase in the disclosure of information related to climate change in 2010 compared to 2008, but no similar effect when comparing 2010-2009 reporting. There was a significant disclosure increase in 2009 compared to 2008. We conclude-based on a hypothesized anticipation of the SEC actually mandating climate change information in filings-that firms augmented their disclosures during 2009 in advance of the official guidance being published. This is a rather significant outcome given the historical lack of environmental disclosure subsequent to previous SEC mandates.

Design/methodology/approach – Anchoring this study in institutional theory, the authors explore how formal and informal institutions affect the legitimacy of MNCs’ CSR marketing practices in the host country of Pakistan. The authors conducted interviews with top managers from 15 local MNCs undertaking CSR programs in various sectors, such as automotive, banking, consumer products, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications. Findings – The authors find that MNCs show commitment to CSR programs despite underdeveloped and very weak formal institutions, and that lots of these initiatives such as education, health, environmental protection, and civil society/religious organizations are oriented toward norms-based social CSR marketing, i.e. charitable and philanthropic work, civil society-led social media and religious groups also force MNCs to spend more on CSR marketing initiatives. MNCs follow headquarters’ global CSR marketing strategies and adapt their CSR programs to the host country’s norms, focussing on their product brand value related CSR marketing. However, the MNCs have not taken an integrated approach to CSR marketing, considering the overall institutional environment of the host country. Research limitations/implications – On the basis of very weak regulatory constraints on CSR marketing activities, MNCs have the propensity to develop normatively acceptable CSR marketing under very weak formal institutional pressures. The findings suggest the need for developing an integrative approach to the CSR strategies of MNCs, comprehensively incorporating regulatory, economic, and socio-cultural as well as various stakeholders’ perspectives. Originality/value – The authors take the institution-based approach to MNCs’ CSR marketing in the context of the developing economy, which extends the extant MNC and international marketing literature. Particularly, MNCs’ CSR marketing legitimacy depends highly on the adaptation to local norms, leading to the importance of the normative pillar of institutionalization in developing economies. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Developing economy; Institutions; Legitimacy; Multinational corporations; Norms",,"Lew, Y.K.; Manchester Business School, The University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02651335,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach Based on content analysis of corporate risk reporting, the paper develops measures of environmental risk to proxy for a firms exposure to public pressure in regard to environmental concerns that should be positively associated with the level of corporate environmental disclosures according to socio-political theories. Multiple regressions are used to test the predictions of socio-political theories for US Standards and Poors 500 constituents from polluting sectors. Findings The level of environmental disclosures is found to be positively associated with a firms environmental risk while unrelated to its environmental performance. The findings suggest that firms tend to provide higher levels of environmental disclosures in response to greater exposure to public pressure as depicted by broad environmental indicators. The results are robust to alternative measures of environmental disclosures, environmental risk and environmental performance, alternative specifications of the economic model and additional sensitivity checks. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to US firms in polluting sectors. The risk-based approach proposed may not be appropriate to cover sectors where corporate risk reporting is less likely to address environmental risk, but it could potentially be adopted in other countries with advanced risk reporting regulation or practice. Practical implications Findings are important to understand a firms incentives to disclose environmental information. Cross-sectional differences found in environmental disclosures, risk and performance, highlight the importance of considering industry affiliation when analyzing environmental data.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how regional headquarters (RHQs) of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in Africa pursue CSR and whether their initiatives are aligned with their own global CSR agendas or tailored to local idiosyncrasies. Design/methodology/approach – Following a secondary data analysis of MNEs’ CSR and sustainability reports and their homepages, in-depth interviews with their CSR managers in African RHQs are conducted. Findings – The paper provides insights into motivations of RHQs to pursue specific CSR initiatives. MNEs need to make considerable adaptations to their global CSR agendas in order to develop initiatives that fit the local setting. The authors further identify key institutions in developing countries and discuss the potential of collaborations with MNEs in their CSR initiatives. Research limitations/implications – Future research should assess the impact of environmental differences (e.g. developing nations compared to industrialized nations) and firm characteristics on CSR autonomy (both at RHQs and at the subsidiary level). Furthermore, the perspectives of the various stakeholders (such as local governments or NGOs) should be examined to establish a holistic understanding of CSR in developing countries. Practical implications – MNEs gain a better understanding of peculiarities encountered in developing countries and are provided with recommendations on how to develop their CSR policies. Social implications – The paper directs awareness to CSR in the African context, thereby providing a platform for understanding some of this continent’s most important challenges.

This issue, which can result in slavery, should concern businesses. Almost 30 million slaves exist globally today.

However, companies can exercise social responsibility by using their influence over suppliers and business partners to prohibit human trafficking. This article examines the extent to which companies are involved in combating human trafficking, and helps companies identify where they are at risk for involvement with human trafficking. Moreover, steps are suggested to prevent human trafficking from occurring within company operations and supply chains. © 2014 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","Code of ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Human rights; Human trafficking; Slavery; Supply chain",,"Smith, K.T.; Arthur J.

Social enterprises are a fast-growing part of a larger third economic sector. However, compared to other industries, there are relatively few social enterprises operating in construction and little is known about the challenges they face in doing so. In-depth interviews at 12 UK social enterprises reveal that many of the challenges faced by social enterprises in the construction industry are similar to those faced by social enterprises operating in other industries. These include: building trust, managing hybridity; securing finance; measuring social impact; and achieving scale. However, in addressing the lack of sector-specific insights in social enterprise research, challenges unique to construction are also identified. These include: procurement practices which favour industry incumbents; costly tender bureaucracy; established supply chain relationships; lack of experience of working with social enterprises; disingenuous corporate social responsibility practices; and fear that social enterprises will reduce competitiveness. Recommendations are made to resolve these challenges, enabling the construction sector to create an ecosystem where social enterprises can thrive.

In 2006, Bursa Malaysia Berhad (BMB) launched its CSR Framework (effective in 2007) which is supposed to guide the Malaysian PLCs' CSR disclosures. It is believed that this CSR framework may influence CSR disclosures to be more systematic, yet there is no evidence whether this framework influences the extent and quality of CSR disclosures. Thus, this study examines this area of research. The study also tests the influence of award on CSR disclosures. Design/methodology/approach - CSR disclosure checklist was developed to analyse the extent and quality of CSR information disclosures in the year 2008 annual reports of the Malaysian PLCs. Findings - Malaysian PLCs disclose more CSR information related to community and environment than workplace and marketplace CSR themes. On the other hand, the quality of disclosure practices was minimal when it is compared to the extent of disclosure practices. Finally, the study also found that the award's variable has a significant positive relationship with both the extent and quality of CSR disclosure practices of the Malaysian PLCs. Research limitations/implications - The recently developed BMB's CSR framework seems to have impact on the level and systematic CSR reporting practices of Malaysian PLCs. However, the quality of CSR disclosures is considered minimal. Practical implications - The results of the study bring some practical implications to the regulators, particularly Bursa Malaysia. First, it is good to observe that most companies have practiced specific disclosure in a separate statement with regard to CSR. However, the format of presentation and the extent of disclosure vary among the firms. Second, further guidelines need to be developed to provide a clearer framework of disclosure for CSR information. At the moment, Bursa Malaysia only listed down general principles of CSR themes. In addition, the regulators should also look into the evolving issues in CSR, such as the issue of climate change reporting. For example, the Climate Disclosure Standards Board has issued a voluntary Climate Change Reporting Framework. Originality/value - This study examined both the traditional (i.e. firm size and profitability) and non-traditional (i.e. award) factors influencing management's decision to disclose CSR information in the annual reports of the Malaysian PLCs. Furthermore, the study reported how Malaysian PLCs comply with the recently implemented CSR framework issued by BMB. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Awards; CSR disclosures; CSR themes; Malaysia",,"Rashid, H.M.A.; International Islamic University MalaysiaMalaysia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Design/methodology/approach – Year-ending 2007 and 2010 annual report disclosures of 31 IDX-listed companies are analysed. The widely acknowledged Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines are used as the disclosure index checklist. Findings – The results reveal that the overall labour disclosure level increases from 21.84 per cent in 2007 to 30.52 per cent in 2010. The levels of four of the five specific labour disclosures also increase with employment being the exception. The results further show that the Indonesian Government does not influence the increase in the levels of the overall labour disclosure or the four categories showing increased disclosure but, surprisingly, does significantly affect the decrease in the level of the employment category. Research limitations/implications – It is implied that the government is at best ambiguous given that, on one side, the government regulates all corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and reporting but appears to coercively pressure companies to hide employment-specific issues. Practical implications – It is implied that Indonesian companies need to have “strong and influential” independent commissioners on the boards to counter any possible pressures from the government resulting in lower disclosure levels.

The past two decades have witnessed considerable changes in the CSR field with the introduction of new voluntary CSR instruments. Organizations adopting such tools may perceive some of the existing and emerging CSR instruments as redundant or complementary. Design/methodology/approach – The relationships between the CSR instruments analysed are treated through the lenses of institutional entrepreneurship and coopetition theories. The analysis presented is based on secondary data such as literature reviews, publications and online resources and databases from the UNGC, GRI and ISO as well as personal communications with representatives of ISO, GRI and UNGC. Findings – The paper shows that from the users’ perspective, CSR instruments should not be treated as separate alternatives, but rather as complementary to each other. At the same time, organizations that set up CSR instruments have to strengthen their existing collaboration as a network, in order to contribute more effectively to sustainable development. Research limitations/implications – The use of secondary data to discuss some of the ISO 26000 diffusion trends might provide an incomplete picture but still offer interesting insights. Practical implications – This study allows to better understand the linkages, overlaps and differences between three CSR instruments: UNGC, GRI and ISO 26000. At first sight, some of these instruments may appear as redundant but our analysis point out that they complement each other. They have different goals and are useful in different parts of one organization’s CSR infrastructure. These instruments help organizations to implement different CSR tools at different stages of integrating sustainability issues into their strategies and operations. Originality/value – CSR instruments have mainly been examined separately by scholars. In contrast, this study analyses ISO 26000, UNGC and GRI as a collaborative mechanism and predicts the fit of ISO 26000 within these well-established CSR instruments. The main contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the relationships between organizations that are developing and promoting prominent CSR instruments. In addition, we apply organizational theories to our analysis as a novel perspective. This study contributes to institutional entrepreneurship theory by showing how organizations playing the role of institutional entrepreneurs may encourage the early adoption of a new CSR instrument. It also contributes to the coopetition theory by applying this approach outside the traditional business setting. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Coopetition; CSR; GRI; Institutional entrepreneurship; ISO 26000; UNGC",,"Rovira, M.R.; Institute of Environmental Science and Technology, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)Spain",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20408021,,,,"English","Sustainability Account.

Results indicate that integrity is a predictor of transformational leadership behavior and that transformational leaders' behaviors are linked to CSR practices. It was also found that leaders rated with higher integrity are engaged in CSR because they exhibit more transformational leadership behaviors. These findings add to the extant literature by demonstrating that integrity is important as transformational leaders engage more actively on 'responsible' behaviors.

A large number of general approaches and methods for the development of sustainable products has been proposed and used in the literature, but how they can be integrated to improve the design process in the Green Aircraft Completion (GAC) sector is an open research question. This paper was developed from this question and it reviews and analyses several design methods and eco-design approaches from the literature in order to propose a novel integrative conceptual framework for the GAC. This framework is then applied in a large North American company so that it could be tested and improved. This experience allowed the researchers to verify whether the development of new textiles in the studied company comply with the sustainable frameworks and good practices proposed by the literature.

Using a path model and data from 100 experienced, nonprofessional investors, we examine whether the quality of a corporation’s voluntary CSR disclosure increases its perceived organizational legitimacy and if increases in perceived legitimacy help insulate that organization from negative investor reactions following an exogenous shock. The results provide strong support for the model and show that when CSR disclosures are higher quality, investors perceive organizational legitimacy to be higher, inferring that organizations should emphasize quantifiable, consistent, and comparable reporting. Further, the results indicate that higher levels of perceived organizational legitimacy are associated with greater levels of organizational resilience to an intra-industry exogenous shock. © 2015, American Accounting Association.

However, educating and informing consumers alone is unlikely to change deeply entrenched unsustainable consumption behaviour. A multi-faceted approach is required - enforcing sustainable development initiatives through legislation, promoting corporate social responsibility programs on the part of business, and (most importantly), supporting communities that engage in sustainable consumption. This study examines the proposition that individuals who identify with their community (i.e. the residential suburb or a locality where identity is understood geographically) are more likely to engage in sustainable consumption. Specifically, it examines how consumption value (i.e. the perceived value of living in a particular residential suburb) contributes to place identity and to environmental attitudes and sustainable consumption behaviour. Structural equation modelling is used to verify the conceptual model using data from a telephone survey of 561 residents from two inner city suburbs in Auckland, New Zealand. The results support the proposition that environmental attitude and sustainable consumption behaviour is enhanced by consumption values through place identity. Residents who enjoy living in their community, value a clean and healthy environment and believe their suburbs are unique tend to develop a stronger identity with their residential suburb, and are more positive towards sustainable consumption. The results have important implications for social marketers, property marketers and city councils who strive to encourage sustainable consumption among its citizens. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Consumption values; Environmental attitude; Place identity; Structural equation modelling; Sustainable consumption",,"Lee, C.K.C.; Department of Marketing, School of Business, Monash University MalaysiaMalaysia",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",14706423,,,,"English","Int.

It aims to shape, order and evaluate the field for the first time. Visual forms are important to accounting because of their power and their ubiquity in an increasingly visual society. Visual forms constitute representation (incremental information) or construction (impression management) or both. The paper defines the visual broadly to include pictures, photographs, film, architecture, diagrams, advertisements and web pages that appear in a wide variety of documentary and geographical locations. It encompasses papers that examine a wide range of issues (from impression management, visual rhetoric, professional identity, gender and diversity to corporate social responsibility, intellectual capital, myth and religion).

The paper also aims to provide a roadmap for integrating sustainable business practices using information systems (IS) approach of continuous improvement lifecycle. Current business practices try to achieve economic, social and ecological goals independently as silos due to the individual operational challenges posed by each of these TBL principles. Design/methodology/approach - The research design mainly adopts a quantitative research methodology with data collected by means of a survey questionnaire that included both descriptive and exploratory flavour. The empirical study examines the relationships of TBL elements as perceived by 85 different Australian-based large, medium as well as small business organisations. The data collected were analysed by performing factor analysis on 21 items, resulting in three latent factors that were aligned to TBL outcomes and the correlations among them were analysed to assess their inter-relationships. Findings - The results of the study report weak and positive relationships existing between the TBL elements, with insights gained through the study leading towards useful implications that are well-supported by the qualitative feedback. The empirical study has also resulted in providing practical recommendations and an implementation framework consisting of a four-step roadmap with the participation of quality circles within an IS approach. Practical implications - The study focuses on inter-relationships and integration of TBL elements in Australian businesses. This could be extended to other businesses in different countries. The proposed roadmap with a continuous improvement cycle of system implementation steps facilitates any organisation to adopt an incremental integration of the social responsibility and environment protection practices within its core business operations for achieving corporate sustainability. Originality/value - While most of the TBL studies conducted worldwide focus on predominantly assessing large organisations towards responsible and sustainable business practices, this paper considers large, medium and small businesses. The research methodology adopted in this study as well as the proposed IS approach with quality circles add value to a growing body of literature with a recent increasing focus on integrated approaches for corporate sustainability.","Corporate sustainability; Information system integration; Quality circles; Triple bottom line",,"Venkatraman, S.; Department of Higher Education - Business (IT), Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFEAustralia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

We study the emergence and development of Social Return on Investment (SROI): an accounting methodology intended to permit managers both to incorporate stakeholders' voices and to communicate the social value created by the firm for those stakeholders. We find that the ability of SROI to account for specific stakeholders, thus categorizing them as salient for the firm, is shaped by managers' epistemic beliefs and by the organization's material conditions. Our findings contribute to stakeholder theory by showing that the prioritization of stakeholders is not solely a managerial decision, but instead is dependent on the construction of an appropriate accounting and reporting system, as shaped by managers' epistemic beliefs and by the organization's material conditions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.","Social accounting; Social return on investment; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder prioritization; Stakeholder salience; Value creation",,"Hall, M.; London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton St, United Kingdom",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00222380,,,,"English","J.

We differentiate between strengths and concerns in stakeholder management to demonstrate the differential effects of the two aspects of stakeholder management. Previous research on stakeholder theory often focuses on the importance of stakeholder relations, trying to build a business case of relational capital that results from strong stakeholder management. Such a relational approach, however, overlooks the process of managing stakeholders, a process that allows firms with strengths in stakeholder management to develop an important capability of managing tensions. In this study, we argue that this capability, an inherent part of stakeholder management, can be critical when firms face increased complexity during the process of international diversification. We therefore propose that strengths in stakeholder management are positively related to international diversification, while concerns in stakeholder management are negatively related to international diversification. Using panel data for 169 US multinational firms over a 10-year period, we find support that strengths in stakeholder management facilitate international diversification.

Whereas the pilot study showed us the feasibility of the model, the main study results indicated how the stakeholder relationships are managed in a group of sample IT organizations when compared to the ideal criteria given by the proposed model. The model may prove to be a managerial guide for the managers at all levels for their attempts to integrate stakeholder interests into the management processes. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","integrated management approach; integration of stakeholders into management processes; Stakeholder theory",,"Demirel, A.G.A.; Department of Business Administration, Yeditepe University, Bol. 34755 Kaylsdagl, Turkey",,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

Design/methodology/approach – Data collection occurred in 26 states and the Federal District of Brazil. There was validation of 171 questionnaires answered at the strategic and tactical levels in the context of cooperatives in 13 sectors of Brazil’s economy. Structural equation modeling was used as an application to verify the data with the use of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings – The results made it possible to verify the relationship between SMC and the social and environmental performance. The coefficient found for the relationship between SMC and economicfinancial performance also had a positive effect. Practical implications – The research results provide evidence that SMC is directly related to the economic-financial and socialenvironmental performance of cooperative organizations. SMC may also contribute to the analytical process of organizations from the statistical dimension and an applied empirical structure. Originality/value – The model reached support in both relationships with significant values, demonstrating that the dimensions and scales used to measure it were satisfactory, validating the proposed model. This finding demonstrates that these organizations have the skills to meet the requirements of and manage stakeholders, even if one person plays different roles, i.e. the cooperative member, which is basically the owner, supplier, consumer and customer. © FECAP.","Cooperatives; Performance; Stakeholder management capability",,,,"FUNDE SCOLA COMERCIO ALVARES PENTE ADO-FECAP",18064892,,,,"English","Rev.

Monitoring spatial plans increases knowledge of whether they achieved their goals in guaranteeing sustainable development on a territorial level. Indicators are suited for this task and could play an important role in determining the applicability or effectiveness of plans. The contribution of indicator sets for effective strategic sustainability monitoring needs to be supported by an analysis of consistency and meaning at each stage of indicator development, from design to implementation. Indicator selection is usually done by experts and/or through participatory approaches and often little is known about the robustness of the selection stage, its utility, accuracy, validity, feasibility and redundancy. The main goal of this research is to identify, through a participatory approach and data reduction techniques, a set of sustainability indicators for strategic monitoring of regional spatial plans. Decision makers and planning practitioners from regional and local authorities, as well as academics, were asked to assess through a scoring procedure the importance of a base set of sustainability indicators to monitor the effects of a spatial plan. Principal Components Analysis, followed by sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulation were used in the data reduction phase. This approach was tested on a set of outcomes/effects indicators developed for the Algarve's regional spatial plan (southern Portugal). It was possible to highlight the importance of involving different groups of stakeholders and to identify relevant indicator selection criteria, as well as a final set of indicators that are more representative of different stakeholders' opinions and more able to translate, in an integrated way, overall changes in sustainability performance. Factors that can influence the results of the approach are discussed, such as stakeholder representativeness and data availability. Recommendations regarding the use of the approach and its results are also presented, for example concerning the use of information conveyed by indicators in an aggregated way, in the form of an index. The approach could be useful to guide the collection of regional sustainability data, contributing to the reporting and assessment of spatial plans, tailored to each particular territorial reality and stakeholders' perceptions, values, needs and concerns. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is done in a context where prior studies in the literature do not relate these concepts to each other or place the concepts within a meaningful context, nor integrate them into a single framework. The framework demonstrates an organisational journey towards achieving legitimacy in environmental endeavours. Environmental legitimacy is conditional upon the public evaluation of corporate environmental performance and environmental reporting (environmental accountability), which in turn, requires organisations to invest in environmental management and accounting systems and stakeholder engagement (environmental proactivity). The paper identifies company, stakeholder and other characteristics that influence the constructs in the framework and also propose a research agenda based on this framework. Environmental performance constitutes the central concept in the framework, acknowledging that improved environmental performance promotes the ultimate goal of sustainability. The framework suggests that the judicious management of environmental performance and reporting, the two components of environmental accountability, results in environmental legitimacy. Furthermore, environmental accountability can be enhanced by environmental proactivity, a concept comprising environmental management and environmental accounting, as well as stakeholder engagement.

Greed represents extreme self-interest whereas altruism reflects concern for others. We argue that managerial greed leads to a focus on short-term decisions and short-term firm performance. Alternatively, managerial altruism normally produces a focus on longer term decisions and long-term firm performance. Managerial greed is also more likely to produce wrongdoing, whereas managerial altruism produces greater corporate citizenship behaviors. Managerial greed is likely to lead to turnover for non-performance–related reasons whereas managerial altruism is more likely to produce managerial turnover for performance reasons. Overall, we conclude that measured self-interest keeps managers focused on the firm’s goals and measured altruism helps the firm to build and maintain strong human and social capital. The extremes of either greed or altruism likely will harm firm performance. Thus, balance between managerial self-interest and managerial altruism leads to the greatest success. © 2015, © The Authors 2015.","agency; CEO altruism; CEO greed; self-interest",,"Hitt, M.A.; Management Department, Mays Business School, Texas A&M UniversityUnited States",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",15480518,,,,"English","J.

In a search for diversification, tourism and film may be targeted by these regions. Challenges of regional planning, however, include lack of local expertise, decentralized decision making, and diverse stakeholder groups. Specifically for film tourism this includes anticipating visitation numbers and assessing potential negative impacts. Broken Hill, located in Outback Australia, was used to investigate the complementary integration of film into regional development and tourism strategies. A stakeholder engagement process that adopted a transactive approach was implemented. The main findings of this process highlighted the need to develop the strong film presence into a visitor-friendly product, coordinating the film product with other destination strengths, establishing an expert and sector-diverse governance team, and developing a consistent brand with film as a component. Implications for other regional areas include considering how a film presence can be harnessed to develop film tourism experience opportunities, utilizing film tourism and production expertise to develop a coordinated and sustainable product, and to promote film experiences reflective of their place in the destination hierarchy. Finally, for film tourism, is the need to utilize representations of the range of destination experiences in film in destination marketing. © 2015 Cognizant Comm.

It avoids predictive and positivist evaluation approaches and commences with a rejection of natural, human, and social capital being measurable in monetary terms, due to the high level of uncertainty relating to what constitutes a sustainable future. A qualitativebased methodology, grounded in the five capitals model of Forum for the Future, is explored for the evaluation of sustainability. On the basis of some main critical aspects, which are common to various socio-technological systems, this approach identifies criteria for a generalised governance assessment methodology for evaluating the possibility of systems for more sustainable futures. Underpinning these criteria is a multidisciplinary approach, a ‘Governance Assessment Matrix Exercise’ (GAME), which provides a toolkit for setting general criteria for sustainability for each of the dimensions of the five capitals model and choosing between alternative futures through a participatory process of stakeholder engagement. The central theme of the article is that the choice between alternative futures should be participatory in nature and the success of this process can be aided by an acceptance of a commonly derived set of sustainability criteria supported by a governance structure. The approach can be described as a process of social learning through which participants can understand and explore the implications of different actions and policies and select potentially more sustainable choices. © W.

It explores the role of regulation and procurement consortia in sustainable procurement. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a case study of the UK social housing sector and uses an online survey (n = 116) of UK Housing Associations. Factor analysis identifies three parsimonious dimensions of sustainable procurement. Attitudinal data are analysed to explore the field-level adoption of sustainable procurement and the role of consortia. Findings - The results delineate sustainable procurement activities into three factors; direction setting, supplier-centric assurance and local socially oriented supply. High yet sup-optimal levels of sustainable procurement activity are revealed. Prevailing attitudes identify positive commitments to sustainable procurement at individual, organisational and sector levels. The value of network collaboration is identified. Tenants as critical stakeholders do not prioritise sustainable procurement creating challenge for inclusivity. Regulators are seen to a have low level of sustainable procurement knowledge and procurement consortia a high perceived knowledge. Research limitations/implications - Results provide insight into the effect of sustainable procurement policy, the role of regulators and network structures and consortia, raising issues around legitimacy, coopetition, stakeholder engagement, performance measurement, and functional/sectoral maturity.

In order to infer the current level of environmental performance and the progress being made it is imperative that universities measure and report their campus greening efforts. This paper shows that sustainability reporting can be a simple task and is of significant value for directing sustainable campus operations. To do this, Environmentally Extended Input Output Analysis was used to derive the carbon footprint for the University of Leeds. Being driven by financial data which is readily available to universities the assessment is easy to conduct and maintain through time. Environmentally Extended Input Output Analysis provides complete coverage of the campus system and thus accounts for the majority of emissions sources. Accordingly, it enables comparisons of environmental performance to be made between institutions. The reliability of comparisons falters when organisational boundaries vary between carbon footprints, and thus, in the interest of methodological consistency, a framework should be established that defines universal organisational boundaries which universities must adhere to. Interviews with university procurement staff showed that carbon footprints can provide a screening assessment which identifies emissions hotspots in supply chains. Such as assessment is currently lacking and provides evidence of win win situations where emissions and costs can be reduced simultaneously. Although carbon footprinting considers only the environmental dimension of the triple bottom line, it is recommended that universities intensify its application. For the institutions themselves the results will be of significant practical value for directing initiatives such as sustainable procurement and for enhancing stakeholder engagement with the sustainability agenda, whilst an increased application will help build much needed momentum for sustainability reporting overall. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Campus greening; Carbon footprinting; Environmentally extended input output analysis; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable procurement","Carbon footprint; Decision making; Education; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Campus greening; Carbon footprinting; Input output analysis; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable procurement; Sustainable development","Townsend, J.; School of Earth and Environment, University of LeedsUnited Kingdom",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

This often calls for the creation, use and exploitation of new knowledge. Therefore, knowledge resources must be properly managed to enable wellinformed decisions. There is, however, little empirical research on the key drivers for managing sustainability-related knowledge in the UK industrial sectors - which is the core aspect of this paper. For this study, four industry sectors: energy and utilities, transportation, construction and not-for-profit organisations were considered, based on the environmental, social and economic impact on UK society. A semi-structured interview method was used to collect industry perception, which was then analysed at both aggregate and sector levels using content analysis for inference and conclusion. The data analysis revealed four key drivers that have fuelled the need for managing sustainabilityrelated knowledge. They are: to improve access to knowledge associated with sustainability initiatives, to identify knowledge assets associated with sustainability initiatives, to improve the flow of knowledge associated with sustainability initiatives and to capture key knowledge associated with sustainability initiatives. The paper concludes that identifying and understanding the key drivers for managing knowledge within the context of sustainability is a complex process.

Drawing from resource dependency theory (RDT) and related theories of social networks and the resource-based view of the firm, the authors develop a series of hypotheses that draw from this conceptual foundation to predict a range of factors that influence firms to collaborate with NGOs. These factors include the level of commitment of the firm to CSR, the strategic fit between the firm’s and the NGO’s resources, the level of trust the firm has in NGOs, the frequency of contact with NGOs, prior level and perception of experience with NGOs, and the level of pressure exerted by NGOs. The authors report on results of a survey of the Top 500 firms in the Netherlands on their interactions with NGOs, finding general support for our hypotheses, and suggest that understanding the motives for firm–NGO interactions can teach us more about firms’ corporate social activities and the way such activities are shaped in the dynamic interplay between firms and their stakeholders. Our findings are relevant for future research on cross-sectoral interactions, for corporations considering future relationships with NGO cohorts, and for broader questions about the role of stakeholders and the role of business in society. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","corporate responsibility; cross-sectoral interactions; nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); stakeholders",,"Doh, J.; Villanova University, Center for Global Leadership, Bartley Hall Rm 2079, 800 Lancaster Ave, United States",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 248 Italian public companies publishing a code of ethics as of 2011 is used to test the hypotheses through Tobit regression models. Findings – A positive or negative impact is derived from the implementation of a high-quality code of ethics. Codes of ethics are strongly influenced by the ownership structure of the company given the critical role played by primary shareholders with larger stakes in influencing the quality of a code. Moreover, the lower the number of independent directors, the higher the firm’s propensity to invest in code of ethics’ quality. Similar results were found in relation to board size and CEO age, where smaller boards and younger CEOs are more inclined to implement higher-quality codes of ethics.

The authors examine this question in the unique context of Major League Baseball’s (MLB) relationship with the “buscones” (agents) representing prospects from the Dominican Republic. Design/methodology/approach-Using game theory, the authors model how MLB teams create rules to curb unethical behavior within the supply chain. The principal relationship the authors will model is that of the franchises and the prospects. This relationship has as its core an investment decision by the individual franchises: Should they incur costs to ameliorate the context in which the prospects find themselves, or not? The costs of investment, whether it is in academies, general education, a revision of recruiting policies or something else, must be weighed against the negative externalities that are likely to result if the exploitation of the DR recruits becomes common knowledge to other stakeholders, particularly the public. Findings-The model shows that when investments are roughly evenly distributed, the teams successfully vote to outlaw unethical behaviors and thus collectively avoid the negative externalities. However, when investments are asymmetric, the teams invested in the current system vote against a ban to maintain a competitive edge, even though the system imposes costs on all of those involved. Originality/value-This paper serves as the initial paper that examines international sourcing, social responsibility and baseball. As international sport clubs/franchises continue to source athletic talent from around the globe, the issues discussed in the paper are both original and pertinent. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate responsibility; Dominican Republic; Social responsibility; Sourcing; Sports",,"Bouchet, A.; Collins College of Business, University of TulsaUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

Design/methodology/approach-The paper consists of a literature review and two surveys. The literature review concentrates on exploring investors’ and tenants’ CR and sustainability drivers. Empirical evidence was gathered via two specific surveys. The first survey targeted investors, and the second survey targeted tenants to determine the focus areas of sustainability. Findings-The findings of this study indicate that the vicious circle of blame can be turned into one of cooperation with respect to sustainable buildings if the mutual drivers for improving sustainability are linked with investor–tenant collaboration. Based on the survey, the tenants claim that productivity, corporate culture and image are the primary drivers for sustainable buildings, whereas the investors claim that corporate culture and image, tenant demand and marketability are the primary drivers. Both parties mentioned the same sustainability drivers: corporate culture and image and lower operating costs. However, it was found that investors are not communicating their CR actions to public or promoting image and productivity benefits of green buildings to potential tenants. Research limitations/implications-The limitation of this study is the sampling of Nordic countries, as there are indications of different situation in other markets such as the USA. Originality/value-Improving sustainability in the real estate industry is linked to investor– tenant collaboration. In addition to common drivers, both investors and tenants have their own list of benefits and drivers for sustainable buildings. These drivers are linked to each other. Making progress with respect to sustainability in the built environment depends on people in the industry being aware of the importance of and possibilities offered by sustainable buildings, as well as being able and willing to act on this knowledge.

The ontology offers a semantic model for representing and reasoning about the stakeholders of transportation projects, the benefits generated by transportation projects, and the analysis of the social equity of transportation projects based on stakeholder input and expected benefits. The theoretical foundation of the proposed equity analysis is grounded in the area of social welfare theory. The ontology was verified and validated using automated consistency checking, automated redundancy checking, expert evaluation, and real-life case study evaluation. The proposed ontology-based system may support infrastructure system decision-making by assessing the social (group) welfare based on the economic, social, and environmental benefits of transportation project alternatives and taking stakeholder preferences into account, and may lead to better identification of the alternative(s) that offer the highest social welfare. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Benefit analysis; Information and knowledge management; Knowledge-based computer models; Ontology; Project planning and design; Social welfare theory; Stakeholder management; Sustainable infrastructure development","Decision making; Design; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Semantics; Transportation; Benefit analysis; Computer models; Information and knowledge managements; Project planning; Social welfare; Stakeholder management; Sustainable infrastructure; Economic and social effects","El-Gohary, N.M.; Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of Illinois, 205 N.

We provide a conceptual framework for evaluating the communication strategies a (landlord) Port Authority (PA) relies on in the management of its relevant stakeholders and the adoption of disclosure to critical issues. The theoretical arguments are supported by empirical evidences from the Port of Rotterdam (PoR), i.e. a major port which leverages disclosure to successfully manage stakeholders and support the implementation of corporate strategy. The research questions are addressed using a content analysis on the annual reports (ARs) of PoR in the period 2000–2012. The overall research design enables the investigation of PA disclosure as a tool for managing the evolving interests of stakeholders from a longitudinal perspective. The PoR case shows that the relative importance of topics reported in the ARs change over time, as a result of external pressures and internal key events. The outcomes demonstrate the growing attention of PoR on topics relevant to the broader community (e.g. environment and safety/security) after a period characterised by a prominent focus on financial and governance issues. Besides, key breakthrough forces stimulating the shifts in landlord communication strategies are identified and discussed. Finally, by suggesting an indirect approach to evaluate how PA prioritises its salient stakeholders, the paper adds to extant port literature and brings methodological implications. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","disclosure; longitudinal analysis; Port Authority; salience; stakeholders",,"Satta, G.; Department of Economics and Business Studies, University of Genoa, Via Vivaldi 5, Italy",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",13675567,,,,"English","Int.

Yet there is currently no theoretical lens through which to understand the nature of - and psychological contributors to - these employee-stakeholder relationships at the individual level. Drawing on social identity theory, the proposed framework reveals that when an employee identifies strongly with the organization, this affects the way the employee views external stakeholders in the social landscape at work, resulting in some surprising consequences. Specifically, when organizational identification is heightened, an employee's engagement with external stakeholders will paradoxically become more adversarial and less collaborative. This effect can be attenuated, or even reversed, to the extent that (a) the employee construes that the stakeholder is an organizational member and (b) the organization's identity orientation is collectivistic. The proposed framework also reveals antecedents to an employee's construal of a stakeholder's membership in the organization - antecedents that are unique to the boundary-spanning context. © Academy of Management Review.",,,"Korschun, D.; Drexel UniversityUnited States",,"Academy of Management",03637425,,,,"English","Acad.

With fundamental design principles founded on definitive risk allocation, this transactional based approach fails to acknowledge or foster the cooperative relationships considered to be vital to the success of any project. Contractual design encourages stakeholders to defend their own individual interest to the likely detriment of project objectives. These failings are not disputed, however, given that trust is a fundamental requirement for human interaction the influence of trust is potentially important in terms of stakeholder relationships and ultimate project success. Trust is therefore examined within this context. A conceptual framework of trust is presented and subsequently used to code and analyse detailed, semi-structured interviews with multiple stakeholders from different projects. Using a phenomenological investigation of trust via the lived experiences of multiple practitioners, issues pertaining to the formation and maintenance of trust within traditionally procured construction projects are examined. Trust was found to be integral to the lived experiences of practitioners, with both good and bad relationships evident within the constructs of traditional procurement mechanisms. In this regard, individual personalities were considered significant, along with appropriate risk identification and management. Communication, particularly of an informal nature, was also highlighted. A greater emphasis on project team selection during the initial stages of a project would therefore be beneficial, as would careful consideration of the allocation of risk. Contract design would also be enhanced through prescriptive protocols for developing and maintaining trust, along with mandated mechanisms for informal communication, particularly when responding to negative events. A greater understanding regarding the consequences of lost trust and the intricacies of trust repair would also be of value. © 2015 Scott Strahorn, Thayaparan Gajendran and Graham Brewer.","Relationships; Traditional project procurement; Trust; Trust repair",,"Strahorn, S.; School of Architecture and Built Environment, University of NewcastleAustralia",,"Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors",22049029,,,,"English","Constr.

This study examines how the public's perceptions of the distributional fairness of the benefits of mining, procedural fairness in the interactions between the mining industry and society, and confidence in the governance arrangements surrounding the industry affect the public's trust in the mining industry and, in turn, their acceptance of mining activities at a national scale. The aim of this study was also to understand how the contexts in which mining companies operate influence the public's perceptions of and attitudes toward mining. To this end, large-scale national surveys were conducted in Australia (N = 5121), China (N = 5122), and Chile (N = 1598). The results reveal that the key predictors of the public's acceptance of the mining industry were found to be relatively low across all three countries. In addition, distributional fairness, procedural fairness, and confidence in governance were all found to affect acceptance of mining, both directly and indirectly, by influencing the level of public trust in the mining industry. The findings also reveal that each of these three elements predicted trust and acceptance to varying degrees across the three countries. This suggests that the different elements are variously important to the public in accepting mining activities in their own contextual landscapes, highlighting that acceptance of mining is highly context dependent. The relatively low public perceptions of the three key predictors further suggest that in order to achieve a more socially sustainable mining industry where social conflict around mining operations is minimised and the public is able to experience the benefits of resource development, both the mining industry and governments may need to review their own methods of engaging with citizens to build trust in those stakeholder relationships. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Acceptance; Distributional fairness; Governance; Procedural fairness; Social licence to operate; Trust","Acceptance; Distributional fairness; Governance; Procedural fairness; Social licence to operate; Trust","Zhang, A.; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), PO Box 883, Australia",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

A total of 85 relevant articles identified from eight peer-reviewed CEM journals between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed based on the number of articles published annually, institutional and regional contributions, citations, and categorization of research interests and methodologies. Analysis results indicated that developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, have enjoyed significant advantages in megaproject research because of their greater experience, while megaproject research in developing countries, such as Russia, India, Turkey, and Vietnam, remains weak or lacking. These results also revealed that many theory-based findings have been reported in five subareas; namely, construction and site management, cost and schedule management, risk analysis and management, innovation and utilization of information technology, and leadership and professional development. The subareas of organization and stakeholder management, project planning and procurement, and project monitoring and control remain to be promising domains for future research, particularly in developing countries which have yet to develop a research tradition.

This paper also introduces a new process framework that can be instrumental to practitioners and can be operationalised by researchers. Design/methodology/approach-The paper is underpinned by social strategy literature, the service-dominant (S-D) logic framework of value co-creation, stakeholder thinking and the creating shared value (CSV) framework. The process framework is based on the P.A.S.C.A.L. (perception, analysis, synthesis, choice, action and learning) decision-making process introduced by Goodpaster (1991). Findings-Although the evidence that we have presented shows that some clubs are already applying some of the strategies that are part of our process framework, the paper highlights further opportunities particularly for clubs with less-developed social schemes. Research limitations/implications-This paper is a conceptual paper based on an ongoing multi-case study of four English Premier League clubs. The evidence we introduce is to bring our proposed process framework to life. As implications for future research, the process framework can be tested empirically. Future studies might also focus on how the international footprint of the community trusts influences their strategic integration with the rest of the club. Lastly, the leader plus team might be used as a new unit of analysis in future research. Practical implications-This conceptual paper can mitigate the separation fallacy that decouples social schemes from football and commercial objectives. Our process framework illustrates how stakeholder relationships are governed and lead to value creation. The strategies within the CSV framework are a roadmap for expanding social and economic value co-creation. Social implications-Our process framework for collaborative value co-creation can guide practitioners on how to develop and implement their social strategies.

Acquiring another language provides the tools for interpreting that culture's values and rules guiding social engagement. Hundreds of millions of consumers are currently learning and using English as a second (or third, etc.) tongue. To what extent does this appropriation of English entail convergence towards the consumption values/behaviors of consumers living in the Anglo world? Objective: This international study examines the impact of language, specifically multilingualism, as a conveyor of culture and shaper of consumer behavior. Method: Over 2000 individual consumers were surveyed in eight countries (Sweden, Hungary, Greece, Mexico, Chile, Canada, Korea, and India). A quantitative questionnaire included an array of measures related to use of various languages, along with numerous items to tap each of the multifaceted cultural constructs and consumer dispositions, along with many food behaviors, and pertinent demographics. For each language (vernacular, English, and up to two others) two components (media, interpersonal) are linked to ethnic identity, global acculturation, consumer dispositions (cosmopolitanism, consumer ethnocentrism, and materialism), and the consumption of various foodstuffs. Results: Subsequent to factor and reliability analyses, a series of comparisons were made on the construct interrelationships, between high- and low- context languages, as well as between bilingual and multilingual consumers. The findings demonstrated that acquiring English espouses numerous values and behaviors characterizing global consumer culture, including enhanced materialism and cosmopolitanism, and diminished levels of consumer ethnocentrism and communication in the vernacular. Consistent with cultural integration, however, English usage promoted the interpersonal expression in minority tongues. The various languages considered-in isolation and in tandem-were significantly linked to food consumption and several acculturation patterns were identified. Conclusion: Asymmetries are present between monolingual Anglo-American marketers and their potentially bilingual/multilingual consumers. As consumer behavior becomes more global, its meaning remains partially embedded in local terms, even among English-fluent consumers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Bilingualism; Culture; English; Ethnic identity; Globalization; Language",,"Cleveland, M.; DAN Management Program, University of Western Ontario, Social Science Centre, 1151 Richmond Street, Canada",,"Elsevier Inc.",01482963,,JBRED,,"English","J.

To explain variation in a firm’s strategic response to institutional pressures and its engagement in Corporate Social Action, we focus on two factors: public ownership and media attention. Analysis of the largest publicly traded German firms indicates that greater public ownership reduces a firm’s propensity to engage in Corporate Social Action, while firms with less public ownership are more proactive in social engagement.

This paper aims to identify sustainability features and practices adopted in retirement villages and associated benefits to improve the life quality of older people. A case study of an existing retirement village 10 kms from Brisbane CBD was conducted involving a series of interviews with the village managers and residents together with documents relating to the village's operations and activities. The environmentally friendly features that were incorporated into the development mainly include green design for the site and floor plan and waste management in daily operation. More importantly, a variety of facilities are provided to strengthen the social engagement and interactions among the residents. Additionally, different daily services are provided to assist independent living and improve the health conditions of residents. Also, the relatively low vacancy rate in this village indicates that these sustainability features offer good value of money for the residents. The paper provides a first look at sustainable retirement villages in terms of triple bottom line sustainability with emphasis on social aspects, reveals the importance in maintaining an appropriate balance, and provides examples of how this can be achieved in practice.

The validity of a discipline’s constructs is a prerequisite for effective theory development and testing. Construct validity thus lies at the very heart of both decision-making and scientific progress in marketing. The use of marketing instruments that do not demonstrate sufficient evidence of construct validity can lead to invalid results, erroneous conclusions and poor decision-making. Despite several attempts to develop an instrument to measure the corporate reputation of service organizations effectively, lingering doubts remain about the construct validity of several published instruments. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical data were collected from the clients of service organization using an online survey during three waves of data collection and scale purification. Invariance testing in two different service industries confirmed that the final instrument is completely invariant, suggesting that the measurement parameters of the measurement model are the same in both samples. Findings – Rigorous scale development led to the development of a 19-item instrument that effectively measures a large service organization’s corporate reputation along five dimensions, namely, emotional appeal, corporate performance, social engagement, good employer and service points. Research limitations/implications – The study was limited to the measurement of the corporate reputation of large service organizations. Practical implications – Given the fact that corporate reputation has been described as “the ultimate determinant of competitiveness” by some executives, the outcome of this study is a proposal that large service organizations measure this intangible asset along five dimensions, namely, emotional appeal, corporate performance, social engagement, good employer and service points. Originality/value – Despite several attempts to do so, a valid and reliable instrument to effectively measure the corporate reputation of service firms (particularly large ones) has remained elusive. After more than two decades after the first attempts at measurement, there are many who now call for improved methodologies and more valid instruments to measure corporate reputation, based on more rigorous theoretical and conceptual development.

The strengths of the idea are highlighted in terms of its popularity among practitioner and academic audiences, its connecting of strategy and social goals, and its systematizing of some previously underdeveloped, disconnected areas of research and practice. However, the concept suffers from some serious shortcomings, namely: it is unoriginal; it ignores the tensions inherent to responsible business activity; it is naïve about business compliance; and it is based on a shallow conception of the corporation's role in society.

Knowledge on how Russian companies perceive and practice CSR is strongly limited. Thus, the objective of our study is to analyze to what degree the national political and socio-economic institutions determine CSR practice, and how it is influenced by international factors, such as CSR standards, frameworks, and foreign stakeholder expectations. Based on Whitley's national business systems approach, which we use as institutional theory framework, we examine the implementation of CSR in Russia's 50 largest companies. In specific, we investigate the areas of CSR in which Russian companies are active, what stakeholders they consider, the form and financial extent of their activities, the application of international standards, and how reporting is conducted. Our results show that awareness for CSR has been fostered by the influx of Western business concepts, but the understanding and practice of CSR is predominantly determined by the country's institutional environment. CSR mostly is an extension of traditional social roles that Russian business has assumed over decades, especially during communist times. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As opposed to local firms, multinational firms are usually exposed to global pressure groups both in home and host countries. In addition, in order to gain license to operate in foreign markets, they are required to be regarded as socially responsible agents that contribute to sustainable development. Finally, apart from the moral reasons, high levels of corporate social performance will lead multinational enterprises to increase their reputation and legitimacy in the areas where they have operations and consequently increase their revenues and levels of financial performance. Traditionally, the literature has focused on studying the relationship between international diversification and corporate results, with very few studies on the effects of internationalisation on firms’ social performance. The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of international cultural diversification of a multinational enterprise on its corporate social performance and to investigate the moderating effect of slack financial resources on this relationship. The present empirical analysis is based on a sample of 113 multinational enterprises from the United States that operate in the chemical, energy and industrial sectors. The results demonstrate that international cultural diversification is positively correlated with the social performance of firms and that a high level of slack financial resources leads multinational enterprises operating in markets with different cultural profiles to improve their corporate social performance. The implications for academia, managers and policy makers are discussed. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; International cultural diversification; Multinational enterprises; Slack financial resources",,"Aguilera-Caracuel, J.; Management and Marketing Department, Pablo de Olavide UniversitySpain",,"Gabler Verlag",09388249,,MINRA,,"English","Manage.

The way companies communicate through their reports indicates their level of commitment to Corporate social responsibility. The objective of this paper is to analyze companies' behavior towards Corporate social responsibility based on their disclosure practices. We define four possible types of behavior: Novice, Cautious, Chattering and Leading. These types are the result of the combination of two variables that measure the disclosure and credibility of Corporate social responsibility information. Our results indicate that companies listed in the stock market disclose more Corporate social responsibility information than private ones but with less credibility.

Findings from a survey of 281 restaurant patrons show that after a service failure, favorable corporate social responsibility (CSR) perception can help mitigate the negative effects of internal cause attribution on customer identification and ultimately contribute to post-recovery satisfaction. Besides, the interaction effect of CSR perception and attribution on C-C identification is particularly salient for customers with higher prior expectation.

Although the effect of corporate social responsibility on firm performance has been addressed from different perspectives, little is known about the influence of corporate social responsibility on organisational processes and internal operations of firms. The paper aims to make a link between corporate social responsibility, quality management practices and quality outcomes through emphasising quality citizenship as one of the practices associated with quality management. This paper provides a new perspective on the link between quality citizenship and product/process design within the quality management framework. The stakeholder theory of the firm is used to explain the formation and development of new management practices within a firm. Data were collected from managers in the petroleum industry to examine the role of quality citizenship on design and development of organisational processes. The results show that quality citizenship has a significant effect on employee involvement and an indirect effect on process design. Quality citizenship enables firms to obtain a much broader perspective on product/process design and facilitates design and development of products, services and processes that meet the needs of a broader set of customers - the stakeholders. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","quality citizenship","Process design; Product design; Quality management; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Design and Development; Effect on employees; Internal operations; Management practices; Quality management frameworks; Quality management practices; Stakeholder theory; Economic and social effects","Mellat-Parast, M.; Technology Management, North Carolina A and T State University, Greensboro, NC, United States; email: mahour@ncat.edu",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",00207543,,IJPRB,,"English","Int J Prod Res",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906314676

The development trajectories of such studies should be articulated with a view to informing practical corporate social responsibility applications and theoretical studies in the future. This paper presents a critical review of relevant empirical research articles on the nexus between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance published during the ten-year period from 2002 to 2011. Using mixed-methods of content analyses and statistical analyses, the paper reviews 84 empirical studies of this kind published during the period. The results indicate that, despite the enormous amount of previous studies, the corporate social performance and corporate financial performance nexus is a line of inquiry that remains inconclusive. The pattern of corporate social performance-corporate financial performance relationship research in the decade examined has shifted towards exploring the linkages between specific aspects of the two constructs. The positive relationships between these specific aspects in dual directions are confirmed by most of the studies examined in this paper. The paper also examines the impact of time and space change on the corporate social performance-corporate financial performance nexus. The findings show that researchers have gradually recognized that the relationship is not static but changes over time. Furthermore, the paper finds that corporate social responsibility has been increasingly debated in developing countries and in specified industrial settings. The review concludes that to explore the corporate social performance-corporate financial performance nexus by contextualizing it in a specified community, and/or examine its dynamics is a promising research area that can yield significant academic and practical values. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Given this situation, the present study proposes and finds that investors use additional cues, such as information about corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance, to form overall impressions about management's honesty, credibility, and trustworthiness. Similar to other findings in the halo effect literature, we find that these overall impressions subsequently influence both investors' assessments of financial disclosure credibility and the prices they are willing to pay for a company's stock. The findings support the theoretical framework on financial disclosure credibility by (1) showing that management credibility is an important tool that investors use to assess disclosure credibility and (2) suggesting that management credibility is a multidimensional latent construct for which CSR performance can be one of several relevant indicators. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","corporate social responsibility; financial disclosure credibility; halo effects; management credibility",,"Wang, L.; College of Business and Public Administration, Eastern Washington University, 668 N.

Much depends on the nature of their engagement. The stakeholder engagement process can be complex and unpredictable, more so if no strategic plan is put in place or if no systematic thinking is invested in the innovation. Stakeholder engagement in the innovation process in general and innovation diffusion in particular is examined in the context of construction. From a theoretical perspective, analysis of the effect of stakeholders could be expected to help in refining the innovation process so that it produces decisions and outcomes more likely to lead to successful innovation and diffusion. To cover diverse applications from product development to the drafting and implementation of national standards, 19 innovation projects were studied. Through a statistical analysis of stakeholder involvement, based on a Fisher's exact test, it was concluded that a structured process of engagement has to be an integral part of the innovation process. Accordingly, an explicit plan for communication and engagement with identified key stakeholders is necessary ex ante as a condition for successful innovation and diffusion. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction; Innovation diffusion; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder theory","Construction; Lead refining; Product development; Diverse applications; Innovation diffusion; Innovation projects; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder involvement; Stakeholder theory; Structured process; Systematic thinkings; Diffusion","Widén, K.; Division of Construction Management, P.O.

In this paper, we present a new model for analyzing the sustainability of infrastructure project alternatives from a stakeholder-centric perspective: the stakeholder-sensitive, social welfare-oriented sustainability benefit analysis model (S3 Model). The model evaluates infrastructure project alternatives based on a proposed sustainable construction social welfare function (SC-SWF). The SC-SWF is a measure of the collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to all stakeholders. It can help identify project solutions that offer social (group) welfare based on the social, environmental, and economic benefits to individual stakeholders. The theoretical foundation of the proposed SC-SWF is grounded in the areas of social choice theory and social welfare theory. The proposed model and its practical application are illustrated through a hypothetical case study. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by advancing the knowledge in the area of social welfare theory and the fundamental research in infrastructure system decision theory. The proposed analysis may guide infrastructure system decision making and may lead to better understanding of how to plan and design infrastructure systems in a way that maximizes the collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to stakeholders. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Benefit analysis; Project planning and design; Social choice theory; Social welfare theory; Stakeholder management; Sustainable infrastructure development","Algorithms; Decision making; Decision theory; Benefit analysis; Project planning; Social choice theory; Social welfare; Stakeholder management; Sustainable infrastructure; Sustainable development","El-Gohary, N.M.; Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N.

We undertake a focused review of the sustainability literature that integrates a variety of perspectives. Based on this review, we elaborate an illustrative corporate sustainability framework consisting of elements that are easily understandable and interpretable with respect to tangible corporate sustainability activities and actions. Using this framework we develop a concrete, comprehensive and multidimensional definition of corporate sustainability. Some implications of the sustainability framework for practitioners include the effects of incorporating sustainability into corporate strategy and external communications to corporate stakeholders; the consequences of including an organization's supply chain in sustainability efforts; an illustration of the potential synergy between innovation and sustainability; the consequences of incorporating economic, ecological- environmental, and equity-social concerns in strategic decisions and design processes; and the ramifications of serving as an industry thought leader in shaping sustainability regulatory policies. The framework proposed here can assist in the evaluation of sustainability activities, as well as serve as a guide for an organization that aspires to increase the level and sophistication of its sustainability activities. An important next step for academic sustainability research is to empirically validate the framework proposed here using a variety of methodologies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyse whether CSR in Palestine—a country under Israeli occupation and in a state of war that has lasted decades—possesses specific characteristics or follows the same model than Western countries. Besides, we have chosen Jordan in order to highlight possible differences between similar countries. Jordan and Palestine have a similar cultural context because many Palestinians have immigrated to Jordan, but the former is living in a state of stability and safety. The sample of the study consists of 101 companies; the data refers to 2011. Our results show that levels of CSRD in Jordan are higher than in Palestine in all aspects, though it is low in both countries when compared with Western countries. Both countries enhance the same issues but, in relative terms, Palestinian firms present a greatest concern on issues related to human resources and commitment towards community. Moreover, we have found a positive association between CSRD and the legal system, external auditor firm characteristics and corporate governance (e.g. board size and board audit committee).

This article conceptualizes brand social responsibility (BSR) and delineates it from CSR. Following the development of a BSR scale (Study 1), this research demonstrates variations in consumers’ social responsibility perceptions across product brands even if they are owned by the same corporation and compete in the same product category (Study 2). BSR is distinct from CSR (Studies 3a–3c), and better predicts consumers’ responses to product brands compared to corporate level measures (Study 4). Consistent with the conceptual distinction, this research demonstrates the unique contribution of BSR and CSR in predicting product brand and corporate outcomes, respectively (Study 5). From a theoretical viewpoint, this research is one of the few to examine differences between product brand and CSR. From a managerial viewpoint, the consideration of social responsibility at the product brand level facilitates the assessment of social responsibility perceptions across brands in brand portfolios managed under a mixed-branding or house-of-brands strategy. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Branding; Measurement; Social responsibility; Sustainability",,"Bodur, H.O.; John Molson School of Business, Concordia University, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.

Building on stakeholder theory, we distinguish two types of reputation—reputation among public stakeholders and reputation among financial stakeholders. We argue that CSP activities affect these two reputations differently. In addition, we empirically test the relationship among different types of CSP, reputation among public and financial stakeholders, and financial performance. Our results suggest that (1) Carroll’s four types of CSP (i.e., economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic) affect financial performance differently, and (2) their effects are mediated by reputation among public and financial stakeholders.

Because achieving success with CER investing is often a long-term process, we maintain that by effectively investing in CER, executives can decrease their firms’ environmental costs, thereby enhancing operating performance. By employing a unique environmental dataset covering 29 countries, we find that the reducing of environmental costs takes at least 1 or 2 years before enhancing return on assets. We also find that reducing environmental costs has a more immediate and substantial effect on the performance of financial services firms in well-developed financial markets than in less-developed financial markets. These results are economically and statistically significant and robust even after alleviating endogeneity and using an additional performance measure. We interpret our empirical results as supporting the social impact and reputation-building hypothesis.

Based on cluster analysis, we identify three heterogeneous employee segments, Idealists, Enthusiasts, and Indifferents, who vary in their multi-faceted job needs and, consequently, their demand for organizational CSR. We further find that an organization’s CSR programs generate favorable employee-related outcomes, such as job satisfaction and reduction in turnover intention, by fulfilling employees’ ideological and developmental job needs.

Focusing on Thailand, this article shows how corporate strategies aimed at greening consumption have become visible because of an increase in sustainable products, environmental information flows, and green narratives and images. We investigated two illustrative cases, dairy and appliance industries, and found that their environmental performances in greening consumption diverge. In the dairy industry, green products and environmental product information are mainly found among small producers for niche markets. Larger producers have only recently started adopting consumer-oriented environmental strategies. Appliance companies offer consumers not only green products, but also environmental information, storylines, and images reflecting general sustainability topics and, to a modest extent, consumer eco-lifestyles.

Drawing on the authenticity literature, we identify two core dimensions of authenticity that impact stakeholder perceptions of CSR: distinctiveness and social connectedness. Distinctiveness captures the extent to which a firm’s CSR activities are aligned with their core mission, vision and values while social connectedness refers to the degree to which an organization’s CSR efforts are embedded in a larger social context. We use this framework to explore the question ‘when are a firm’s CSR efforts most likely to be perceived as authentic by stakeholders?’ and find that both of these dimensions are necessary; social connectedness or distinctiveness alone are necessary but insufficient conditions for perceptions of authenticity to occur. A detailed exploration of authenticity, therefore, advances research in the CSR domain that may help mend the growing divide between business and society. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Authenticity; Business and society; Corporate social responsibility",,"Slawinski, N.; Faculty of Business Administration, Memorial University of NewfoundlandCanada",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Utilising an interview methodology with influential actors from seven export garment manufacturers in Sri Lanka, we explore the situated knowledge at one nodal point of the production network. We conceptualise factory management perspectives on the implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in terms of the strategic balancing of ethical considerations against the commercial pressures of cost and lead time. Factory managers framed CSR in terms of compliance, rather than going above and beyond regulatory requirements; seeing it as a strategic competitive imperative and less a developmental mechanism. Sri Lankan manufacturers maintain that they have benefitted from a unique combination of factors, including strict national labour laws, an educated workforce, the characteristics of the garments produced, industrial upgrading, and long-term non-adversarial buyer–supplier relationships, which they argue has supported the establishment and maintenance of CSR practices. The paper thus provides managerial implications that relate CSR activities to CSR outcomes which include both reputational and production benefits. Such insights will be of strategic relevance for lead retail buyers as well as apparel producers keen to invest in CSR to partly mitigate against increasing price-based competition. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethical sourcing; Retailing; Sri Lanka; Supply chain management",,"Wood, S.; Surrey Business School, University of SurreyUnited Kingdom",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

We also cited general opinions on corporate social responsibility from the heads of academic institutions and queried them regarding their methods to introduce and integrate it into business and management education and training. A survey of business and management schools in Pakistani universities revealed limited levels of corporate social responsibility within the business and management curricula. We found that the level of corporate social responsibility in Pakistan is representative of corporate social responsibility education in other developing countries. In Pakistan, there was consensus among the respondents on the importance of incorporating corporate social responsibility as a future discipline to encourage sustainable socioeconomic development in the country.

Prescriptions for the repair of trust are offered along with the diagnosis. Design/methodology/approach – The theoretical underpinnings of the stakeholder trust model of organizations are supported using the literature in marketing and management. Case study data on large and community banks are used to explore differences in these type of banks as they relate to trustworthiness as articulated in the stakeholder trust model of organizations. Findings – The stakeholder trust model of organizations and six dimensions of trustworthiness help to explain why trust eroded in large banks during the GFC but increased or remained stable among some community banks. This diagnosis of the loss of trust also points to interventions that will be necessary to restore trust going forward among large banks. Research limitations/implications – Scholars in marketing need to develop a more macro view of the firm that examines trust beyond customers to reflect a wider stakeholder focus and issues of corporate social responsibility, trust reputation and license to operate. Practical implications – This paper points out strategic changes, some of which are radical, that will be required to restore and sustain stakeholder trust in large banks. Social implications – Building trustworthy banks is essential to social and economic progress. Originality/value – This paper addresses a void in marketing research by moving beyond the product and transactional level focus and framing a more macro oriented approach to understand trust in banks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Banks; Business ethics; Customer satisfaction; Financial services; Market orientation; Trust",,"Hurley, R.; Department of Management, Fordham UniversityUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02652323,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947077632

To this end, we argue that a shared understanding amongst stakeholders concerning complexity and risk is both urgent and mutually beneficial. Ideally it would lead to collaborative design of curriculum and pedagogy and avoid overly narrow specialisation. We use the notion of 'holism' to explore the difficulties in comprehending the span of change in contemporary business, presenting 'holistic risk' as a vital but aspirational construct transcending boundaries, functions and disciplines. Specifically we address implications for teaching and learning holistic risk, for related program goals and curriculum design, and for embedding critical analytical skills into curriculum, arguing that students engage with holistic risk throughout the entire spectrum of problem-solving. Thus, educators must grapple with helping students in this effort. In support, we offer examples of our own practice in curriculum design and pedagogy. We conclude that the concept of holism might provoke a better understanding between educators and industry stakeholders concerning knowledge and skills to deal with risks associated with dynamic shifts in business environments.

Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm’s board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm’s board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances.

The managerial action as a result of such strategic cognition suggests that modern organizations are seeking to develop CSR giving processes that provide them with a competitive advantage. We draw on the resource-based view of organizations and the VRIO framework to provide the theoretical foundations for our argument that CSR implementation in the form of corporate giving to charities can be developed as a dynamic capability. This can provide a competitive advantage by allowing organizations to manage key stakeholder relationships (external and internal) more effectively with benefits which could lead to increased organizational productivity and the ability to execute strategy more effectively. We interview CSR implementation managers from large organizations in Australia and find that the CSR giving process in many firms is evolving into a more sophisticated and strategically motivated process with expectations of a return. Central to this evolution is the appointment of a CSR implementation manager who acts as a boundary spanner between the organization and its key stakeholders. We posit that this corporate investment in their role and supporting structures can lead to the better management of stakeholders by organizations through the dynamic capability of the CSR giving process.

Extant research demonstrates that CR is one of the key mediators between CSR and important organizational outcomes, which ultimately improve organizational performance. Yet, hitherto the research focused on CR construct has been plagued by multiple definitions, conflicting conceptualizations, and unclear operationalizations. The purpose of this article is to provide theoretical ground for positioning of CR as an assessment construct that is modeled as a second-order factor affecting individual first-order dimensions (having a reflective nature), and to provide methodological and empirical support toward such conceptualization. We assert that intangible, socially complex, and causally ambiguous CR (latent construct) can be accurately estimated through its individual measurable dimensions. Using survey data from Peru, we empirically test the hypothesized second-order reflective model within a hierarchy of nested and non-nested models, and compare its model fit and predictive power (nomological validity) with alternative conceptualizations. Modeling CR as a second-order reflective construct relies on a set of theoretical propositions and yields several methodological advantages, including strong conceptual interpretability and parsimony when tested within a nomological context. We explicitly demonstrate positive organizational outcomes of CR: customer trust, corporate identification, in-role behavior, and extra-role behavior. Then, we demonstrate that the shorter scales of CR can be used as a good proxy for the full construct measure. The paper concludes by highlighting theoretical insights, and methodological and managerial implications of the findings. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate identification; Corporate reputation; Extra-role behavior; In-role behavior; Organizational reputation; Reflective versus formative construct; Trust",,"Osiyevskyy, O.; Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary, 2500 University Dr NW, Canada",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Many of these dilemmas concern the capital that is generated (or the lack of it) through variations in the use of ethnic stakeholder social ties. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a stakeholder-based model of social capital formation, mediated by various forms of ethnic ties, to explore the duality of ethnicity: it can aid and hinder an ethnic business. Drawing upon the social capital/economic development, stakeholder salience, ethnic businesses literatures, and (to some extent) on social identity theory, we develop a cyclical model of relationships among ethnic business stakeholder attributes (ethnic kinship-based power, ethnic-moral legitimacy, and ethnic-critical urgency) and social capital, as mediated by three-way (triadic) Simmelian bonding and bridging ties, which then, in turn, affects the ethnic stakeholder attributes. We argue that the development of bridging yet strong ties through this cyclical process is relevant for the improvement of the positions of ethnic businesses in terms of both economic success and social responsibility. Specifically, we suggest that, given the duality of ethnicity in business, managers can prioritize stakeholder relationships based upon how these stakeholder ties affect social capital. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ethnic business; Ethnic-based social dilemmas; Simmelian ties; Social capital; Stakeholder salience",,"Marin, A.; SolBridge International School of Business, Woosong Educational Foundation, Dong-gu, Uam-ro 128 (Samsung-dong), South Korea",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

In January 2013 a precedent was set when Shell was held liable in The Hague for oil pollution in the Niger Delta. The landmark ruling climaxed the ongoing dispute over the scope of Shell’s responsibilities for both the company’s positive and negative impact. Shell’s was considered a forerunner in corporate social responsibility and had even assumed public responsibilities in a context of a public responsibility void. However, the company remained a regular target of civil society activism and legal proceedings concerned with malpractice. The court case attracted international attention for its novelty and increasing media and civil society pressure required immediate action. How can Shell respond to this negative publicity to keep its license to operate? What is the scope of the company’s responsibilities in such a controversial human rights context? Students are expected to discuss these questions going beyond a simple moralistic or liability thinking. They are encouraged to take into account the complex structural processes that connect persons and institutions in very different social and geographical positions. The experiences of Shell are an excellent case in point since attention is drawn to the background conditions of globally operating companies, in which the isolation of perpetrators based on causality is not realistic. The case also reveals the particular challenges, which MNCs face in the context of increasing demands to take on public responsibilities while respecting their economic mandate. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate legitimacy; Corporate social responsibility; Political role of multinational companies; Public responsibility deficit; Public responsibility strategy; Sustainability",,"Hennchen, E.; Institute for Social Innovation, ESADE Business SchoolSpain",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

By extending the scope of its inquiry into high politics, the insights from PCSR research could enrich the debates in several other social sciences that also study political roles of private companies.

Advancing the discourse on corporate social responsibility reporting, we examine how family influence on a business organization affects CSR reporting. The arguments developed here draw on institutional theory, using a rich body of empirical evidence gathered through a content analysis of the CSR reports of 98 large- and medium-sized Italian firms. The grounded theory analysis informs and contextualizes several differences in the type and content of corporate social responsibility reports of family and non-family firms. Our findings show that in comparison to non-family firms, family firms disseminate a greater variety of CSR reports, are less compliant with CSR standards and place emphasis on different CSR topics. We, thus, contribute to the family business and corporate social responsibility reporting literatures in several ways, offering implications for practice and outlining promising avenues for future research. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Content analysis; CSR reporting; Family business; Family firms; Italian context; Social responsibility",,"Campopiano, G.; Witten Institute for Family Business, Witten/Herdecke UniversityGermany",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

The findings demonstrate that corporate social responsibility image influences customer identification with the company, the emotions evoked by the company and satisfaction positively. Identification also influences the emotions generated by the service performance and customer satisfaction determines loyalty behaviour. The findings have significant implications for service managers because they demonstrate that there are two paths to explain the satisfaction and loyalty of service customers.

While opponents of insider trading claim that the buying or selling of a security by insiders who have access to non-public information is illegal, proponents argue that insider trading improves economic efficiency and fairness when corporate insiders buy and sell stock in their own companies. Based on extensive U.S. data of insider trading and CSR engagement, we find that both the number of insider transactions and the volume of insider trading are positively associated with CSR activities.We also find that legal insider transactions are positively related to CSR engagement even after controlling for potential endogeneitybias and various firm characteristics. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that firms perceive adjustment to CSR dimension of product as being efficient, while adjustment to diversity and environmental CSR as being inefficient. Our results of bad and illegal insider trading proxies are consistent with the interpretation that firms with high CSR ratings do not attempt to engage in unethical or bad insider trading in a significant fashion.

Using survey data from Chinese family-owned firms, I provide strong and consistent evidence to show that corporate environmental misconduct is significantly positively associated with corporate philanthropic giving, suggesting that some Chinese family-owned firms act philanthropically to divert public attention from their environmentally unfriendly behavior. Moreover, the positive association between corporate environmental misconduct and corporate philanthropic giving is less pronounced for politically connected family-owned firms than for their counterparts. The above results are robust to various sensitivity tests. My findings suggest that environmental misconduct dressing may be an additional motivation for corporate philanthropic giving and that different dimensions of corporate social responsibility may be inherently inconsistent in the given institutional setting. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","China; Corporate philanthropic giving; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Environmental misconduct; Family-owned firms; Political connections",,"Du, X.; Center for Accounting Studies and Accounting Department, School of Management, Xiamen University, No. 422, Siming South Road, China",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Prior research suggests that CSR, by its ability of building strong corporate image and reputation, effectively improves a firm's performance. However, few studies have explored the relationship between CSR and firm risk factors. In particular, although the ongoing financial crisis spurs scholars to seek new drivers that help a firm regain its well being, an important financial indicator of a firm, default risk, has been largely neglected. This research bridges this gap and empirically examines the relationship through which CSR helps firms reduce the risk of falling into default. In addition, this paper formulates the moderating effects between CSR and firm capability, environmental dynamism/complexity, and describes a more complete pattern of CSR's function under different internal and external conditions. The results confirm that CSR has a strong effect on default risk reduction, and this relationship is stronger on firms in high dynamism environments than in low dynamism environments. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Default risk; Environmental complexity; Environmental dynamism; Firm capability",,"Sun, W.; Helzberg School of Management, Rockhurst University, 1100 Rockhurst Road, Kansas City, MO, United States; email: wenbin.sun@rockhurst.edu",,,02632373,,,,"English","Eur.

We theorize that institutional mechanisms of practice diffusion underlying relational networks and filtered by organizational characteristics influence the adoption of practices that are more customized (tailored) or less customized (turnkey). We hypothesize, first, that organizations participating in extra-industry professional networks will, through normative conformity, be more likely to adopt turnkey practices; second, that the normative pressure of professional networks will interact with the mimeticism of industry peers such that organizations will be more likely to adopt tailored practices; and third, that organizational filters will affect adoption of all practices. Using unique survey data from 161 Fortune 500 organizations, supplemented by archival and qualitative data, we focus on two corporate social responsibility practice variants. We find significant support for our first two hypotheses and mixed support for our third: Organizational infrastructure and identity significantly affect practice adoption, albeit in different ways, but only marginal support for leadership and elite organizational status.

This result serves to motivate two game-theoretic models demonstrating that (1) the trade-off between risk and expectation in developing a competitive advantage and (2) the shape of this risk each define a different and previously unexplored dimension of differentiation along which firms choose distinctive competitive positions. Two other important aspects of market rivalry-the number of competing firms and their product market overlap-affect where firms position themselves and which firms have higher expected profit than others. The analysis offers a risk-based theory of the origins of competitive advantage among initially identical rival firms and sheds light on the empirical evidence regarding both the relationship between risk and profitability and the performance implications of corporate social responsibility. © Academy of Management Review.",,,"Ross, D.G.; Columbia Business SchoolColombia; email: dr2175@columbia.edu",,"Academy of Management",03637425,,,,"English","Acad.

This review summarizes and integrates the results of studies focusing on NPOs' governance effectiveness. It proposes an extension of stakeholder theory to NPOs concerning governance involving diverse stakeholder groups. What makes this paper innovative is that it aims to identify more than effective board governance, and takes the perspectives of multiple nonprofit key stakeholders into account. This approach is particularly valuable as numerous researchers argue that the likelihood of NPOs being perceived as effective increases when they manage to align the, possibly very diverse, expectations of stakeholders on good governance. We consequently focus on the relationship between (1) the needs and objectives of key stakeholders and (2) (expected) governance (structures) in NPOs. The stakeholders we consider are government, beneficiaries, private donors, board members, management, volunteers, and non-managerial staff members. Results not only show the lack of attention some stakeholders have received in the literature, but also the governance related conflicting needs and objectives between stakeholder groups. In addition, even in the same stakeholder groups it is not rare that opposing findings are reported. Several studies indicate the (unforeseen) negative impact on (being accountability to) other stakeholders when NPOs try to be responsive to the needs and objectives of a particular stakeholder group. The value of this review lies in the fact that it reveals both the complexity of and the need for stakeholder management in NPOs, if they want to be perceived as (more) effective by their numerous stakeholders, and related to that gain insight in how to improve their governance practices.

I argue that there are serious reasons to doubt the existence of genuine moral dilemmas both in the abstract, as well as in the context of managerial responsibility.

Drawing on stakeholder theory, we develop hypotheses about (a) market investor reaction to the disclosure of new, relevant corporate environmental performance in both the short and longer (6–12-month) term, (b) whether market investors’ reaction reflects industry context, and (c) whether firm-level contextual variables representing firm size, and market legitimacy significantly impacts the investor reaction. We find that, for the sample of the largest 500 US firms ranked by Newsweek, investors react positively both to the raw and within-industry rankings of green performance in terms of both short-term and longer-term (up to 12 months) returns. Moreover, the investor reaction is significantly influenced by contextual variables such as firm size and firm market legitimacy. Our results are compatible with the inference that rating agencies like Newsweek serve a valuable information dissemination function such that investors in better ranked firms anticipate larger future cash flows due to more positive reactions from key stakeholders such as environmentally-conscious customers, employees, NGOs, regulators, and thus reward these firms with stock price increases. Finally, larger, more visible firms benefit more, while firms which have more market legitimacy (represented by past financial performance) benefit less.

In this exploratory study, we attempt to determine whether there is movement toward normativity by examining the change in CSR disclosure from 2004 in comparison to 2010 for a sample of 81 publicly traded French firms. We measure both the space and the quality of CSR disclosures, including in the latter a measure based on informational quality attributes as discussed by the International Accounting Standards Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Global Reporting Initiative. We find significant increases in the space allocated to CSR disclosure, as well as some evidence of increased quality; although the informational quality of the disclosures remains quite low and fewer firms are including negative performance information in their reports. Finally, we document that differences in disclosure space and quality in 2004 appeared to be associated with legitimacy-based variables and that those relations remain largely unchanged in 2010.

This study examines the process by which this alignment is sought by CSR managers in the CSR strategy-making process. Through reliance on stakeholder management theories, and with a particular focus on how and why managers communicate with stakeholders, the extent to which the company-stakeholder alignment process in CSR strategy-making reflects modern, enlightened approaches to stakeholder relations is assessed. This assessment is based on an analysis of structured, in-depth interviews with CSR managers from sixteen industry-leading, Danish companies. The managers' descriptions of their interactions with stakeholders reveal that their practices fall short of the normative, theoretical ideals since their focus is primarily on just listening to others in the strategy-making process rather than directly involving others in decision-making. Also, because non-stakeholders, such as paid-for consultants, are found to be note-worthy influencers in the CSR strategy-making process, it is concluded that the process is not only a stakeholder management exercise, but an expert, institutionalized, strategic issues management exercise as well. © 2013.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR strategy; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder management; Strategic issues management",,"Trapp, N.L.; Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University, Jens Chr.

Findings based on a sample of 275 large publicly listed U.S. firms reveal that family firms outperform non-family firms during recessions. This superior performance is partially driven by family firms' proactive marketing behavior and their relatively strong emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR). During recessions, while non-family firms tend to decrease their advertising intensities and rates of new product introduction (NPI), family firms are likely to maintain relatively high levels of advertising intensity and rates of NPI. Unlike non-family firms, family firms are also likely to maintain high levels of corporate social performance (CSP) during recessions. These results underscore the benefits of proactive marketing behavior and a continued emphasis on CSR during economic downturns.

It is apparently difficult for young people to differentiate between the activities of the various parties offering financial advice.

The natural tendency is to approach the subject of leadership as a hierarchically-based process that is focused on higher-level individual leaders influencing lower-level followers. This tendency is consistent with myths surrounding charismatic and heroic visionary leaders who are often portrayed as single-handedly inspiring and directing their organizations to new heights. Unfortunately, these simplistic portrayals of leadership are promulgated by the media and desired by the consuming public. However, this kind of framing of leadership is dangerous: it lays the seeds of centralization of power, which can have innumerable detrimental outcomes.

This line of research is important since firms continue to invest in CSR even though past studies reveal a limited linkage between financial value and CSR. However, the business case for CSR or ""doing good while making a profit,"" appears to be advancing within the business ethics literature as a preferred conception of CSR. We conjecture that the greater unification and refinement of both profit maximization and stakeholder interests through corporate acts, not statements alone, will sustain the financial value of CSR in a less regulated global business environment. We study the triangle of what companies say, what companies do, and firm financial performance. We analyze Fortune 250 firms and find a positive association between what companies do based on KLD Research and Analytics, Inc. (KLD) ratings, and what companies state about ethics in their CSR statements. We then employ regression analysis and find that companies' socially responsible acts are positively associated with overall firm value and financial performance. Yet we do not find a statistically significant association between what companies say regarding ethics in their CSR statements and their financial outcomes. These results suggest that firm value and financial performance is associated with what companies do and not what they say. Our results seem to be driven by multinational corporations (MNCs) and not by non-MNCs. This is possibly because MNCs generally operate in a less regulated global business environment that often necessitates strong ethical corporate leadership to further stakeholder interests. Overall, these results help reconcile corporate and stakeholder objectives since evidence of a link between financial performance and doing good sustains global CSR. © 2014 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,,"Sawyer Business School, Suffolk University, Boston, MA, United States",,,00453609,,,,"English","Bus.

Friedman's position, nevertheless, has retained currency among many business thinkers. In this article, we argue that Friedman's economic writings assume an economy in which businesses operate under the protections of limited liability, which allows corporations to privatize their gains while externalizing their losses. By accepting limited liability, Friedman must also accept a view of business as embedded in social interdependency, which serves as the logical and moral foundation for corporate social responsibility (CSR). To achieve consistency with his economic principles, Friedman must either abandon limited liability or modify his doctrine on CSR and his related shareholder model of business. © 2014 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,,"Department of Business, University of Navarra, Campus Universitario, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain",,,00453609,,,,"English","Bus.

However, ethical theories and perspectives from these different systems are rarely discussed in relation to each other, even though in practice these systems constantly interact. This paper explores ethical theories and perspectives that may apply to the WDP-RTW field, and discusses these in relation to perspectives attributed to dominant stakeholders in this field, and to potential differences in different jurisdictional contexts. Literature was sought primarily in biomedical ethics, business ethics, and public administration ethics. In biomedical ethics, four ethical principles are dominant: autonomy, beneficence, nonmalevolence, and justice. Business ethics involve theories on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), social contracts, and organizational justice. Public administration ethics focus on constitutional theory, citizenship, social equity, virtue, and public interest. Several concepts were identified as relevant for ethical analyses in the WDP-RTW field, including justice; individual autonomy; nonmalevolence; economic and social responsibility; and social contracts. These concepts provide a vocabulary that may be used to analyze stakeholders' actions and interactions in RTW processes. It was also noted how the power balance between stakeholders will influence which ethical perspectives will influence RTW. Jurisdictional differences that influence RTW processes with regard to stakeholder responsibilities were identified, as well as varying beliefs as to who is the client in different compensation systems. A social contractual approach may inform an analysis of cultural and legal differences. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business; Ethics; Medicine; Public administration; Social insurance; Work disability",,"Ståhl, C.; National Centre for Work and Rehabilitation, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linköping University, 581 83 Linköping, Sweden; email: christian.stahl@liu.se",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

There is belief that the contract prequalification process via a questionnaire (PQQ) concentrates it social criteria mainly on health and safety requirements. The perceived extent of internal and external benefits of CSR practices are investigated, with workforce and community issues, respectively, ranking the best. However, the perceived value for money (VFM) from a contractor perspective of such practices is poorand, therefore, is a major obstacle to motivation for improving performance beyond requirements.

The main results support Abidin's broader concept of GB (2005) and suggest that there is potential for integrating GB and corporate social responsibility in the construction sector; thus we add affordable housing as an additional element in the economic dimensions. Our results further verify the crucial role that the UK government has played in GB formation, promotion and development and showed a positive increase in using wood in the UK construction sector, supporting the notion that the environmental performance of wood is the major driver in embracing wood in the GB concept. In addition, we showed that experts who have sound knowledge of wood as a building material agree on its superior environmental credentials; however, end users who may lack information and knowledge of wood products often show strong prejudice against its use. Finally, we demonstrated that the major drivers promoting wood as a sustainable solution for GB in the UK construction sector include legislation, environmental awareness, attitudes and traditions, market and competition, promotion and communication, and technology and know-how. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To turn the latent construct 'transparency of CSR reporting' into a measurable value, we conduct qualitative content analysis based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines.

Numerous legislations in support of mining in the Philippines that were passed through the years have proven ineffective in spurring development in the industry. Despite the spotted history of mining in the Philippines, the rising prices of precious metals in the world would seem that mining as a venue for output is as lustrous as ever. Due to the economic downturn in the mid 2000s, the markets turned their attention back to heavy investments in metals, causing most of them to hit their all-time highs. Unfortunately, mining in the Philippines is a noted underperformer during the periods of growth, which can be attributed to the fact that it is a young industry but with many concerns tied to it as well. Most of the concerns lie within the protection of the environment. The ISO guidelines to mining led many countries into levying taxes that would attribute to pollution and the Philippines is no exception. By using the 1994 input-output table for the Philippines and the Computable General Equilibrium model developed by Cororaton (2003), this study finds that the Mining Act of 1995 has negative welfare implications on households and different sectors. The government should reconsider some parts of the Mining Act of 1995, specifically the liberalization of investing in the industry; more particularly, allowing foreign-owned corporations to claim mineral rights in the country. Financial institutions may design instruments that will cater to the specific needs of the potential domestic investors. Mining firms, together with the government, should implement programs for the communities near areas with mineral exploration activities and other corporate social responsibility programs to spur economic development that is the ultimate goal of our country. © 2014 by De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines.","Computable general equilibrium; Mining; Philippine Mining Act of 1995",,"Maison Sciences Des Economiques, Universite Paris 1-Pantheon-SorbonneFrance",,,01167111,,,,"English","DLSU Bus.

Design/methodology/approach: Respondents were 238 senior undergraduates studying in three discipline areas at an Australian metropolitan university. Their CSR values were explored in the context of a hypothetical job choice scenario. Findings: While the majority of students rated CSR values highly in the job choice scenario, a larger majority were willing to trade this off for greater extrinsic benefits. Among millennial job-seeking students, workplace practices were rated the most important CSR dimension with environmental issues ranking last. Significant differences were found between gender and discipline. Research limitations/implications: Quantitative analysis only; use of cross-sectional, single-source data. Practical implications: In the context of greater extrinsic rewards, CSR values (particularly environmental concerns) are not front-of-mind in millennial students' job choice decisions. This, coupled with high levels of indecision among business students may provide an important theoretical and practical basis for the development of CSR curricula in business courses in Australia.

The purpose of this study is to explore the indirect effects of different dimensions of CSR on brand loyalty in a real business context. This study focuses on legal and ethical responsibilities as two dimensions of social responsibility. The empirical results indicate that consumers' perceived legal and ethical responsibilities of brands may improve brand loyalty through enhancing positive functional and symbolic images. Moreover, corporate legally responsible behaviour helps to enhance a more functional image perceived by consumers than a symbolic image, while ethically responsible action impacts a symbolic image more than a functional image. These results suggest firms should focus on key dimensions of social responsibility based on the expectations of consumers in their marketing programmes. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","brand loyalty; corporate social responsibility; ethical responsibility; functional image; legal responsibility; symbolic image",,"He, Y.; School of Management, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Luoyu Road 1034, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China; email: heyuanqiong@mail.hust.edu.cn",,,14783363,,TQMAE,,"English","Total Qual.

More recently, these industries have begun to recognize the importance of adapting CSR efforts to unique local contexts rather than applying a one-size-fits-all model. However, firms understand local context to mean culture and treat the physical properties of the host region-topography, geology, hydrology, and climate-as the exclusive purview of mineral geologists and engineers. In this article, we examine the organization of CSR at two industrial-scale gold mines in Guatemala, owned by the same firm, which yielded starkly distinct levels of support among host community residents. We develop the idea of social terrain to convey the way in which the biophysical environment informs local social relations and imbues phenomena with particular social meanings. We argue that firms must account for social terrain in organizing for CSR. The literature struggles to provide guidelines for identifying and understanding stakeholders.

We draw on theories of normative influence and reciprocity to identify how firms positively influence the relations between their internal and external stakeholders. We propose that firms can send credible corporate signals, such as philanthropy and sustainability reporting, to exert social influence on employees, but that employees' own treatment by their firm and career prospects are also important in shaping their behavior toward the external community. We investigate these arguments in the context of Chinese firms' donation behavior following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Empirical analysis shows that the credibility of corporate signals differs. Sustainability reporting that adheres to global standards has a direct bearing on employees' behavior. In contrast, corporate giving by itself has no general influence on the willingness of employees to donate. However, firms that have either positive employee relations or have employees with superior career prospects and make donations to earthquake relief stimulate their employees to make their own donations too. In so doing, firms gain from the efforts of internal stakeholders to serve external stakeholders.

In this context and in view of a strategic and profound embedding of the CSR-concept, this study proposes a conceptual CSR framework, mainly on the basis of the recently published umbrella guideline ISO 26000. The proposed model for practice goes beyond the limitations of traditional PDCA cycles, through applying interconnected soft and hard factors as building blocks within a circular framework, thereby aiming to reduce the gap between the execution of loose sustainable initiatives and the application of a sustainability balanced scorecard. The framework has been named 'Sus5', as it connects five inherent features of sustainable business (management knowledge & commitment, stakeholder knowledge & commitment, strategic planning, knowledge & commitment on the work floor, and operational execution & monitoring). The added empirical study, which has been executed within the Flemish business landscape, reflects on the average Flemish as-is attention for each independent proposed building block, thereby aiming to retrieve in which extent the attention areas of the average company are aligned with the ones of Sus5 as the basis for drawing conclusions on the general feasibility level of applying Sus5. Through its intuitive and pragmatic character, Sus5 might in this context firstly serve as a practical tool for organizations to undertake a self-assessment and detect possible gaps in their CSR-policy, secondly to motivate them to shift the emphasis to a broader set of attention areas, based on the realization that a thorough CSR policy consists of a set of interdependent building blocks, being bonded by causal relations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, a corporation's success in adopting green practices depends not only on corporate attitudes towards environmental issues but also on its employees' personal beliefs and everyday actions. This study fills the gap in existing research by adopting the concept of a ""green organisational climate"" and using personal belief variables to explore the contextual and individual variation in hotel employees' environmental behaviour. The results from two-level linear hierarchical models (HLM) show that individual- and group-level factors are significantly associated with the employees' environmental beliefs and behaviour. In other words, personal environmental norms explain within-hotel variance, but green organisational climates explain between-hotel variance and moderate the effect of personal environmental norms on employees' environmental behaviour.

Managerial implications suggest that nonprofits employing negative emotional appeals in advertising should (1) feature real victims (not actors) to generate empathy and (2) target more religious individuals through demographic and psychographic segmentations. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Advertising; Nonprofit; Religion; Social responsibility",,"Hopkins, C.D.; Department of Marketing, College of Business and Behavioral Science, 257 Sirrine Hall, Box 341325, Clemson, SC 29634-1325, United States; email: chopkin@clemson.edu",,,01482963,,JBRED,,"English","J.

Changes in institutional arrangements in society affect the perceived responsibilities of firms to their personnel. In this study, we examine mass media discussions about firm-employee relationships from a social responsibility perspective via a longitudinal study in Romanian society. Our analysis indicates how the expected responsibilities of firms towards employees have altered with the changing role of firms in society since the early 1990s. These transformations correspond to the ideological developments, from communist to market-based thinking, which have taken place in post-communist Eastern Europe. More specifically, our study shows how the diminishing expectations of corporate social responsibility (CSR) are linked in mass media to increasingly important talk of human resource management (HRM). HRM is a modern business approach believed to address personnel needs and organisational objectives simultaneously. The congruency of goals in HRM may mistakenly lead to the conclusion that organisations are inherently responsible toward their personnel. We argue that this may not necessarily be the case. HRM, matching well the new free-market ideology in post-communist Eastern Europe, was eagerly embraced in that it defined firm-personnel relationships. In this study, we question whether this was an adequate theoretical perspective for Romanian firms to adopt as it lacks sufficient ethical grounding. We also call for a higher awareness concerning the role of mass media in the management literature, since its current role in constructing the 'rightness' and 'wrongness' in firm-personnel relationships is hardly considered. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business media; Corporate social responsibility; Employees; Firm-employee relationships; Human resource management; Ideology; Romania",,"Apostol, O.; Institute for Advanced Social Research, University of Tampere, 33014 Tampere, Finland; email: oana.apostol@uta.fi",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

In a further step, it explores how ethical consumption and public procurement can be associated and used to foster sustainable development. The paper presents the outcomes of the first stage of the project, an extensive literature review considering the developing trends towards ""ethical"", ""sustainable"", ""responsible"" and ""conscious"" consumption in both countries. Chile and Brazil are former developing countries, and although they both now have growing ethical consumption movements, we argue that these are shaped by the specificities of each country's political, economic and institutional trajectories. In one case, Chile, ethical consumption has arisen from market forces, with lead actors being companies, consultancies and citizen and consumer organizations. Brazil, on the other hand, provides also a very interesting case for studying how ethical consumption is embedded in another Latin American context: it has a larger state sector and a domestic market size to give the state, and thus the consecutive centre-left governments, great regulatory power, since it can control firms' access to this market. Both cases showed the increasing role of corporate social responsibility discourses and practices interfacing with concepts of ethical consumption. As a consequence, the paper identifies a risk of firstly, ""greenwash"" and ""whitewash"" by large companies and secondly, of having small producers struggling to market their products. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Many policies and strategies for sustainable everyday life have been initiated by governments and businesses, mainly based on technological innovations for reducing environmental impacts of production processes, designing better products, and providing infrastructure for collective services. There is, however, a growing recognition that sustainable lifestyles can be shaped not only through technological innovation, but also through social innovation. Social innovation is an emergent field of academic research and everyday practice that aims to meet social needs more effectively than existing solutions by engaging the power of social actors, stimulating interactions among them and enabling dynamic social processes. Social innovation is often seen as an important contribution to sustainable living at the local level, but only as a niche with little immediate relevance for advancing large-scale societal change at regime and landscape levels. By employing a participatory backcasting approach, the present research challenges this perception and aims to demonstrate the importance of social innovation processes and stakeholder engagement in envisioning the evolution of mainstream sustainable lifestyles from existing and emerging sustainable practices.

Moreover, the study is one of the first examining the role of context in employee attitudes toward CSR. In particular, it builds on the psychology of CSR (e.g. Rupp et al. 2013) literature to propose a research framework that delineates the moderating effects of satisfaction with payment, satisfaction with the job itself and individualism in the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) perceptions and customer-facing employees' behavioral outcomes.

Using data of listed companies in China, this paper examines whether CSR behavior in the form of charitable donations garners a positive reaction from suppliers. Results derived from both level and change model regressions show that superior CSP makes it easier for a firm to obtain trade credit from suppliers, although the effect is significant only in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). The results are robust to various measures of CSP and endogeneity tests. The results support the strategic philanthropy view and apply stakeholder theory in supply chain, that strategic CSR can help firms to attract suppliers and consolidate cooperative relationships with them, which in turn benefits the firms in terms of more trade credit financing from suppliers. This paper also shows that state-owned enterprises and non-SOEs have different CSR intentions and use CSR to achieve strategic goals in different ways.

However, the development of the model has not kept pace with the literature on social and environmental responsibility. This study builds on an argument that if corporate social responsibility in general - in which CSP plays an important role - is to respond to the challenges of sustainable development, the CSP of businesses could be more profoundly planned in order to design knowledge outcomes that contribute to meeting those challenges.

A review of the extensive literature in this field reveals that the conceptualisation of corporate approaches to responsible stakeholder management remains underdeveloped. In particular, CSR practices within the specific context of the pharmaceutical industry, a sector which particularly dramatically depicts the stakeholder management dilemmas faced by business managers, has been under-researched. To address this gap, this paper utilises qualitative, exploratory data, obtained via multiple research methods, to investigate the CSR practices of major pharmaceutical companies in the UK and Germany. The data are employed to critically re-examine and revise a previously published explanatory framework which identifies the management steps involved in CSR stakeholder engagement. The resulting revised explanatory framework is the main contribution of this paper. By abstracting those factors which influence CSR practice, it provides an analytical tool which is designed to be of practical use for business decision-makers when managing their stakeholder engagement activities. Given that the research addresses values and ideals and prescribes practical recommendations for practitioners, it is essentially applied and normative in nature. Ultimately, the framework proposes a set of steps for developing CSR strategies which could help CSR professionals to make a ‘mindset transition’ from a narrower ‘traditional’ approach to CSR to a more innovative way of thinking. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Conceptual frameworks; CSR; Pharmaceutical industry; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder management; UK and Germany",,"O’Riordan, L.; FOM Hochschule für Oekonomie & Management, University of Applied Sciences, Leimkugelstraße 6, Germany",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

The final sample consists of 27 managers from a mix of industries. Findings - The study shows that stakeholder's salience may have an impact on CCI activities, especially in the area of measurements and reporting activities. Moreover, while some companies have attempted to measure the social impact of their initiatives, a large number of companies have not. This is all the more surprising given the recent focus in marketing on accountability and measurement. The results show three challenges: lack of interest, lack of resources and lack of consensus.

Design/methodology/approach – The data were collected from 156 SSE owners/managers using snowball sampling method, operating in three industrial estates namely: Bari Brahmana, Gangyal and Digiana, Jammu, North India. Findings – The three-step procedure based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA), item/reliability analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were undertaken to establish the multidimensionality of BSR scale. The empirical results identify five BSR dimensions in SSEs – local community, employees, environment, suppliers and customers. Research limitations/implications – The major limitation of the study relates with data collection from only owners’/managers’ perspective, which might have resulted in biased perceptions. Practical implications – This study has direct practical implications for owners’ actions in relation to establishing BSR culture and orientation in SSEs. Besides, SSE owners/managers can also be benefited from the study’s findings through their increased awareness on the activities that contribute to corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities.

CSP data are a composite of two Taiwan’s CSP ratings, and CFP data are retrieved from Taiwan Economic Journal database. Two control variables, R&D investment (R&D) and industry type (IND), are included in our models.

Furthermore, our study reveals that the CSP in the non-manufacturing sector is more highly related with CFP than the case in the manufacturing sector in Taiwan.Originality/value: First, Our findings are consistent with the majority of recent research and are supported by the stakeholder theory. The paper argues that Taiwan firms should incorporate CSP into their business strategies for improving their competitive advantages. Second, our findings argue that Taiwan firms in the manufacturing sector should learn the best CSP practices from firms in the non-manufacturing sector to maintain and enhance their sustainability.

Thus, the number of geographical areas is not an important issue, but the degree of cultural international diversification between these areas what really influences firms' corporate social performance.

The development of the private sector in Lithuania relied on the principles of free market, rather than on the principles of social market. This sets additional tasks in pursuance of a broader practical development of corporate social responsibility, which is significantly influenced by scientific insights and research. To achieve the aim, the aspects of theoretical research on corporate social responsibility in the Lithuanian studies on the topic are discussed with the purpose to form guidelines for broader future research. Assessing empirical research in private and public sector organisations in Lithuania, focused on social responsibility, the threats posed by the lack of integral development of social responsibility are distinguished. It is stated that the scientific thought in this case should become the coordinating factor for a wider three-party social-organisation-individual discussion; therefore, theoretical and empirical studies should focus on this relationship, with the view of axiological congruence as the point of contact, which could accelerate social responsibility innovations. When carrying out empirical research in Lithuania, private and public capital should be methodologically distinguished, since the latter provides the obligation to serve the public interest, which is a conceptual opposite to profit maximisation. Based on these positions, it would be meaningful to assess in further studies how the earnings of the public sector managed enterprises are generated and used in the context of social responsibility. © 2014, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

It takes the form of an in-depth case study of a Swedish mining and metals company and employs an analytical framework based on the ISO 26000 CSR standard. The company in question has wellintegrated and implemented work systems regarding both labor practices and the environment. This indicates that certified management systems are effective tools for CSR and can be used rather effectively as a means of stakeholder management in practice. However, analysis also shows that such management systems contribute neither to the use of more renewable energy resources nor to a systematic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

In this paper, we focus on the individual level of CSP, manifested in the managerial discretion of a firm's principles, processes, and policies regarding social responsibilities. Specifically, we address the human resources management of employees as a way of promoting CSR values and producing socially minded outcomes. We show that applying the humanist philosophy to the managerial discretion of a business organization leads to the creation of an ""autonomy supportive work environment""-as defined by the self-determination theory-which in turn, facilitates the internalization of social values, citizenship behaviors, and cooperation. The objective of promoting self-determination at work (i.e., the core of a humanist management) fits well with the ontology of social responsibility since autonomy and consideration of individuals as moral actors are central tenets. Furthermore, we show that applying humanistic management philosophy to the discretion of managers can lead to socially responsible outcomes. First, intra-organizational stakeholders (e.g., employees) are treated with respect and focus is put on their well-being, satisfaction, and self-actualization at work. Second, as employees' need of self-determination is addressed by managers, it is likely that pro-social behaviors toward other stakeholders of the organization will be adopted, leading to socially responsible outcomes for extra-organizational stakeholders (Gagné, Motiv Emot 77:58-75, 2003). Thus, this paper ultimately posits that humanistic management applied to the HRM can be a solution for developing and maintaining socially responsible outcomes as determined at the individual level of the CSP model, through managerial discretion. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; HRM; Humanist philosophy; Managerial discretion; Self-determination",,"Wasieleski, D.

We provide evidence that both better stakeholder engagement and transparency around CSR performance are important in reducing capital constraints. The results are further confirmed using several alternative measures of capital constraints, a paired analysis based on a ratings shock to CSR performance, an instrumental variables approach, and a simultaneous equations approach.

Research shows that very few corporations have the organizational capacity to practice corporate citizenship. Evidence exists that ever more corporations adopt programs of corporate citizenship development to increase this capacity. However, there still is a general lack of a strategicunderstanding of how corporate citizenship development occurs. The potential of OD frameworks and tools for developing corporate citizenship have been highlighted. Nevertheless, how OD practitioners develop corporate citizenship has not been studied empirically so far. Design/methodology/approach – A sociomaterial case study design was used. The work of six OD practitioners when developing corporate citizenship in one of the largest pharmaceutical corporations was studied over several months, based on interviews, observations and document analyses. Findings – The findings presented offer model practices of corporate citizenship development, in the form of five core strategies and five core behaviors that increase an organization’s capacity to practice corporate citizenship. Research limitations/implications – With this study, the notion of corporate citizenship development has become established as a distinct research area. The study might encourage further research in this important niche area. Practical implications – The findings have direct practical implications for at least seven different stakeholder groups. Originality/value – The findings shed new light on both the epistemological and practical foundations of the concept of corporate citizenship, and hint to a new role of the fields of OD and human resource development in the twenty-first century. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Corporate citizenship; Corporate citizenship development; Corporate social responsibility; Human resource development; Organization development",,"Stolz, I.; Stolz ConsultingSwitzerland",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20469012,,,,"English","Eur.

While considerable research has been conducted on CSR in developed countries, the extant literature on CSR in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is scant and CSR is seen in terms of philanthropy. This paper aims to examine CSR from a broader perspective and in particular to identify the factors that hinder and promote CSR activities in SSA using the Smit (2009) CSR Value Chain Model. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on data obtained from a survey conducted by GTZ (now GIZ) on factors promoting and hindering CSR in SSA. The study surveyed 85 companies from six countries, namely; South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Namibia. The study essentially examined the internal and external CSR environments of the companies in the participating countries. Findings – The study revealed that there are nine key promoting and hindering factors of CSR for businesses in SSA. These include: leadership and governance, policy framework, project management, monitoring, evaluation and reporting, stakeholder engagement, staff engagement, government, funding and beneficiation. The study recommends a systemic and context-sensitive approach that relies on the potential of organisations and communities to design and implement their own solution within global frameworks in order to further develop CSR in the region. Research limitations/implications – There are a number of limitations in this study. First, this study did not include any informants from the responding organisations’ stakeholder groups, but relied mainly on information obtained from single respondents from organisations. Further research should include responses from other stakeholder groups. Practical implications – To promote or achieve the successful implementation of CSR and broaden its scope within the region beyond its current focus on philanthropy, managers must build bridges with their stakeholders through both formal and informal dialogues and engagement practices. Additionally, firms may enhance and maximise both social and economic value created when managers link their CSR activities to areas that improve firms’ long-term competitive potential by collectively and systematically applying their distinctive strengths to such activities in accordance with the value chain model. Originality/value – The finding in this study is novel and adds an important contribution to the developing CSR literature in the SSA region. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR hindering factors; CSR supporting factors; Philanthropy; Sub-Sahara Africa",,"Nyuur, R.B.-B.-I.; Newcastle Business School, Northumbria UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20400705,,,,"English","Afr.

By analysing political and sociological citizenship theories, we show that such engagement is more adequately explained by a change in the self-conception of corporate citizens from corporate bourgeois to corporate citoyens. While the corporate bourgeois acts primarily for private business purposes, the corporate citoyen engages in society, performing civil and political rights and duties. As an intermediate actor in society, shaped by the principle of subsidiary task-sharing, the corporate citoyen undertakes co-responsibility for social and civic affairs and actively collaborates with fellow citizens below, beside and beyond governmental regulation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bourgeois; Citoyen; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Responsibility; Social doctrine; Subsidiarity",,"Aßländer, M.

The more popular it became, the more it grew in complexity and the idea of corporate social irresponsibility arose.

This paper aims to integrate CSR into supply chain coordination. A new revenue sharing contract embedding corporate social responsibility (RS-CSR) is proposed for coordinating a two-tier supply chain. The RS-CSR contract requires that the manufacturer invest in CSR and charge the retailer a wholesale price. After the retailer sells products, it will return a ratio of its revenue to the manufacturer. A mathematical model is proposed to determine the optimal CSR investment, the wholesale price, and the revenue sharing ratio such that channel coordination is achieved. Two different objectives of the supply chain are discussed: profit maximizing and CSR performance maximizing. Numerical examples show that the RS-CSR contract can simultaneously achieve the following objectives under proper parameter settings: (1) improve CSR performance; (2) improve total supply chain profits; (3) ensure that each partner in the supply chain can benefit from the contract. The RS-CSR contract can be designed to achieve different level of CSR performance, subject to corporate culture of the SC and how the SC expects its profits and CSR performance.

However, there has been scarce attention in academia and practice to CSR's influence on brand awareness. To shed light on this issue, this study uses stakeholder theory to provide insights into the effects that CSR reporting initiatives and effective communication have on a company's brand. Sixteen most renowned and well-known service companies of Spain were considered. Findings of the study demonstrate a positive association between holding the ISO 26,000 certification and a firm's brand awareness. Furthermore, it was shown that reported information being reviewed by organisms other than global reporting initiative organisation is positively associated with the company's brand awareness in the service sector.

In response, some leading companies have begun to publish integrated reporting, in the form of a document providing a coherent summary of this information, thus facilitating stakeholder engagement. This paper examines the validity of the hypotheses of the theories of agency and of signalling, and analyses the political costs and those borne by owners in voluntarily developing this new type of business document. More specifically, in order to determine their prevalence among the suggested reasons for these paradigms, we analyse the effect of industry concentration, together with other factors, in the development of integrated reporting. The analysis of a non-balanced sample of 1590 international companies for the years 2008-2010, in which a logistic regression methodology is applied to panel data, reveals the negative impact of industry concentration on the development of a more pluralist report, simultaneously taking into account stakeholders, sustainability and the long-term viewpoint, as well as questions of responsible investment, business ethics and transparency.

It presents an empirical analysis of the governance of sustainability in fifty large listed companies based on each company's disclosures in annual and sustainability reports. We find that significant progress is being made by large listed Australian companies towards integrating sustainability into core business operations. There is evidence of leadership structures being put in place to ensure that board and senior management are involved in sustainability strategy development and are then incentivised to monitor and ensure implementation of that strategy through financial rewards. There is evidence of a willingness to engage and communicate clearly the results of these strategies to interested stakeholders. Overall, there appears to be a developing acceptance amongst large corporations that efforts towards improved corporate sustainability are not only expected but are of value to the business. We suggest that this is evidence of a managerial shift away from an orthodox shareholder primacy understanding of the corporation towards a more enlightened shareholder value approach, often encompassing a stakeholder-orientated view of business strategy.

With the decline of the modern welfare state since the late 1970s, social activities of business firms are increasingly regarded as an important complement to or even as a substitute for welfare state policies by a part of the literature. However, and controversially, another stream of argumentation regards these activities as being aimed at advancing the reach of market forces. To fully grasp the ambiguous nature of the social activities of business, in this paper I provide an account of affirmative as well as of critical interpretations of these activities throughout the history of modern capitalism. On this basis, the power of critique to disentangle the diverse motivations that underlie the social engagement of business is highlighted as a condition for facilitating a role of business in society that balances economic and social considerations. © 2014 The Author.

Such gains jeopardize interests of both internal and external stakeholders as well as the environment especially in the developing world.

The results indicate that the employee emerges as the stakeholder group most strongly linked to CFP, followed by the consumer stakeholder. The natural environment and the community stakeholder group are minimally associated with CFP. General support is found for a CFP-CSP relationship at a given point in time, with some support found for CSP as a lead (independent) variable.

It sheds light on perspectives of how socially responsible business conduct is shaped by consultancies in a national business environment where such an essential aspect of organizational commitment and behavior exhibits comparatively little resonance among companies and is primarily induced by supranational and international policy schemes as well as foreign competitors. Drawing from long interviews with consulting professionals, we explore key topics: the domestic CSR (consulting) industry's characteristics, issues pertaining to the engagement with clients, the endorsement of CSR standards and initiatives, along with the consultants' perspective on institutional dynamics and their prospects with respect to the future of CSR in Greece. In this context, we aim to indicate trends on CSR implementation, pressures exerted on consultants, and managerial attitudes towards corporate responsibility. Our findings illustrate an oligopolistically structured market that encourages consultancies to compete intensely, the consultants' limited capacity to influence the business behavior of their clients, with the latter to adopt a promotional communicative approach to CSR, as well as a lack of institutional coordination and mechanisms that will materially embed social responsibility in the strategic management of business. © 2014 The Authors.

As a response to the growing awareness of and concern about social and environmental issues, an increasing number of companies are proactively publishing their CSR-related principles and activities. The overall research question of this study is derived from legitimacy theory and is aimed at elucidating the relationship between industry sector and CSR communication. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical examination encompasses a sample that includes the annual reports of all German DAX-30 companies from 1998 to 2009. First, based on a content analysis, categories of CSR-related communication are defined. Second, these categories are used in a quantitative analysis with a longitudinal perspective to evaluate the hypothesis that companies in controversial industries communicate their CSR more intensely than companies in non-controversial industries. Findings: The qualitative study leads to a category system that accounts not only for CSR-related activities but also for CSR philosophies and motives as the normative basis of CSR communication. The quantitative results support the hypothesis that companies in controversial industries are more active in CSR communication than companies in non-controversial industries. Originality/value: Existing studies analysing CSR communication activity have been largely inconsistent and often use unsystematic approaches in choosing industries for comparison. Therefore, in this study, to overcome some of these deficiencies, a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches addresses the concept of controversial industries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Annual reports; Content analysis; Controversial industries; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental reporting",,"Kilian, T.; Institute of Media and Service Management, University of Koblenz-Landau, Koblenz, Germany; email: kilian@uni-koblenz.de",,,0955534X,,,,"English","Eur.

The current paper examines: how Nigerian companies incorporated CSR into their financial accounts; the correlation between an organisation's earnings and CSR reported; and the relationship between CSR reported and firm size. Using ANOVA and Pearson product-moment correlation to test the three hypotheses postulated, the central issues that emerged were that: the recognition, manner and style of CSR in annual financial reports were not standardised in Nigeria, not withstanding stakeholders' keen interest in such disclosures; it appeared there was a significant relationship between CSR reported and a firm's earnings and capital level. This study concluded that CSR disclosures were a key concept that had gained increasing international recognition and acceptance given its crucial role in the activities of an organisation and importance to a variety of stakeholders. Consequently, relevant legal authorities, standard setting bodies and other regulators in Nigeria should expedite action on standards and guidelines on CSR reporting. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR; CSR reporting; Financial statements; Firm earnings; Firm size; Nigeria; Strategic implications",,"Kuye, O.L.; Department of Business Administration, University of Lagos, Akoka-Yaba, Lagos State, Nigeria; email: labikuye@yahoo.com",,"Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",17533627,,,,"English","Int.

Students are perceived as future managers of the corporate world and their perception about CSR is deemed important to business organisations. The students can make companies understand their responsibility towards various stakeholders. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: By doing a review of past literature, an appropriate scale consisting of forty-one items has been developed to measure the dimensions of CSR. Data were collected from 294 students of various business schools situated in Rajasthan (India). The data collected was subjected to exploratory factor analysis to extract the main dimensions that would bring out the attitudes of the students towards CSR. Findings: Results revealed that the companies should pay attention to accountability towards stakeholders, corporate governance, ethical commitment and humanitarian concerns besides fulfilling other responsibilities as covered under the eight factors identified in the study. Research limitations/implications: This paper used survey data from small sample of management students in a limited geographic area. Hence, it might be difficult to generalize the results to a larger, more representative population. The research also suggests how corporations can make CSR an integral part of the business organisation. Practical implications: The dimensions identified in the study if incorporated by the business in its day-to-day operations can make it socially responsible as well as socially acceptable in the true sense. Originality/value: This research makes an empirical contribution to identify the factors which management students expect business enterprises should do to be justified as socially responsible corporate citizens. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Environment protection; Ethics; Social accountability",,"Jain, P.; Mody Institute of Technology and Science, Lakshmangarh, India; email: jainpriyanka5@yahoo.co.in",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1754243X,,,,"English","Int.

Excluding the majority of employees from the numerous developmental benefits and privileges of HiPo programs runs contrary to the ideals of corporate social responsibility (CSR), an increasingly common espoused value of organizations. This paper discusses the inadvertent hypocrisy of organizations seeking to demonstrate CSR actions for their employees while simultaneously barring the vast majority of employees access to targeted development opportunities. While many organizations are proud of developing exemplary TM systems and executing effective CSR initiatives, further analysis suggests an inherent incompatibility between these approaches as commonly practiced. This paper concludes with a discussion of possible solutions to ameliorate the disconnect between exclusionary TM practices and CSR outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Through the theoretical lens of organizational justice, the paper critically reviews relevant research on the impact of TM policies and practices on CSR initiatives. To spur further interest from scholars and practitioners, the paper offers responses to the following questions: What is the usual array of TM practices? What is the organization's social responsibility to its workforce at large and to individual employees? With resources devoted to developing HiPo talent, what is the organization's social responsibility to those in the ranks who have not been identified as HiPo? Findings: The critical review revealed that organizations seeking to simultaneously pursue TM best practices and CSR initiatives must tackle several fundamental issues, including expanding employee access to HiPo programs, enhancing the HiPo selection processes via greater emphasis on lead indicators of HiPo, and improving rater reliability across assessment tools. The paper concludes with practical suggestions to ameliorate the unintended consequences of disparate treatment of employees by creating a permeable boundary for broader employee inclusion in HiPo programs. Originality/value: The literature is remarkably deficient in research addressing the effects of TM practices on employees who are excluded from leadership development opportunities, and the resulting implications for CSR outcomes. Given the rapidly growing importance of CSR initiatives for many organizations, research on the impact of TM policies and practices is sorely needed. This paper addresses an important gap in the research literature on the unintended consequences of disparate treatment of employees and offers practical suggestions for more inclusive leadership development systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; High potential; Leadership development; Organizational justice; Talent management",,"Lacey, K.; Graziadio School of Business and Management, Pepperdine University, Los Angeles, CA, United States; email: kevin.groves@pepperdine.edu",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02621711,,,,"English","J.

Furthermore, the increase in awareness on environmental issues, sustainable development, corporate citizenship and the benefit of recycling had also placed more pressure on firms to adopt sustainable business initiatives such as a better reverse logistics strategy. Manufacturing firms however often focused on forward logistics and as a result, they tend to overlook at the importance of reverse logistics activities and its potential of improving the firm's performance. The objective of this study is to look at the current level of reverse logistics adoption among manufacturers in Malaysia and to identify the influence of customer/stakeholder pressure, regulatory pressure, financial and competitive pressure, and corporate citizenship pressure on the level of reverse logistics adoption. In addition, this study also aims to determine the relationship between reverse logistics adoption level and firm's performance. Data was collected through survey questionnaire, and the respondents consist of managers at manufacturing firms located in the Northern State of Malaysia and the Klang Valley. 101 samples were collected and data analysis was conducted using the Partial Least Square (PLS) regression analysis, through SmartPLS 2.0 software. Findings indicate that the level of reverse logistics adoption among Malaysia manufacturers is considerably low. Out of four independent variables, only the regulatory pressure has a significantly strong influence on the level of reverse logistics adoption, while customer and stakeholder pressure has a significant but moderate influence.

It aims to analyse the community impact of two Indian five-star hotels operating in Goa, a tiny coastal state. Design/methodology/approach - The study applies a case study method to examine the employment and environmental practices of the Vivanta by Taj and Leela Kempinski. Qualitative research methods were used, including interviews with management, community leaders, and workers. Secondary data were gathered from company web sites and promotion materials as well as applications under the national Right to Information Act to access official records in the pertinent government bodies. Findings - An analysis of the findings shows that CSR in India's tourism industry is currently limited to corporate self-reporting on indicators of the companies' choice or, in some cases, the minimum required by regulatory bodies. In the absence of tight regulatory oversight and pressure from local civil society, company reports present a one-way channel of communication of the companies' perception and practice of CSR. The paper concludes that the industry has yet to move beyond traditional philanthropy to embrace contemporary principles of CSR which include corporate transparency, multi-stakeholder engagement, and community empowerment. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the limits of CSR in an analysis of the actual practice, rather than just communication of CSR. By examining two Indian hotels' CSR practices from the perspective of external stakeholders, the paper contributes empirical data that highlights the role of CSR beyond the interests of the corporation in its relevance to the community.

This study thus specifically looks at India, through the 'unique', chronological and time-line (longitudinal) case of Bhopal, to elucidate our concept of CHRR. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Bhopal case; Business guidelines; CHRR; Corporate human rights responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; CSR; Good corporate governance; India",,"Bachmann, S.-D.; Executive Business Centre EB405, Bournemouth University, 89 Holdenhurst Road, Bournemouth, BH8 8EB, United Kingdom; email: sbachmann@bournemouth.ac.uk",,"Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",14779048,,,,"English","Int.

Sustainability concerns are concurrently becoming significant to business planning around corporate social responsibility and integral to organizational strategies toward enhancing shareholder value. The mindset of corporate managers is a key factor in determining company approaches to sustainability. But what do corporate managers understand by sustainability? Our study explores discursive meaning negotiation surrounding the concepts of environment and sustainability within business discourse. The study is based on qualitative interpretive research drawing from symbolic interactionism (Blumer, Symbolic interactionism: perspective and method. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1969) which postulates that meaning in discourse is an essentially contested domain dependent upon negotiation in the Habermasian tradition of mutually respectful dialogue (Habermas, The theory of communicative action: lifeworld and system: a critique of functionalist reason. Beacon Press, Boston 1987). Data from semi-structured intensive interviews of a small sample of senior corporate managers was analyzed to examine how corporate elites in India frame their approach to sustainability issues and respond to external pressures for deeper corporate responsibility. The findings point to the existence of a distinctively local narrative with strong potential for the discursive negotiation of personal and collective understanding of ethical and socio-cultural values that may help internalize broader sustainability considerations into corporate decision-making processes. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Discourse; Environment; Sustainability; Sustainable development",,"Nambiar, P.; Department of Media, Music, Communication and Cultural Studies, Macquarie UniversityAustralia",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Theoretical discussion and empirical examples demonstrate that the role of stakeholder dialogue in implementing CSR strategy is crucial in many ways.

Findings: Results indicate general bidirectional causality between sustainable supply chain performance and companies’ margins and revenue. However, the link between firms’ profitability and sustainable supply chain performance is unidirectional. In addition, the recent financial crisis altered this link between the studied constructs.

Such relationship is underscored when firms engage in corporate social responsibility practices, at least, in the societal ambience in which they operate. Corporate social responsibility is a strategy that has been known to improve firms' reputations and stakeholders' satisfaction, and has now been mostly related to the enhancement of social benefits. There are social and economic factors that are individually related to corporate social responsibility, yet, it is their integration that propitiates the appropriate convergence with a firm's business growth. If organisations ensure effective convergence of corporate social responsibility actions with business strategies, they may achieve business growth whilst appealing to its and society's needs. Thus, in order to effectively create positive collateral effects on business and society, firms should converge corporate social responsibility strategies with business growth strategies.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses 575 responses of hotel frontline employees in the US, collected through a national online survey. Findings: Results show that hotel employees' perceptions of CSR activities encompass the host community, colleagues, and customers, beyond green practices. Moreover, their perceptions of CSR activities positively and significantly influence the level of organizational identification. Research limitations/implications: The results of this exploratory study should not be generalized to all frontline employees in the US hotel industry. Future studies should extend this study to examine potential relationships among other variables relevant to organizational identification, and in other hospitality industry contexts. Also, this study does not seek to question the merits of CSR per se, as it takes a managerial perspective to assist hoteliers' understanding of and decision-making on CSR.

It is a complex and controversial phenomenon that can best be addressed via systems theory and the sensemaking perspective. This paper proposes a way to link a dialectical systems perspective with communications that includes the sensemaking and dialogic collective approaches, which help to build systems of organised activities that aim to find solutions to complex problems from a holistic perspective. Companies are increasingly aware that if they wish to be successful actors in their business and societal relationships, the traditional sole focus on maximising profit is counterproductive, especially in terms of sustaining their value chains. A holistic approach to CSR and the value chain involves companies integrating their stakeholders along their value chains, especially at the downstream and upstream extremes (their customers and suppliers). This paper illustrates its theoretical perspectives with a case study of JYSK, a multinational company based in Denmark, which demonstrates how the company based its actual management of CSR on its willingness to learn from its own actions and from the actions of others. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Case study; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Dialectical systems thinking; Dialogue; Sensemaking; Supply chain",,"Golob, U.; Marketing Communication and Public Relations Department, University of Ljubljana, Kardeljeva pl. 5, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; email: ursa.golob@fdv.uni-lj.si",,"Springer New York LLC",1094429X,,,,"English","Syst.

Design/methodology/approach: A purposive sample of 28 respondents was selected from three communities within the region. In addition, 20 in-depth interviews took place with oil workers, community leaders and elders within the region. These interviews lasted for approximately an hour and were transcribed verbatim. Findings: Drawing on qualitative research methodology, it is proposed that socially responsible investment could promote and facilitate business and social cohesion between corporations and broader communities that impinge on the company, rather than simply viewing business practice exclusively from an economic or political point of view. Research limitations/implications: This study has examined a small range of companies from an interpretivist ethnographic position in the Niger Delta region using data collected from interviews and observations. Future research could take a more positivistic position and explore a wider range of companies using a variety of data collection methods. Practical implications: Understanding corporate social responsibility (CSR) tends to be contextually bound, and should be divorced from the mechanistic Western perspective prevailing in most extant literature. Despite this context-specific notion to CSR relevance, there is still an overwhelming dominance of the understanding of CSR from the Western perspective, so companies should more closely consider local issues when drawing up CSR policy guidelines in a non-Western environment. Originality/value: Forty-eight individuals in the Niger Delta region have been interviewed, and their opinions on CSR issues have been reported. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited,.","Corporate social responsibility; Environment; Interpretivist ethnographic research; Niger Delta; Stakeholders",,"Lancaster, G.; London School of CommerceUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Islam, Buddhism and Christianity have received wider attentions in the CSR literatures from philosophical and religious perspective. However, Vedanta is yet to be explored in the context of CSR. This chapter therefore is timely and fills the gap in the CSR literature. Design/methodology/approach In this chapter, the authors employ hermeneutics, a qualitative research methodology which involves the study, understanding and interpretation of religious texts of Vedanta particularly the 'dharma' and 'karma' in the context of CSR. Findings-In a nutshell, the Vedanta provides an inside-out approach to CSR, which is development of the individual leader's self-conscience. The leaders and the role they play in corporations are crucial in ensuring transparency, good conduct and governance towards the ultimate aim of achieving CSR. Originality/value-This chapter analyses the Vedantic perspectives on communication in establishing CSR objectives. It investigates the problems and prospects of Vedantic style of communicating CSR.

Results show that CSR has a significant effect on corporate reputation, and customer emotions (positive and negative) partially mediate the effects of CSR and corporate reputation on loyalty intentions and word-of-mouth.

We integrate institutional theory with research on corporate political strategy to develop a political dependence model that explains (a) how different types of dependency on the government lead firms to issue corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and (b) how the risk of governmental monitoring affects the extent to which CSR reports are symbolic or substantive. First, we examine how firm characteristics reflecting dependence on the government-including private versus state ownership, executives serving on political councils, political legacy, and financial resources-affect the likelihood of firms issuing CSR reports. Second, we focus on the symbolic nature of CSR reporting and how variance in the risk of government monitoring through channels such as bureaucratic embeddedness and regional government institutional development influences the extent to which CSR communications are symbolically decoupled from substantive CSR activities. Our database includes all CSR reports issued by the approximately 1,600 publicly listed Chinese firms between 2006 and 2009. Our hypotheses are generally supported. The political perspective we develop contributes to organizational theory by showing that (a) government signaling is an important mechanism of political influence, (b) different types of dependency on the government expose firms to different types of legitimacy pressure, and (c) firms face a decoupling risk that makes them more likely to enact substantive CSR actions in situations in which they are likely to be monitored. © 2014 INFORMS.","China; Corporate social responsibility; Emerging markets; Institutional theory; Nonmarket strategy; Political strategy",,"Harvard Business School, Boston, MA 02163, United States",,,10477039,,,,"English","Organ.

However, the psychosocial characteristics of CSR have remained relatively unexplored. Indeed, some scholars have recently proposed that both the perspective-taking (as a cognitive dimension of CSR) and propensity to take care (as an affective dimension of CSR) of different stakeholders are related to sustainable and socially responsible organizational behaviors (as the behavioral dimension of CSR), thus fostering the development of CSR within enterprises that take a multi-stakeholder approach. According to this psychosocial perspective, we propose and test a multidimensional Psychosocial CSR (P-CSR) scale to measure organizational engagement in corporate social responsibility with regard to multiple stakeholders. By linking the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of CSR to the propensity of business professionals to enhance their environmental and social ethics, we offer a more complete description of how CSR involving multiple stakeholders arises in enterprises. A survey of 345 business professionals-including both employers and employees-of Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) completed a self-reported questionnaire. Based on the psychosocial perspective, we found that multi-stakeholder-oriented perspective-taking, propensity to take care, and socially responsible behaviors are part of the same construct, leading to an exhaustive explanation of CSR at the organizational level.

Customers, partners and suppliers, competitors, and employees are the elements of the market environment. On the other hand, the non-market elements are everything that affects the market indirectly. Non-market strategy recognises that businesses are social and political beings, not just economic agents. A non-market strategy allows a company to shape the environment in which it operates, creating opportunities. Islamic Corporate Social Responsibility (ICSR) derives itself from core principles in the holy Qur’an. The three major foundational principles for ICSR are the vicegerency of mankind on earth, divine accountability and the duty on mankind to enjoin good and forbid evil. ICSR concept appears to be in close conformity with the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, but in many respects go further than the minimum standards adopted by this framework. MNCs should not underestimate the Middle Eastern region historical events of the Arab League boycott, the Danish cartoons and the ‘Arab Spring’ revolution.

Design/methodology/approach: A convenience sample of respondents in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, was collected. The final sample consisted of 254 surveys. Findings: The findings confirmed the applicability of Carroll's (1979) categorization of CSRs to consumers in Indonesia but challenged the order of importance of these responsibilities. In addition, the results clearly indicated that perceptions of legal and philanthropic responsibilities significantly explained consumers' support for responsible businesses. The results will assist managers operating in the developing countries, especially Indonesia.

Thus, this limits the generalizability of the findings.

Using a comprehensive CSR index covering ten dimensions, we analyse the CSR disclosures in a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries. The CSR disclosure index shows that Islamic banks engage across the range of social activities, both as individual banks and as countries. However Islamic banks seem to show more commitment to the vision and mission, the board and top management, and the financial product/services dimensions, whilst least attention is paid to the environment dimension. Islamic banks also show a considerable awareness of the mandatory disclosure recommendations of the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) however, they pay less attention to the voluntary CSR disclosure. Moreover, we find a pronounced emphasis in Islamic banks strategy towards more universal disclosures, suggesting the legitimacy of these banks is reinforced through disclosure to the wider stakeholder community. The empirical analysis highlights a positive association between CSR disclosure and financial performance. We also find a positive and highly significant association between the Shari'ah supervisory board (SSB) size and CSR disclosure index. Finally, the results of the three-stage least squares estimation show that the causality between the two endogenous variables runs from financial performance to CSR disclosure. Thus CSR disclosure is determined by financial performance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Islamic banks; Shari'ah supervisory board; Social reporting",,"Mallin, C.; Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom; email: c.mallin@uea.ac.uk",,"Elsevier",01672681,,JEBOD,,"English","J.

Recent findings suggest that management teams experience an increased interest and demand for CSR information from the actors on the stock market and that this underlie a focus shift. This is quite astonishing considering that the interest from just stock market actors in CSR information always has been meagre. However, due to lack of recent studies, it has not been confirmed that de facto there has been a trend shift among stock market actors towards an increased interest in CSR information.Design/methodology/approach - The data are derived from in-depth semi-structured interviews with financial analysts at international investment banks.Findings - The study confirms that the focus shift is not at all driven by the actors in the stock market. Quite the opposite. They express mistrust towards this information and a continued meagre interest in it.Research limitations/implications - Findings from the study suggest the need for more research on how different stakeholders view CSR information. It also opens up for discussions on regulations concerning CSR information.Practical implications - The findings imply that management teams might have deluded themselves and become victim to what Christensen and Cheney (2000) refer to as self-seduces, i.e. seeing things that are not really there. The findings might also indicate an enlargement of the stakeholder perspective. Thus, a subtle shift from a bilateral relationship (company - shareholders) towards a multilateral set of relationships (company - stakeholders) camouflaged under the justification from management teams that the increased interest comes from the stock market.Originality/value - The study contributes to the scarce research on how actors in the stock market view CSR.

In the corporate social responsibility (CSR) area, however, researchers have utilized theories that take into account only one or the other - institutional theory, which explains CSR as legitimacy-seeking activities in line with national-level institutions, or economic-based approaches that consider CSR effects only in terms of firm profitability. While an institutional argument implies convergence in CSR behavior among firms in similar institutional contexts, profit maximization logic treats CSR as a firm-specific behavior. We integrate these perspectives by demonstrating the moderating effects of firms' economic motivations for seeking legitimacy on the relationship between institutional environment and CSR responsiveness. We argue that variations in firms' economic visibility and economic vulnerability can bring about differences in their need for societal goodwill, and in turn, their legitimacy seeking. Findings on a database of apparel firms' employee-related CSR across 23 countries support this overall argument. The integration of such fundamentally different theoretical perspectives allows us to contribute new theoretical insights to international business on the influence of national institutions on firms' behavior. © 2014 Academy of International Business.","apparel; corporate social responsibility; hierarchical linear modeling; institutional environment; institutional theory; labor practices; multilevel analysis; national culture; profit maximization",,"Makhija, M.V.; Management and Human Resources, Fisher College of Business, Ohio State University, 724 Fisher Hall, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, United States",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",00472506,,,,"English","J.

In one of the most important developments in this area, in 2001 when the Commission of the European Communities brought the Green Paper for Promoting a European framework for Corporate Social Responsibility, the main definitions about CSR and external and internal dimension have been explained. Inside the internal dimension human resource management (HRM) was emphasized as an area which is primarily included in the CSR practices. Since employees and managers are usually seen as very important factors of successful CSR implantation, in this paper the relations between these two concepts are analyzed.Based on the above mentioned, the aim of this study was to explore the existence of CSR in organizations from the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region and the relationship between CSR and HRM. The analysis was done trough the exploration of the differences between organizations that have or not CSR statements in relation to the level of environmental matters and existence of the HRM action plans. Subjects of the research are the concepts of CSR and HRM, as well as the empirical analysis of data from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and Serbia related to the implementation of CSR in organizations. Based on data obtained in the Cranet research project from 2008 to 2010, it has been explored whether companies from CEE and Serbia have statements on social responsibility, or doing business based on some unwritten standards, and if there is a connection between these statements, the level of environmental matters and HRM practices in the organizations. Statistical techniques as descriptive statistics, crosstabs, chi-square tests and ANOVA test were used in SPSS Version 17.0. Based on the literature review on CSR and HRM, as well as on data analysis the authors attempted to explain the connection between these management concepts. © 2014 Kaunas University of Technology.

Design/methodology/approach: Through an extensive study of literature review, the related items of these core subjects were identified. Data for the study were collected from 207 Iranian manufacturing and service firms. The research model was tested using structural equation modeling. Findings: Statistical analysis revealed that a number of significant relationships between CSR practices and organizational performance of Iranian organizations. The result found that community involvement and development plays an important role in enhancing organizational performance of organizations. Research limitations/implications: First, the time sequence of the association between the variables could not be concluded, given that cross-sectional data were used.

After pointing out a number of benefits and limitations in the effectiveness of CSR standards, both from a theoretical point of view and in the light of empirical evidence, we formulate and discuss a Paradox of CSR standards: despite being well-intended, CSR standards can favor the emergence of a thoughtless, blind and blinkered mindset which is counterproductive of their aim of enhancing the social responsibility of the organization. We analyze three problems that might underlie the Paradox—namely the problem of deceptive measurements; the problem of responsibility erosion and the problem of blinkered culture.

However, these studies demonstrate conflicting results on how CSR influences consumer purchasing behavior and retention; for example, in event of negative information about a firm. Therefore, the effectiveness of CSR in advancing the core business of firms remains unresolved. This research uses a qualitative approach to examine how CSR affords firms greater levels of goodwill with consumers. The study focuses on the case of Apple in China. Both primary and secondary data were collected through interviews, review of literature, newspaper reports, blogs, social media, and official websites of institutions and corporate entities. A deductive analytical approach was used to examine how consumers perceive CSR, and how that impacts on their attitude towards a firm when confronted with negative information. The study found low level of awareness of CSR in consumers. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that consumers tend to attach more importance to CSR when they identify with the problems associated with the actions or inactions of a firm. The study shows that firms can only enjoy the full benefits of CSR by creating public awareness of such endeavours. © 2014, Virtus Interpress.

Among the 30 comparisons of disclosure patterns, 29 show no difference. We also provide examples of specific disclosures that show a remarkable level of similarity in CSRR and in the CSRR management structures adopted in the two countries. Our findings show similar overall patterns of CSRR in diverse settings, while differences in CSRR content at a more detailed level remain. For example, companies refer to the applicable national regulations and rules; as well as to their specific local communities. These findings provide evidence that the same reporting templates are used in CSRR globally. There is evidence to suggest that CSRR is institutionalised through professionalization and other means, suggesting a need to interpret CSRR characteristics and patterns as a reflection of global CSRR templates.

Although mining industries have many advantages, inappropriate mining activities have led to dramatic environment and resource depletion. To achieve a balance of such activities, sustainable practices are a must and should be followed by the industry. Of the various sustainable practices, CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) has gained prominence recently. In developed countries, CSR is at an advanced level, but in developing countries-especially in South Asia-CSR is in a preliminary stage, due to both known and unknown reasons. This paper investigates drivers for CSR implementation in the mining industry in India, a developing nation in South Asia. Some studies focused on CSR issues but were limited to industrial perspectives without considering multi-stakeholders. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by analysing CSR drivers from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including governmental, media, and societal associations. We propose a model framework, illustrated with a case study from an industrial unit in India, through Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy DEMATEL). Based on these findings, industries can increase their chances of practicing value-added CSR in industrial environments.

The political ecologies of mining remain characterized by increasing demands for more democratic decision-making as occurred in the 1990s. In order to explain this continuity, most studies focus on the interactions between States and civil societies. They state that a pragmatic stance on resource governance regards rent capture and distribution over the development of mechanisms for inclusion in decision-making. These assessments give only a partial account of the interactions involved in such dynamic, they underestimate corporate behavior as a central component of emerging forms of governance. We argue that companies were central actors of the production of mining conflicts during the 1990s and still exert an important degree of influence in resource governance through corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies. Our findings show that since the neoliberal legal and administrative reforms of the early 1990s, Argentinian and Ecuadorian governments have supported a system of mining governance that regards the economic interests over the demands for more democratic decision-making. Nevertheless, even after recognizing the deleterious effects of neoliberal CSR practiced by companies, left-of-center governments have not been able to steer corporate behavior in a new direction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The motivation to structure this framework derives from contemporary market-based mechanisms of emissions trading (or carbon/credits/offsets) and renewable energy credits (RECs). However, the framework proposed herein moves beyond existing forms of credits trading mechanisms that are primarily focused on reducing the environmental footprint of the ongoing industrial/non-industrial activities. By adopting a comprehensive perspective, the paper emphasises simultaneously social sustainability-related considerations and CSR related activities based on the sale of CSR credits or certificates which bears striking resemblance to the sale of renewable energy credits (RECs) for subsidising the production of renewable energy. This is in direct contrast to emissions trading mechanism in which carbon credits/offsets are purchased by parties who desire to release a corresponding quantity of emissions above the permitted cap. Furthermore, the paper discusses the feasibility of the proposed CSR credits trading mechanism from a broader context of the ongoing climate change crises, political economy and geopolitical circumstances which are known drivers for determining the success of CSR activities by corporation(s) in domestic or overseas locations.

These clusters coincide with the business units (BUs) and markets of the organization under investigation. By employing a framework of CSRO, the study reveals substantial differences across clusters within one single internationally operating organization. The English-speaking and the South Asia clusters were found to be most concerned with legal regulations and economic performance. In contrast, the West Europe continental cluster was found to be more concerned about business conforming to ethical norms than achieving high levels of economic performance or conforming to legal regulations. Furthermore, the study reveals gender differences in CSRO and differences among random employees and employees who are professionally active in the area of CSR.

In addition, regression models are utilized to analyze the behavior of CSR reporting of a sample of 5,334 listed firms in China.Findings - Our paper records a significant increase of CSR reporting in the period of 2008-2010. Using a sample of 5,334 listed firms in China, we find a positive yet weak association between centrally controlled state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and CSR reports. Moreover, we find that firms with more concentrated block ownership are less likely to issue CSR reports.Research limitations/implications - Taken as a whole, our analyses suggest that the entrenchment effect from blockholders seems to dominate the incentive effect and this depresses the quality of CSR reports.Practical implications - Despite the well-known effect of economic factors on CSR decision, corporate governance such as ownership structure could complicate the final results. Furthermore, the institutional background of the country and its implications for corporate governance should be considered jointly and concurrently.Social implications - The positive effect from regulatory pressure on centrally owned SOEs suggests that regulation remains an effective tool to encourage CSR reporting in emerging markets.Originality/value - First, our study confirms prior research that CSR disclosure decision is primarily driven by economic and strategic considerations. Moreover, our results suggest that a country's institutional background, in addition to economic and strategic considerations, influences the decision and quality of CSR disclosures. Second, we extend the literature on ownership structure, particularly with respect to blockholders. Third, our research design addresses a weakness in earlier studies which are biased exclusively on state ownership to the exclusion of all other blockholders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Blockholders; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility reporting; Non-financial reporting; Ownership structure; State-Owned Enterprises",,"Zheng, L.; Stetson School of Business and Economics, Mercer UniversityUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

Specifically, this study examines the impact of two aspects of an organisation's socially responsible behaviours, i.e. employees' perceptions of CSR initiatives directed at internal and external stakeholders, on employees' job satisfaction. The findings indicate that perceived CSR relates positively to job satisfaction through its effects on overall justice perceptions and organisational identification.

Results show that employees' CSR judgments trigger their affective commitment and performance on extra-role CSR-specific behaviors; however, extra-role CSR-specific performance is unrelated to in-role job performance. Study 2 replicates Study 1's findings while, in addition, applies a social information processing approach and offers novel insights by demonstrating the cascading effects of managers' CSR judgments on employee CSR judgments. Investments made in CSR programs in order to improve employee judgments and behaviors may be unsuccessful if employees' CSR judgments are based on social information that remains unchanged.

An entirely ""end-user focused"" and ""solely profit-maximization"" perspective of conducting business may not be conducive for corporate brands in today's global economy, where consumers are environmentally and socially conscious. The concepts of, and relationship between, core brand values (CBV) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) are discussed. We proposed that compatibility between CSR and CBV-which satisfies multiple stakeholders without sacrificing financial viability of an organization-can promote an organization's corporate brand equity (CBE). We presented two propositions relating CBV and CSR and provided illustrations of companies where CSR activities are congruent with CBV. The unique contribution of this paper is the novel suggestion of enhancing CBE through compatibility between CBV and CSR.","Brand equity; Core brand values; Corporate branding; Corporate social responsibility",,,,"Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Congruently, firm interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives has also increased. Signaling theory suggests that firms may be increasing their CSR strategies in an effort to signal their willingness to operate within social mores. However, firms are faced with the problem of how to communicate their social commitment objectively to stakeholders. We argue that firms are forming CSR alliances in an attempt to signal an objective message to stakeholders concerning their commitment to CSR. To provide insight into these explanations, we compare the Total CSR performance (TCSR) scores of firms that form CSR alliances with those firms that do not. We control for firm size, leverage, profitability, and industry. We find that firms that form CSR alliances generally have higher TCSR scores, which suggests that one of the reasons that firms form these alliances is to publicize their stronger social and environmental records to stakeholders.

It is postulated that the degree of commitment and implementation varies with the different stages of the mine life cycle. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology/approach applied in this paper follows that of complex systems theory. The authors recognize that elements of CSR do not function/occur in isolation but rather operate in a complex and dynamic system. Findings: The findings presented in the paper indicate that there is a not a single ""silver bullet"" approach to CSR but rather one that ebbs and flows with not only the technical stage of development of a mine but also those extra- economic modifiers that influence a mine's performance and survivability in a competitive global market. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this particular paper/research is the inability to get a complete set of cost data from any single mining operation. This is due to the highly confidential and proprietary nature of this data, hence a hypothetical/theoretical case is presented. Practical implications: The practical implications of this research include recognizing the different stages of the mine life cycle cause different applications of CSR policy development and implementation.

Communication studies alert us to (1) how meaning is constructed through communication, something that has implications for the management of organizations as publics hold different views of CSR and expect different things from them; (2) how a dialogue between an organization and its publics should unfold; (3) how practices of transparency can assist organizations to come across as trustworthy actors; and, importantly, (4) how a complexity view is fruitful to grasp the CSR communication process.

They also examine the role of the status quo effect on CSR actions in tourist destinations. The status quo effect occurs because people generally place much more value on avoiding a loss than on acquiring a gain. Visitors to Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) were presented with alternative profiles of CSR measures and were given one of two treatments that varied according to the definition of the status quo alternative and the valuation question. The design of the experiments enabled the authors to compare the respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) a higher price for their holiday in a destination that has in place several CSR measures and willingness to accept (WTA) a lower price for the same destination with a lower CSR profile. The data are modelled using a flexible approach that allows for the consideration of alternative decision rules in the visitor's decision process. The results show that tourists care about CSR attributes and are likely to make their vacation choices on the basis of such attributes. Moreover, in this context the standard economic theory assumption of preferences symmetry is not satisfied. In other words, the cost of not implementing CSR actions is higher than the benefits of implementing them. When a destination increases CSR actions the number of visitors and their WTP for their visit are likely to increase, but at substantially lower rates than the WTP for alternative destinations (WTA) when the destination reduces its CSR actions. These results may explain why conventional studies find ambiguous effects of CSR action on tourist choice.","Corporate social responsibility; Discrete choice experiments; Heuristics; Status quo effect; WTA; WTP","corporate strategy; demand analysis; discrete choice analysis; heuristics; tourism; tourist destination; willingness to pay; Bolivar [Colombia]; Cartagena [Bolivar]; Colombia",,,"University of London",13548166,,,,"English","Tour.

Methodology/approach- This chapter draws upon the notion of dialectics discussed by scholars such as Hegel and Marx and infuses it with Bakhtinian notions of dialogism to create a dialectical framework for analyzing discourses of CSR.Findings-This chapter illustrates the conceptual argument for a dialectical approach to examining discourses of CSR by using the example of the dualistic discussion of corporations as agents of empowerment or exploitation. When examined through a dialectical lens, the empowerment exploitation debate reveals, among others, the dissolution of boundaries between the categories of empowerment and exploitation, the coexistence and interplay of a multitude of related oppositions, and raises questions on praxical patterns employed by social actors to manage the dialectical tensions inherent in everyday organizing. Social implications-A dialectical approach in communication studies could open possibilities for acknowledging the co-existence of and interplay among multiple voices in society, thus opening spaces for engaging with diverse perspectives and creating a more holistic understanding of complex social constructs such as CSR. Originality-A dialectical approach that attends to tensions negotiated by social and organizational actors as they try to conceptualize, enact, and communicate CSR can enrich the study of polyphonic discourses of CSR by generating more textured and insightful understandings of CSR than those currently examined through mostly dualistic lenses.

Design/methodology/approach - We analyse the single case of an acknowledged leader in CSR, Unilever. We undertake an interpretive textual analysis of how Unilever has accounted for its progress towards greater social and environmental responsibility in its annual social and environmental reports published between 2000 and 2012. Findings - We identify enduring themes as well as what has changed in this 12-year period. We conclude that while Unilever has made definite progress, becoming more confident and ambitious in its plans and achievements, it potentially runs the risk of reducing CSR to a 'tame problem' that can be solved through technical solutions that offer winwin solutions and do not challenge the economic theory of the firm. Research implications - We show the value of using the perspective of 'wicked problems' to understand the complexity of the CSR challenge facing the MNE. Practical implications - We suggest that the current approach of measuring CSR progress has limitations and potentially negative side effects. Originality/value - Our chapter offers a novel conceptualisation of CSR, as well as empirical evidence of CSR as a process of corporate sensemaking in the face of 'wicked problems'.

One way that quick-service firms attempt to set themselves apart is through genuine, long-term corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts, in addition to the quality of their food, service, and overall restaurant environment. This article explores the extent to which customers’ perceptions of Chick-fil-A’s food, service, environment, and CSR affect the three dimensions of their relationship quality with that firm—namely, satisfaction, trust, and identification, based on convenience survey of 483 of the firm’s customers. With regard to the elements of a customer relationship, the analysis found that (1) awareness of CSR programs did not improve customer satisfaction but did boost identification and trust, (2) service quality supported trust and satisfaction but does not influence customers’ identification with the firm, and (3) food quality affects customer satisfaction but has no connection with trust or identification with the firm. Finally, customer satisfaction and trust were related to customer loyalty, but identification with the company was not connected with loyalty. These findings suggest that increasing customer satisfaction levels (or any short-term goal) should not be the primary objective of CSR programs in the QSR industry. Instead, it appears that CSR initiatives should involve a genuine long-term effort to build customers’ trust and identification. © The Author(s) 2014.","Chick-fil-A; corporate social responsibility (CSR); fast food; identification; quick-service restaurants (QSRs); relationship quality; satisfaction; trust",,"Swimberghe, K.R.; The University of Texas at Tyler, 3900 University Blvd, United States",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",19389655,,,,"English","Cornell Hosp.

The most recent report, King III, views stakeholder relationship management as a key tenet of corporate governance. This raises the question whether public relations professionals (PRPs) understand the principles of corporate governance well-enough to inform and guide organizations on the management of stakeholder relationships. The views of senior PRPs at selected top performing companies were elicited on their practice of stakeholder relationship management in line with corporate governance principles. It was found that their knowledge on corporate governance was limited, although they recognized its importance. They propose six role functions for managing stakeholder relationships on a strategic or managerial level; these role functions are aligned with the King III principles on stakeholder relationships. The following three were of particular importance: developing a corporate strategy, giving advice to senior management and managing crisis communication. Different terminologies were used to build relations with stakeholders and different approaches were used to profile stakeholders. It is recommended that organizations leverage their public relations functions on strategic and managerial levels in support of their corporate governance efforts. In turn, PRPs are encouraged to ensure a deep knowledge on corporate governance issues when counseling senior management on building stakeholder relationships. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate governance; Governing stakeholder relationships (GSR); Public relations; Stakeholder engagement (SE); Stakeholder relationship management (SRM)",,"Meintjes, C.; Faculty of Management Sciences, Department of Marketing and Retail Management, Durban University of Technology, ML Sultan Campus Block B, 7th Floor, South Africa; email: cornem@dut.ac.za",,"Elsevier BV",03638111,,PRERE,,"English","Public Relat.

The underlying premises of this paradigm are not always in tune with the imperatives of the kind of corporate social responsibility agenda which businesses now face. This dissonance is rooted in an underlying denial of the need for an ethical approach to the management of the firm, which tends to leave corporate social responsibility as an 'add-on' activity. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that both economic and social responsibility objectives can be achieved through Buddhist economics or Buddhist economic informed management practice (BEIM). The theoretical argument is illustrated by a rich case study of a Thai firm. To follow that other way could and arguably should be to design operations in a way such that moral behaviour - in all matters - comes first; this will reveal corporate social responsibility as a core driver of the business in whatever cultural setting it may be found.

Design/methodology/approach: Using structural equations analysis, the paper examines survey data obtained from employees of a USA-based financial services firm to test hypotheses regarding employee's perceptions of corporate engagement in CSR and continuous process improvement, as well as their work attitudes. Findings: Employee perceptions of CSR and of CPIO are strongly related. Both CSR and CPIO have similar, but still unique effects upon organizational commitment (OC).

The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities on the antecedents of customer loyalty among customers in the airline industry.

Analyzing unprecedented survey data from investors in a socially responsible (SR) mutual fund, this article considers how economic and ethical concerns shape shareholder investment behavior. In particular, this article analyzes levels of investor fund loyalty, defined as the continued investment in a mutual fund despite the belief that one is earning a lower return on investment. Building upon existing research that shows SR fund assets are more stable than conventional fund assets, this article leverages within respondent comparisons to clarify that dual investors (i.e., those who invest in both SR and conventional funds) are more loyal to their SR fund than to their conventional fund. This suggests that a corporation's ethical behavior attracts more patient investment capital, an important consideration for any corporation that is deciding to what degree it should engage in corporate social responsibility. In addition, this article empirically demonstrates that economic motivations reduce SR fund loyalty and that ethical motivations induce SR fund loyalty. This evidence that ethical motivation is associated with fund loyalty advances research on morality in the market by yielding empirical evidence to a largely theoretical debate. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Customer loyalty; Ethical consumption; Socially responsible investing",,"Peifer, J.

This is particularly true for the case of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The purpose of the current study is to empirically test the relationship between CSR and CFP. We use data for 66 Chinese SOEs listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The results are interesting in that they are not consistent with similar studies using US and other Western market data. We find a significant negative relationship between CSR performance and CFP. The results are discussed in light of the preferential government treatment afforded to Chinese SOEs, and social welfare requirements imposed on such entities.

However, it is still unclear how employees perceive organizational CSR efforts and whether such perceptions bring employee satisfaction and loyalty. To answer these timely inquires, we developed and empirically tested a theoretical framework modeling employee satisfaction as both mediator and moderator on the relationship between employee perception of organizational CSR efforts and their loyalty to enterprises. Based on 438 usable questionnaires collected from four typical companies, we found that solely providing money-related welfare and improving the working environment can be detrimental to employee loyalty, but by increasing employee satisfaction of personal treatment, companies can mitigate such a side-effect.

In this paper, we present a mutually supporting analytical model and exploratory case to study the managerial and policy issues related to quality control in food supply chain management with a focus on the Chinese dairy industry. Based on a general supply-chain model with acceptance sampling tests under uncertain product quality, we show that, depending on the sampling technology, the decentralized supply-chain structure may lead to a distortion in product quality. We also explore the effects of different pricing and regulatory options of vertical control on product quality and the distribution of the total supply-chain profit. In addition, we use an exploratory case study of the 2008 adulterated milk incident in China to investigate practical issues in ensuring product quality/safety in food supply chain management. Our analytical results and two comparative cases show that, instead of the common ""poor quality"" misperception of food products from global emerging markets, it is actually the poor vertical control strategy for managing the food supply chain quality and risk that caused the adulterated milk incident.

A field experiment reveals that ephemerality moderates the positive impact of scarcity on consumers' perception of fit between luxury and CSR. When luxury products are enduring (e.g., jewelry), a scarce product is perceived as more socially responsible than a more widely available one and provokes positive attitudes. However, this effect does not appear for ephemeral luxury products (e.g., clothing). The perceived fit between luxury and CSR mediates the combined effects of scarcity and ephemerality on consumers' attitudes toward luxury products. This study provides valuable insights that luxury brand managers can use to design their CSR and marketing strategies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Consumers; Corporate social responsibility; Ephemerality; Luxury products; Scarcity",,"Lindgreen, A.; Cardiff Business School, University of Cardiff, Aberconway Building, Colum Drive, Cardiff, CF10 3EU, United Kingdom; email: LindgreenA@cardiff.ac.uk",,,01674544,,,,"English","J.

In this paper, we propose measuring CSP via the construct of stakeholder satisfaction through social media. Using organizational justice theory, we argue that the satisfaction of stakeholder expectations can be understood partly through the perception of unjust corporate behavior, which is then expressed by stakeholders through social media. The explosion of social networking and microblogging has made it possible for people to express opinions with respect to the economic, social, and environmental events for all sorts of firms. We test these ideas using event study methods with a sample of 5,440 observations from ten firms. We find preliminary evidence of the sensitivity of social media to these events.","Corporate social performance; Event study; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Stakeholder",,,,"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico",,,,,"Spanish","Contad.

However, mainstream HPWS research has paid little attention to employees' perceptions of HPWS, or to the relationship between HPWS and corporate social performance (CSP). The influence of CSP on employee outcomes such as organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) has thus been similarly neglected. This paper seeks to investigate these missing links in literature using data collected from a sample of 700 employees in China. The findings demonstrate that HPWS is positively related to HPWS satisfaction and employees' perceptions of CSP. HPWS satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between HPWS and employees' affective commitment (AC). There are multiple mediators between HPWS and OCB, indicating more complicated mechanisms through which HPWS leads to desired HR outcomes. Employees' perceived CSP has a significant influence on HPWS satisfaction, AC and OCB, suggesting firms should place a premium on achieving a reputation as being socially responsible. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","China; Corporate social performance; Employee outcomes; HPWS; HPWS satisfaction",,"Zhang, M.; Department of Management, La Trobe Business School, La Trobe University, Bundoora, 3086, Australia; email: m.zhang@latrobe.edu.au",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

The analysis shows that SD intensity is closely linked to the quality of social reports. Some categories, such as corporate identity, membership and community, exhibit high levels of disclosure whilst for other categories, like the environment, there is a lack of a coherent and unitary plan.

The attributes of sustainability and the mechanism of sustainability governance of the fast fashion supply chain are also discussed. From the perspective of strategic corporate social responsibility, we first analyze the motives for adopting sustainability governance in fast fashion supply chains, and identify seven competitive sustainable attributes of the fast fashion product based on sustainable development theory. Then, by establishing a sustainability governance framework, we identify seven factors that affect the sustainability governance decision-making and evaluate the efficiency and legitimacy mechanism of sustainability governance from internal and external perspectives. Finally, we explore the application of the governance mechanisms via a case study based on H&M's seven sustainability commitments. The findings suggest that the core influence and centrality of a corporation should be strengthened from the perspective of internal governance, and stakeholders should collaborate to achieve sustainability governance throughout the entire fast fashion supply chain from the perspective of external governance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Fast fashion; Supply chain governance; Sustainability",,"Li, Y.; China Academy of Corporate Governance, Business School, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China; email: liyongjian@nankai.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",02632373,,,,"English","Eur.

Although the two sets of activities are similar, they are also very different. Both CSC and CEC respond to issues raised by stakeholders, but CEC tends to be more ""technical"". This characteristic demands that CEC fit with the organization, which exposes greater economic opportunities than CSC. As a result, we argue that the extent to which these practices are implemented differs across firms over time. We analyze the extensiveness of implementation of CSC and CEC across 266 firms from 1991 to 2003, using latent growth curve modeling and one-way ANOVA. We find that firms moved towards at least a moderate level of CSC over time, but tended to bifurcate in the extent to which they implemented CEC practices, towards either the high or low end of the scale, over time. In this paper, we contribute to the institutional analysis of practice diffusion by examining how the characteristics of different kinds of practices shape the extensiveness of firm adoption patterns. As well, this research also speaks to corporate social responsibility researchers, pointing to the need to sometimes discriminate between social and environmental practices. © The Author(s) 2014.","corporate social responsibility; institutional theory; latent growth modeling; practice implementation",,"Bansal, P.; Ivey Business School, Western University, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; email: tbansal@ivey.uwo.ca",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",01708406,,,,"English","Organ.

However, the intangibility of this concept and the dispersion of related standards and regulations has created a context characterized by lack of homogeneity in the publishing of CSR results. The present study aims to determine the extent to which Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators are used by Spanish listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical analysis has been performed to asses and evaluate the 2011 CSR reports published by the companies listed on the IBEX-35, the Spanish stock exchange index which includes the most important listed companies. The analysis is centered exclusively on the economic indicators established by the GRI. The methodology used to interpret the results is based on the procedures of multivariate analysis, namely principal components analysis, correlation matrix, and hierarchical clustering. Findings: The results of the study show that although the GRI tool is used extensively within the IBEX-35, the level of performance regarding the parameters established by the GRI varies depending on the studied company and indicator. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on the biggest Spanish listed companies; thus, the conclusions may differ in other geographic locations, as well as for smaller businesses. Practical implications: This line of research helps to know more about the social reporting policies of big Spanish listed companies. Social implications: The evidence provided by this study helps to know more about the Corporate Social Responsibility policies and sustainability reports and declarations of social and environmental values governing their organizations.

This paper introduces the Special Volume ""The sustainability agenda of the minerals and energy supply and demand network: An integrative analysis of ecological, ethical, economic, and technological dimensions"". The Special Volume contains 84 articles, divided into several themes; sustainability accounting and reporting, corporate social responsibility, future mining challenges, integrative frameworks for sustainability, management aspects, mining in a developing context and new frontiers in the oil andgas industry. The Special Volume also includes two letters on contemporary issues with commentaries on these from experts in the fields, viz., community conflict and land rehabilitation. Insights obtained across these themes are summarized and recommendations are made of what is needed to build upon the findings of this Special volume. A research agenda is proposed for the future from the gaps and synergies identified.

To test this assumption with respect to breakthrough technological innovations, the present paper proposes a theoretical construct and uses it to examine two innovations launched in India, namely genetically modified cotton seeds and a HIV/AIDS drugs cocktail. Because firms decide on innovation outlays to maximize profit without including an explicit CSR component, it develops indicators to examine if any involuntary CSR effort was embedded in the innovation strategy. It confirms that though firms do not invest in innovation to earn CSR credit, some breakthrough technological innovations, not all, can trigger CSR returns. There are tradeoffs between CSR effort and BoP innovation market value. Higher the consumer surplus generated by the innovation, better the bargaining position of the innovator vis-à-vis contestations. The windows of opportunity for generating BoP market value and CSR value are context specific.

To better conceive the role consumers play in activating CSR, this paper provides a multi-level, multi-agent conceptualization of CnSR. Integrating needs-based models of decision making with justice theory, the article interpretively develops the reasons (instrumental, relational, and moral) why variously positioned agents leverage consumers as a force for corporate social responsibility. The paper theoretically expands currently limited conceptions of CnSR by exploring the levels at which diverse agents engage with CnSR (Who and What?) and the needs driving these agents (Why?). The paper suggests that the so-called ""consumer side of CSR"" (Devinney et al. in Stanf Soc Innov Rev:29-37, 2006) is contingent upon the presence, absence, and varying intensities of underlying agent needs.

This paper considers the implementation of CSR by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In this type of organisation, the state acts as a powerful stakeholder as it acts as representative, guarantor and shareholder of public interests. SOEs would seem to be an ideal testing ground for assumptions about CSR that have been imported from the (US) private sector, in particular, how stakeholders can influence and be influenced by CSR policies. Against this background and drawing on diverse literature, this paper presents the features and challenges identified in the SOE sector in relation to CSR. It proposes a systemic view of CSR to identify relevant possibilities to help the advancement of CSR in this sector and from a perspective that considers the wider context of SOEs. Findings suggest that although senior SOE managers show awareness of and commitment to CSR principles through a number of fixed or static elements, there remains an imperative need to enhance their application of CSR in SOE plans, strategies and daily activities, in other words to adopt a more proactive, stakeholder awareness and dynamic view of CSR. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,"Garde-Sánchez, R.; Department of Accounting and Finance, Faculty of Economics and Business Studies, University of Granada, C/Campus Universitario de Cartuja, s/n Postcode 18071, Granada, Spain; email: rgarde@ugr.es",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",10924604,,,,"English","Knowl.

Many corporations incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on a cross-sectional study of 113 companies from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ. We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/ or mission statement and strategic alliances fostered with non-governmental organizations are positively associated with SRQ. This study contributes to strengthening the understanding, promoting discussion on the state of sustainability reporting in the Asia-Pacific context and laying a solid foundation for more aggressive efforts to enhance SRQ. The study identifies the significant drivers currently associated with SRQ. The weak role of the board of directors in upholding the sustainable development agenda through the reporting process is highlighted.

In this context, the main focus is on the need to involve stakeholders in CSR communication processes (Morsing & Schultz, 2006). Findings-The chapter argues that in the sense of CSR communication, stakeholders should be involved in the strategic planning process from the beginning, with respect to the issues that the corporation and targeted stakeholder groups have in common.

There is a growing emphasis on community issues of caring which embed talent development of staff issues (e.g. impacts on skill strengthening) and supply chain issues of performance which embed the environmental concerns and services issues (e.g. impacts on safety and risk-reducing policy). By understanding the reporting elements of sustainability-related reports, it is expected that transparency of community, staff and supply chain issues is needed to gain trust from the public for sustainability.

The research discovered evidence that LFAs were aware of the need to act more responsibly but how far intentions resulted in action was difficult to establish. To date the examination of LFAs has relied heavily on secondary sources and perspectives external to the firm. The firms' own CSR-related texts do not represent a reliable basis for examining CSR among LFAs; they have a high degree of fragmentation and variable quality. In-depth interviews showed that while there is more CSR activity than is made public, incomplete knowledge was a more significant problem than bias or spin. Very few LFAs had conducted a systemic audit of CSR-related activity. Integrative approaches are required to overcome the limitations of single methods, to contribute towards a fuller understanding of responsibility among LFAs, and to inform debate on whether it is necessary to regulate in order to encourage sustainable development in this high-growth sector. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","CSR; low-fare airlines; mobility; sustainable development; travel; United Kingdom","air transportation; airline industry; corporate strategy; mobility; sustainable development; United Kingdom","Coles, T.; Department of Management, University of Exeter, Streatham Court, Rennes Drive, Exeter EX4 4PU, United Kingdom; email: T.E.Coles@exeter.ac.uk",,,09669582,,,,"English","J.

Using the French Vigeo sustainability rating and the Thomson Reuters, we divided 619 firms into groups by their industry sectors, regions, and firm characteristics such as size and age. We premise that innovative investment is needed to prepare tomorrow's profits not only by considering investments in technology and in R&D, but also by dealing with sustainability to human, social, environmental, technical, and economic investments. Consequently, when the firm manipulates its short- and long-run business strategies, the consideration of the correlation between types of investment and CSR initiatives will lead to more cooperating effect on the outcome of investments.

This paper investigates the implementation of instruments for dimensions of CSR that are relevant for the Chinese context and the challenges that Chinese companies face. Based on a survey among 109 Chinese companies, we find that formal instruments to implement CSR are rather common. Companies spend most effort in improving the economic aspects of CSR, such as competitiveness, product innovation and process innovation. Only a small minority of the companies set concrete targets and report the realization of these targets for social and environmental goals. This indicates that the attention to social and environmental aspects of CSR is still rather loose. The most important challenges for improving CSR are strong competitive pressure, insufficient support from the government and/or nongovernmental organizations and high costs of CSR implementation. Multiple regression analysis shows that the use of instruments is positively related to company size and foreign ownership and negatively related to lack of resources and support for CSR by investors and consumers. © 2013 The Author.",,,,,"Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09628770,,,,"English","Bus.

Scholars focusing on CSR in sport have generally examined content-related issues such as implementation, motives or outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to add to that body of knowledge by focusing on process-related issues. Specifically, we explore the decision-making process used in relation to CSR-related programmes in the charitable foundations of the English football clubs.Research methods: Employing a grounded theory method and drawing on the analysis and synthesis of 32 interviews and 25 organisational documents, this research explored managerial decision-making with regard to CSR in English football.Results and findings: The findings reveal that decision-making consists of four simultaneous micro-social processes ('harmonising', 'safeguarding', 'manoeuvring' and 'transcending') that form the platform upon which the managers in the charitable foundations of the English football clubs make decisions. These four micro-social processes together represent assessable transcendence; a process that is fortified by passion, contingent on trust, sustained by communication and substantiated by factual performance enables CSR formulation and implementation in this organisational context.Implications: The significance of this study for the sport management literature is threefold: (1) it focuses on the individual level of analysis, (2) it shifts the focus of the scholarly activity away from CSR content-based research towards more process-oriented approaches and (3) it adds to the limited number of studies that have utilised grounded theory in a rounded manner. © 2014 © 2014 European Association for Sport Management.","charitable foundations; CSR; decision-making; grounded theory; sport",,"Anagnostopoulos, C.; Centre for the International Business of Sport (CIBS), Coventry Business School, Coventry, United Kingdom; email: c.anagnostopoulos@coventry.ac.uk",,"Routledge",16184742,,,,"English","Eur.

How does context and institutional background impact upon the relationship between CSR and Governance? Using in-depth semi-structured interviews from two types of governance systems in three countries over three years, this study has demonstrated that in practice, within different settings, CSR is being used both as a strategy as well as a reaction to different drivers. We call this adaptive governance where governance can be defined as a flexible system of action incorporating strategic and monitoring activities that determines the way a company enacts its responsibilities to its shareholders and stakeholders and which is determined at any given time by the interrelationship of institutional drivers and behavioural norms. Governance systems and their interrelationships with CSR are demonstrated as fluid according to the national and institutional context, economic situation and industry impact. In the eyes of practitioners corporate governance includes both structural and behavioural factors as well as responsibilities and actions towards shareholders and stakeholders. Contextual factors that this research highlights to be important to the incorporation of CSR into governance include the economic environment, national governance system, regulation and soft law, shareholders, national culture, behavioural norms and industry impacts.

The main conclusion of this paper is related to the Bologna effect in Spanish universities. Comparing our results with prior research in this matter, it is demonstrated that the main reason that explains the increase of CSR and ethical education in Spain is the Bologna process and its adaptation to the European Higher Education Area. Also, private universities in Spain are more likely to require an ethics course than public universities.

We find a positive association between the level and change of CSR engagement and the level and change of analyst coverage after considering simultaneity and causality. Based on the first-difference approach, we further find that the change in analyst following from the previous year affects the change in CSR in the current period, whereas the change in CSR from the previous period does not influence the change in analyst following in the current period. Furthermore, we find that the change in CSR engagement as well as the interaction effect of changes in CSR and analyst coverage reduces the change of firm risk. When we examine the CSR strengths and concerns separately, analyst following does not significantly influence firms' CSR strength but CSR concern activities decreases significantly as firms have more analyst followings. We further find the mediating role of financial analysts between CSR concerns (but not CSR strengths) and firm risk. We maintain that analysts provide indirect but additional social pressure to the firms to eventually reduce their irresponsible activities. Taken together, we interpret these results to support the stakeholder theory-based conflict-resolution explanation that considers CSR engagement as a vehicle to reduce conflicts of interest between managers and noninvesting stakeholders but not the overinvestment hypothesis that views CSR as a waste of valuable resources at the cost of shareholders. © 2014 The Authors.

Institutional CSR activities that target secondary stakeholders are negatively associated with firm risk, measured by total risk and systematic risk. Technical CSR that target primary stakeholders are positively associated with firm financial performance, measured by Tobin’s Q, ROA, and cash flow returns. Our results, based on a sample of S&P 500 component firms over the period of 1995–2009, are consistent with the risk management view of “altruistic” CSR activities and with the stakeholder salience theory. We also show that the impact of CSR activities on risk varies with the ethical climate, as proved in our subsample analyses on pre- and post-Sarbanes–Oxley periods. Our empirical analyses mitigate possible omitted variables and endogeneity concerns that are often overlooked in previous research.

Salience of stakeholder groups founded in stakeholder theory forms the basis for this investigation because of the rising influence of a range of different stakeholders on corporate disclosures in the mining and mineral industry in Western countries. The aim is to examine whether such stakeholders appear to be salient in the emerging Chinese context. The contents of 176 corporate annual and CSR reports produced by all mining and minerals companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in the four year period 2007 to 2010 were analyzed. Results indicate that in addition to the central government, salient stakeholders with a significant impact now include international consumers, while unexpectedly mining industry associations, local communities and employees are not considered as salient as they do not have a significant impact on CSR reporting practice. The main policy implication is that considerable scope remains for improving accountability through CSR reporting to be encouraged by incorporating the views of the current stakeholder groups exhibiting low salience in the mining and minerals industry in China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The right to health is one of the human rights secured in international law and in the national legislation of a majority of States. This chapter will provide examples of investment cases concerning tobacco control measures, imposed by the Host States for the purpose of improving public health, though challenged by the tobacco companies under International Investment Agreements (IIAs) in investment tribunals. These specific examples cast rather general questions regarding the legal framework of Co international investment framework and its role in providing sufficient policy space for Host States to implement the public policies and to ensure that foreign companies adhere to the CSR standards. Methodology/approach-In order to investigate what are the implications of the CSR debate on international investment law on the example of tobacco industry, the author performs a literature review and analyze two tobacco disputes and its possible implication on the public health debate and protection of foreign investors. Findings-This case study illustrates the complex paradigm that interlink economic and human rights obligations of States on one side of the spectrum and property rights and social responsibilities of tobacco companies on the other side.

The mediating effect of perceived brand quality on the relationship between CSR performance and brand preference is also studied. Design/methodology/approach – In 2011, 243 valid responses to questionnaire surveys were collected from a convenience sample in China. Regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings – Customers’ brand preference can be enhanced by CSR performance. Performance in each of the three CSR domains (i.e. environment, society and stakeholders) positively impacts brand preference, although to different degrees. The impact of CSR on stakeholders has the strongest influence on Chinese customers’ brand preference among the three CSR domains. Perceived brand quality was found to be a mediator of the relationship between CSR performance and brand preference. Research limitations/implications – This research studies the relationship between CSR performance and brand preference. Results show CSR performance is not the strongest predictor of branding outcomes, its explanatory power is comparatively weaker than that of perceived brand quality. Additionally, we found a mediating effect of perceived brand quality on the relationship between CSR performance and brand preference. Practical implications – Brands can be more attractive to Chinese consumers when brands take appropriate investments in CSR activities. A socially responsible brand is not guaranteed to yield a competitive advantage. Instead a competitive advantage will more likely result through the employment of the appropriate CSR strategies, with a focus on stakeholders’ interests. Originality/value – The current research contributes to the literature by finding that not all CSR activities are equally effective. Customers in emerging markets still appear to be focused more on the quality of brands and, to some extent, stakeholder CSR practice, as these provide direct benefits to customers. Findings of this study also support the notion that Chinese consumers are beginning to use CSR information to evaluate brands. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand preference; CSR performance; Hotel; Perceived brand quality",,"Shi, G.; Marketing Department, Macau University of Science and TechnologyChina",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",08876045,,,,"English","J.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether the family structure of Moroccan companies influences CSR adoption and how it affects financial performance. We used a framework combining stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory and stewardship theory and investigated the linkage between family structure, CSR orientation and financial performance.

Three of the four components (i.e., community, employees, and consumers) of CSR positively affect employees' organizational identification and knowledge-sharing behavior. However, while the effects of community-related CSR actions on the employees' outcomes are stronger for individualistic employees, the effect of employee-related CSR actions on organizational identification is stronger for collectivist employees. The findings are unique in the sense that we show empirically that different employees are influenced by different types of CSR actions.

The research, presented in this paper, employs stakeholder theory to examine the perceptions of investors and sharebrokers on CSR in the context of a fast growing country, India. The data has been collected by using semistructured survey instrument. The findings of the study highlight that the respondents in both categories of stakeholder groups agree that CSR-oriented companies enjoy higher levels of investor confidence, which is reflected in higher stock prices, and leads to enhanced reputation and corporate goodwill. The research demonstrates that Indian companies are in fact implementing CSR initiatives and that stakeholders have a considerable interest in such initiatives. Both the groups expect higher CSR disclosures from large corporations and multinational companies operating in India. Educational initiatives have received maximum attention from the both the groups of stakeholders followed by the environmental issues. Investors are least aware of healthcare and rural development initiatives possibly because of the relatively low penetration of Indian financial markets into the rural areas. This study demonstrates that the stakeholder theory is a useful tool for collecting and evaluating CSR data and explains that the stakeholder perception of CSR performance determines corporate initiatives to a certain level.

Social innovation as a field of research is rather new but in the last ten years it has gained an amazing popularity among scholars, particularly with respect to pressing social issues like poor education, poverty, hunger, illness or social injustice. It is obvious why this field is more present in research, as social problems that affect a large number of populations are significant and their impact could be scaled and measured appropriately. The paper is meant to help academics and research scholars advance research in the social innovation field, by building on existing streams of research presented in the current paper, which need further investigation.

A semiotic analysis of briefing communications between client stakeholders and designers provides evidence of the significance and importance of stakeholder interpretation and understanding of design, empirical data being drawn from a qualitative study of NHS hospital construction projects in the UK. It is contended that stakeholders engage with a project through communicative signs and artefacts of design, referencing personal cognitive knowledge in acts of interpretation that may be different from those of designers and externally appointed client advisers. Such interpretations occur in addition to NHS client and design team efforts to 'engage' with and 'understand' stakeholders using a variety of methods. Social semiotic theorizations indicate how narrative strategies motivate the formulation of signs and artefacts in briefing work, the role of sign authors and sign readers being elucidated as a result. Findings are contextualized against current understandings of briefing communications and stakeholder management practices, a more socially attuned understanding of breifing countering some of the process-led improvement models that have characterized much of the post-Egan report literature.

Few research works in the CSP empirical literature have studied the relationship between stakeholder power and CSP. Design/methodology/approach – Stakeholder theory is used as a theoretical framework to explain how shareholder voting power can influence the CSP level of French publicly listed companies. Stakeholder theory is tested through the operationalization of Ullmann’s (1985) three-dimensional model. Hypotheses related to shareholder voting power, strategic posture and financial performance are formulated through a literature review. A Data Envelopment Analysis approach was presented as a strong tool to measure CSP level. Multiple linear regressions were undertaken to test the hypotheses in a sample of 129 French companies between 2006 and 2007. Findings – The results indicate that companies with dispersed ownership and high proportion of institutional shareholders record a high score of CSP. Strategic posture measured by the implementation of environmental certification standard was positively and significantly related to CSP. Financial performance does not affect significantly the level of CSP. Originality/value – This paper is the first to empirically analyse the relationship between Ullmann’s three-dimensional model and CSP level in the French context.

Design/methodology/approach: Embedded multiple case study utilising quantitative content analysis and readability indices. Findings: As expected, Nordic banks' headquarters' disclosure quantity and readability outperforms those of their Baltic subsidiaries/branches. However, no convergence of intra-group CSR disclosure practices is detected. Banks' response to the legitimacy gap seems to depend on CSR reporting strategy: passive superficial (Baltic subsidiaries/branches, ABLV), passive thorough (Swedbank), intermediate (Danske Bank) and active (SEB). Passive and intermediate strategy pursuers' CSR disclosure quantity and readability remains stable during the financial crisis period. However, active strategy pursuers increase disclosure quantity and reduce readability indicating possible stakeholder manipulation attempts. Both intermediate and active strategy pursuers disclose in greater detail steps taken to improve CSR behaviour. Research limitations/implications: Results may not be transferable to the pre-2007 period, to other contexts and to Western European subsidiaries. Practical implications: Introduction of plain English into CSR communication could enable to decrease stakeholder manipulation attempts made through CSR texts.

Despite the argument that independent CSRA appraisals would improve the credibility of information disclosed, the majority of CSR reports in Malaysia are still not independently assured. The aim of this study is to understand the factors that impede CSRA practices among public-listed manufacturing companies in Malaysia. The theory of reasoned action was used to underpin arguments on the reluctance of managers to undertake CSRA. Design/methodology/approach: Online questionnaire surveys were employed to obtain respondents' perceptions on the factors that hinder CSRA practices. The target respondents comprised of CSR managers, corporate communications executives and customer relations personnel. Findings: This study provides evidence that the behavioural reluctance of managers to undertake CSRA was due to their attitudes and subjective norms towards independence assurance. The subjective norms due to the risk towards corporate reputation and the exposure to public scrutiny were the main factors that impede CSRA practices among manufacturing companies in Malaysia. The managers' attitude towards cost, data management systems and the uncertainty of the merits of CSRA were also compelling factors that hinder independent CSRA. These factors seemed to override incentives to provide credible information to stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the study are limited to the perceptions of CSR managers, corporate communications executives and customer relations personnel responsible for CSR activities of the manufacturing industries in Malaysia. The results of the study suggest that further initiatives or pressure from stakeholders or regulatory authorities may be needed to convince the companies of the benefits of undertaking third-party assurance practices as such actions would provide a platform for the companies to enhance the credibility of their CSR reporting. Practical implications: The findings gleaned from this study would be of interest to the relevant corporate bodies and regulatory authorities with a view to formulating strategies to improve CSRA practices among organisations in Malaysia. Originality/value: The findings from the study offer initial insights into the impediments to CSRA practices in an emerging economy.

Only a few studies have researched value creation from stakeholder perspective looking at how stakeholders appropiate value or the processes or activities by which stakeholders create value. Consequently to date, certain questions still remain unanswered regarding how a firm should treat stakeholders in order to create value. Several questions arise specifically from the stakeholder's side: What does ""value"" mean for a particular group of stakeholders and how do firms create these different types of value? How do we measure the value created by stakeholders? The purpose of this paper is to answer these questions from Amartya Sen's Capability Approach, identifying and measuring stakeholders' capabilities in the value creation process. Stakeholder Capability is the adequate concept for understanding stakeholder welfare rather than the utility function concept. The empirical evidence comes from an in-depth case study of the company The Grobo Group and its stakeholders. According to the results, the following stakeholder capabilities are relevant to value creation: being employable, being autonomus, being innovative, being entreprenurial, being responsive, being socially integrated, being emphatic, being ""green"" and being healthy. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Amartya Sen; Capabilities; Corporate Social Responsibility; Empirical model; Stakeholder theory; Value creation",,"Garriga, E.; EADA Business School, Arago, 204, Barcelona, 08011, Spain; email: egarriga@eada.edu",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

The four activities are environmental friendliness, community support, selling locally produced products, and treating employees fairly. Behavioral loyalty is measured by share-of-wallet (SOW). We control for other retailer attributes that drive attitudes and SOW, and examine how the market is segmented in terms of consumer response. We partition the total effect of CSR on SOW into a direct effect and an indirect effect mediated through attitude towards the store. These effects differ by CSR activity and customer segment. The effects on attitude are positive and positive attitude enhances SOW, so the indirect effects on SOW are positive. While we generally find positive total effects, the total effect of one of the CSR activities, environmental friendliness, is significantly negative for one group of consumers. The magnitude of CSR's total impact on SOW is not only statistically significant but also managerially meaningful in an industry where every share point carries a substantial dollar amount. We characterize the customer segments and conclude with implications for how best a retailer can manage its CSR initiatives. •We study the impact of retailers' CSR efforts on consumers' attitudinal and behavioral loyalty.•The impact on share-of-wallet varies across segments and CSR activities.•Selling locally produced products has strong universal appeal.•But over 50% of our sample is turned off by environmental friendliness.•For 25% of the sample, improvements in environmental friendliness increase SOW.•There is a strong case for benefit segmentation in CSR efforts. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Attitude towards store; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Dimensions of CSR; Loyalty; Retail store patronage; Share of wallet",,"Ailawadi, K.L.; Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College, 100 Tuck Hall, Hanover, NH 03755, United States; email: kusum.ailawadi@dartmouth.edu",,"Elsevier",01678116,,IJRME,,"English","Int.

Information technology (IT) is an essential environmental compliance component under the rubric of green IT, which can include the designing, manufacturing, implementing, and disposing of IT components and the supporting electrical and cooling infrastructure. Green IT has numerous compliance, governance, and control issues, and management needs assurance that green IT metrics reported to management, regulators, and other stakeholders are accurate, complete, and timely. Boards, executives, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), and the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) view internal auditors as control experts. This paper summarizes a survey of internal auditors as to what internal auditors should be doing in this domain and what they are actually doing. The results indicate that even though internal auditors believe that they should be more involved in green IT activities, their current involvement is limited to the traditional role as assurance provider, not as facilitators or consultants. The results also suggest that internal auditors' current involvement in green IT activities varies depending on the types of environmental sustainability strategies practiced by their organizations, whereas their perceived roles in green IT activities did not.","Corporate social responsibility; Green IT; Internal auditor; Sustainability",,,,"American Accounting Association",08887985,,,,"English","J.

The paper therefore aims to improve the effectiveness of CSR in the continent by making companies accountable for the veracity of statements they have voluntarily put out in the public domain. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts the stakeholder and legitimacy theories and information regulation as its framework of analysis. Following a discourse on the developments in and limitations of sustainability, the paper constructs an argument in line with these theories how these reports can still be utilised to make meaningful contribution towards strengthening CSR through accountability for false and misleading statements. Findings: Corporations have a stake in information in sustainability reports with regard to their corporate image and reputation. Therefore, under the appropriate framework, utilising corporate accountability for false and misleading statements by companies has promise for making CSR more effective. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this research is the political will of national governments in Africa to undertake such an exercise and the relative ability of civil society groups in light of the power of corporations to effectively hold them to account through the models proposed. Originality/value: The paper is interdisciplinary, drawing upon both management and legal theories. A significant contribution of this research is its pragmatic approach which goes beyond calling for legal platform for CSR by recommending a model for accountability within the existing voluntary CSR framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Africa; Corporate accountability; Corporate human rights abuse; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental rights; Extractive industries; Informational regulation; Legitimacy theory; Stakeholder theory; Sustainability reporting",,"Emeseh, E.; Department of Law and Criminology, Aberystwyth University, Aberystwyth, United Kingdom; email: ege@aber.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1754243X,,,,"English","Int.

A qualitative comparative case study design was followed. Through the literature review in the first phase, three previously unrelated components, namely Warren's (2003) evolution of business legitimacy theory, Jensen's (2001) three descriptors of the company as an agent in society; and Holmström's (1997) social systemic Public Relations paradigm, were combined to develop a theoretical framework against which the websites and the annual and sustainability reports of three South African retailers were analysed in the second phase. Analyses were done at two levels: the degree to which community relations and governance issues were represented at strategic level and the achievement of specific impact objectives at technical level. All three retailers channelled CSR activities through either a foundation or a trust registered as a non-profit entity. This could be indicative of the importance assigned to their CRS initiatives.

This issue has special significance in a country that is one of the fastest growing economies in south Asia and also particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with a diverse group of 32 managers of large enterprises operating in a variety of industries. Findings - The positive attitudes observed suggest that various programmes adopted to promote CSR have had some effect. However, sustainable development and environmental issues tend to remain on the periphery of managers' understandings and perceptions of CSR. Research limitations/implications - This study aids understanding of how business managers may respond to CSR promotional campaigns. Further studies in other comparable countries, and in other settings where CSR is poorly established, are encouraged in order to provide more comprehensive insights and overcome the limited sample size of the current study. Practical implications - While insights to how the managers of local enterprises can be persuaded to become more effectively engaged in CSR are provided, a need to foster a more comprehensive notion of CSR is also identified.

First, communication is being fostered gradually between a private sector audit programme and the public labour inspection, pointing toward ways in which private and public action can play complementary roles in the promotion of labour standards in value chains. Second, the design of this CSR initiative seeks to extend monitoring beyond first-tier suppliers to identify vulnerable workers in subcontracted firms at lower tiers within value chains, in response to a response to a commission report of the Sao Paulo City Council, which advised that retailers cannot use clauses in supplier contracts to outsource responsibility for labour standards in their value chains. © W.

The company is active mainly in the men's wear segment, and sells its products through an extensive network of stores as well as online. It places great importance on crafting individual images for its brands in order to ensure that they are easily differentiated from its competitors' brands and that they connect with consumers on an emotional level. In January 2012 Madura Fashion & Lifestyle centralised its research and development (R&D) activities in a new Knowledge Management Centre (KMC), which is responsible for all stages of new product development-from the creation of new fibres to the mocking-up of finished items of apparel using computer aided design (CAD) software. The KMC is the only centre of its kind in India and represents Madura Fashion & Lifestyle's commitment to innovation, and to providing consumers with quality products. The company engages in various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in a bid to limit the impact of its operations on the environment. Also, it is heavily involved with social projects which aim to improve the quality of life of people who live in the areas in which it operates. Such projects are concerned with education, the provision of health care, and helping people from rural or deprived parts of India to establish sustainable livelihoods. In order to increase its share of the domestic apparel market, Madura Fashion & Lifestyle has identified India's emerging women's wear and children's wear markets, as well as growing demand for casual wear, as opportunities for diversification. However, the company faces challenges in the retail environment. Although Madura Fashion & Lifestyle is a large company relative to most apparel retailers in India, it may not be sufficiently diversified to compete with large-format retailers and international brands. Indeed, the company's portfolio of brands is focused heavily on the premium and luxury segments, and two of its five core brands cater exclusively to men. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2014.",,"Commerce; Computer aided design; Knowledge management; Bangalore , India; Children's wear; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); International brands; Large companies; Quality product; Research and development; Sustainable livelihood; Sales",,,"Textiles Intelligence Ltd.",02684764,,,,"English","Text.

By referring to the traditional economic order quantity model, the paper proposes logistics carbon footprint model which takes transport and inventory into account. Then it solves the model by calculating the values of order quantity, carbon footprint and revenue using the method of optimization. Findings: By solving and comparing the two models, economic order quantity model and carbon footprint model, it gets some results, such as carbon optimization order quantity, the effects of order quantity deviating from economic or carbon order quantity on economic or carbon footprint values, which can give some meaningful insights for corporation to look for reduction opportunities by operations adjustment.

In the years following economic liberalization, India witnessed rapid economic growth and thus, a new era of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in India began. Today, CSR has become embedded into corporate activities in the form of synchronizing their business activities with society and environment, thus ensuring good governance practices and corporate ethics. The skewness of private sector CSR activities is a thought-provoking idea which seeks more government role in CSR activities. In 2010, Department of Public Enterprise (DPE), Government of India introduced 'mandatory' CSR policies for 249 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).

Methodology/approach - We explore the implicit or explicit strategies of 100 largest companies in the world towards SMEs as mentioned in their annual and CSR reports. This approach takes in particular stock of the 'narratives' developed by MNEs as an expression of their intended and (perceived) realised strategies. Findings - The analysis of company statements show a country of origin effect in that European firms are clearly amongst the leaders in experimenting with inclusive business strategies that include SMEs. However, their number still remains limited. Sectors like banking and retail have developed the most interesting examples that are also spread over a large number of functions. Originality and value - Although the results are not yet very radical, the developed taxonomy for the different types of approaches in which MNEs take a more or less active position towards SMES provides material for further studies. It can be applied in studying leading (betterpractice) cases in order to help policy makers and business strategists to develop better business models for inclusive growth.

Business schools emerged toward the end of the 19th century after U.S. Supreme Court judgments absolved corporate directors from the duty of adhering to social missions embodied in their limited liability charters. This coincided with the rise of neoclassical economics that placed shareholdersabove other stakeholders. As evolving societal demands have forced businesses to consider business ethics, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability in their performance, and as AACSB has added these learning objectives, business schools have reactively responded by adding new courses to their existing curricula. However, these ""saddle-bag"" approaches do not integrate the topics into the core functional areas of business.

Design/methodology/approach: Exploratory and explanatory survey was utilized on a sample of 450 employees selected using a multistage sampling technique. Structured questionnaire was used to extract both nominal and ordinal data, the latter's items were anchored on a five-point Likert scale. Descriptive, principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression was used to analyze the data. Findings: PCA of 32 items representing CHRSR yielded ten components while that of employee job outcomes yielded seven components reflecting the multidimensional nature of the constructs. Results showed that the selected firms have largely satisfied both HR and moral expectations. Regression results showed generally significant effect of CHRSR on employee job outcomes such as employee retention, satisfaction, commitment and pride.

Prior literature documents firms participating in environmental initiatives to report relatively stronger financial performance. Moreover, firms with superior performance have been shown to engage in greater levels of earnings management. A natural question that arises is to what extent do firms with environmental initiatives engage in earnings management to report better financial performance? Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on two theoretical frameworks, external monitoring and internal corporate culture, to predict an inverse association between environmental initiatives and earnings management. The authors test this prediction using an earnings management regression model, estimating discretionary accruals using the modified-Jones approach. Findings: The study finds that firms with environmental initiatives exhibit lower earnings management proxied by absolute and income-increasing total discretionary accruals. The authors further find pollution prevention and climate related initiatives to help explain this inverse association. The results imply that firms practising environmental responsibility report better financial performance, with the most likely reason being due to real economic performance rather than through earnings management techniques.

These cases were purposefully selected as they all represented relationships that demonstrated social partnerships characteristics, and they had all attracted acclaim by their peers. They differed in terms of their societal problems and relationship duration. Semi-structured interviews were held with managers and employees from each social partnership, where they discussed all aspects of the partnership lifecycle from pre-collaborative conditions through to outcomes. In total, 50 semi-structured interviews were held with members of the private, nonprofit and public sectors.Purpose - This paper aims to identify models of best practice and examines the manner in which such social partnerships attract new partners and scale-up their solutions. Social responsibility initiatives that incorporate multiple sectors have the capacity to challenge unsustainable practice and pave the way for model solutions towards the societal problems we face globally.Findings - Social partnerships pool skills, knowledge and finance across sectors, concentrating on specific societal issues of mutual concern. Resultant successful initiatives act as catalysts in soliciting further support. Three primary pathways exist for successful social partnerships that wish to evolve: expansion, replication and refinement. Focused attention and resources, through the formation of social responsibility clusters, can lead to sustainable solutions.Originality/value - Social partnerships within the Australian context are under-represented; this paper addresses this by examining three best practice exemplars. The rationale for incorporating new partners and sharing success is discussed and supported by a model of social responsibility cluster formation.Practical implications - There are many organisations wishing to move on from philanthropic exchange towards more meaningful integrated relationships. This paper highlights the value of both within sector and cross-sector collaboration to achieve organisational outcomes. It provides some insight into the entry points for both nonprofit organisations as well as small- to medium-sized private sector organisations that would otherwise consider social investment in large-scale societal problems beyond their reach. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Cross-sector; Nonprofit; Social partnerships; Social responsibility clusters",,"McDonald, S.; School of Communication and Creative Arts, Deakin UniversityAustralia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

The idea is to understand how Exame portrays sustainable development and corporate sustainability in its Sustainable Corporation Guide. Design/methodology/approach - The authors collected material covering five years of the Exame Sustainable Corporation Guide, from 2005 to 2009. The data were analyzed using discourse analysis. Findings - The authors consider that the ""evolution"" promoted in this particular business media discourse on CSR and sustainability assumes, and stands for the economically dominant paradigm. In this sense, it cannot be viewed as an alternative that can realistically protect local environments. Despite the idea of a neutral journalistic approach, the concerns depicted in the publication still rely on profits and the chase for business opportunities. The authors also discuss to what extent this particular publication supports a specific hegemonic discourse. The different sustainability indexes adopted only reproduce practices that are desired and that align with the realities of the so-called developed nations. Research limitations/implications - The paper focuses on what kind of sustainability discourse is propagated by the business media, and more specifically, by a well-known Guide published by a popular Brazilian business magazine. Through this method of diffusion, a specific kind of CSR and sustainability are drawn up that support the capitalist business model. This analysis can raise issues, such as the existence of a ""dark side"" of sustainability. Further investigation of the diffusion of the CSR and sustainability relationship in business media discourse, as well as of the uncritical adoption of western CSR models, might invigorate the discussion and provide valuable insights. Originality/value - There is a distinct lack of studies on sustainability and CSR in emergent economies. Such initiatives can be developed in different ways because emergent countries' contexts may differ. Since Brazil is currently an important player in the economic and political arenas, understanding how the notion of sustainability is being discussed in the Brazilian business media can lead to important implications for corporate practices and organizational relationships with stakeholders, both internally as well as externally.

Second, it shows that the backshoring practices used by a powerful group of Pan-Indian buyer-exporters, who increasingly behave like global buyers, further reproduce the logic of the local sweatshop, hence reinforcing the limitations of corporate approaches to labour standards. © W.

After this, the relevance of sustainability for German real estate companies is discussed. Their empirical section contains an international comparison. Finally, they present an analysis checking the implementation of CS for the main 135 German real estate companies.Findings – The present analysis shows that German real estate companies compare well with their international counterparts, in 2012 representing 15 per cent of all real estate firms reporting on the basis of the Global Reporting Initiative. However, of the 135 companies in Germany surveyed, only a small proportion classify themselves as CS and CSR (corporate social responsibility) enterprises. This number could be rapidly increased by better documentation of companies’ commitment to sustainability.Practical implications – The study’s importance lies in the overview it provides of CS activities in the German real estate industry. In addition, it provides hints on how companies can improve their documentation to classify as CSR enterprises.

Using the 'Global-100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World' list (known also as 'Global-100') to select the SRI companies, we found that, in the period 2000-2010, the returns of the SRI portfolios were on average higher compared with the corresponding returns of the market indexes. The annual average difference in returns of the SRI portfolios (with dividends) was 5.26 % and 5.69 % relative to the FTSE100 and FTSE4GOOD indexes (the total return versions), respectively, but the differences in returns in the whole period, in individual years and in other sub-periods were in most cases not statistically significant. Positive performance of SRI stocks in the whole sample is, however, evidenced by risk-adjusted measures such as the modified Sharpe ratio (MSR) and certainty equivalent (CEQ) returns, as well as by incorporating various levels of transaction costs. Furthermore, a simple trading strategy relying on selection of SRI stocks from the Global-100 list would beat the market indexes in the whole period 2000-2010, even after inclusion of various levels of transaction costs. We also estimated the Fama-French and Carhart multi-factor models and found that the returns of the SRI portfolios cannot be consistently explained by conventional factors other than the market factor. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); London Stock Exchange (LSE); SRI stocks; Stock market returns; Sustainable investments",,"Brzeszczyński, J.; Department of Accountancy, Economics and Finance, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; email: j.brzeszczynski@hw.ac.uk",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

The paper highlights the disregard for externalities as a fundamental obstacle to sustainable reporting and proposes taxation designs to recognise the costs associated with externalities as the basis for equitable reporting, pricing and sustainable business practices. Design/methodology/approach: The approach taken uses Smith's (1776) tenets of a good tax, to consider characteristics of taxation that may be harnessed for financial reporting, valuation, economic substance and legal form. Findings: The findings reveal a case for further examination of the efficacy of taxation, alongside a full-cost accounting approach, to benefit sustainable reporting.

While the effects of corporate social responsibility on consumer perception and firm performance have been widely investigated, research has yet to explore how and why these expectations themselves change over time. In this study, I use institutional theory and the theory of structuration from sociology to evaluate the shift in norms regarding environmental responsibility in the United States over a thirty-year period. A qualitative and quantitative content analysis of newspaper articles shows that environmental discourse has shifted from an emphasis on protection of the environment against toxic, modern encroachments, to a set of frames that emphasize the efficiency of technology and efficient use, if not improvement of, the environment. The stakeholders held responsible for protecting the environment have also changed from government actors to company and consumer stakeholders. These findings help to reveal the discursive underpinnings of CSR perceptions at a societal level and have implications for conceptualizing the legitimation of environmental corporate practice. © The Author(s) 2014.","corporate social responsibility; CSR; institutional theory sustainability; macromarketing; structuration",,"Humphreys, A.; Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University, 1870S.

Against this backdrop, a growing body of literature focuses on compassion in organizations, primarily at the individual and group level of analysis. However, the current economic system under which the U.S. economy operates might create a fundamental tension in this regard. That is, the tenets of American corporate capitalism (ACC) might be in contradiction to compassionate organizing. ACC is an ideology that emphasizes, among other things, the pursuit of self-interest, competition, market exchange, consumerism, and using a profit/loss criterion to make decisions in organizations. Members of a society in which ACC is dominant may come to internalize the beliefs and values underlying ACC (Kasser, Cohn, Kanner, & Ryan, 2007), which may be at odds with compassionate organizing. Indeed, management scholarship has tended to be dominated by a concern with economic performance and efficiency. In addition to this focus on efficiency and competitiveness as ultimate outcomes of interest, perhaps management scholars should also focus on social problems and social welfare concerns. Consistent with contemporary interest in compassion, key to advancing our knowledge in this area would be identifying the conditions under which organizations inflict the least harm and alleviate the most suffering. In this regard, several directions for future organizational research are provided. © The Author(s) 2013.","affect/emotions; corporate social responsibility; downsizing/layoffs/restructuring",,"George, J.

So far, however, research on supply chain risk management has largely neglected these sustainability issues. Most importantly, little is known about how sustainability issues manifest themselves as risks and how they create losses for focal firms. Without an in-depth understanding of this materialization process, conceptualizations of sustainability risks will remain vague and effective management frameworks cannot be developed. We address this important research gap by means of a transdisciplinary approach and provide a concise description of how sustainability issues in supply chains materialize as risks for focal firms. Building on this mechanism and drawing on stakeholder theory, we develop a conceptualization of sustainability risks which lays the basis for future investigations in this respective field. In addition, we devise a viable management concept for sustainability-related supply chain risks. The proposed concept can help firms to mitigate sustainability issues in global supply chains, thus making them less vulnerable to losses resulting from these risks.

Further, by taking the social context into account, this research examine the moderating effect of consumer engagement in community social capital on the relationship between perceived retailers' CSR action and retailer legitimization. Design/methodology/approach: Pre-test was conducted with 144 students to validate the measurement model. A total of 220 responses from US consumers were used for the main-test, and multiple group analysis in structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed in order to test the structural model. Findings: The result indicates that when retailers are perceived as adhering to social norms through their CSR actions, they gain legitimacy and support from the consumers within the community. Further, consumer social capital moderates the relationship between perceived CSR and retailer legitimacy. Practical implications: Findings of this research can provide retail marketers with practical implication in developing their CSR strategy catering to the community members. Understanding consumers with higher level of social capital investment will increase the capability and effectiveness of the retailers' CSR activities. Originality/value: This research offers theoretical contributions to the current research stream of CSR studies by testing the moderating effect of consumers' engagement in the social environment on consumers' legitimization and support toward retailers that perform CSR activities.

The purpose of this paper is to address this issue and explore the CSR strategies of transnational corporations (TNCs) regarding their impact on poverty alleviation within the construction industry in India, in order to gain an insight on how business is engaged in the improvement of the situation of the poor, and to derive recommendations on how pertinent CSR strategies can be further developed. Design/methodology/approach: The paper collects primary data for monitoring the CSR activities of the largest TNCs within the construction industry in India to conduct a CSR ranking of the sample TNCs in terms of CSR engagement with particular focus on poverty alleviation with respect to the MDGs. Findings: The findings show that the core business-oriented focus of the CSR activities of the construction industry is mainly on MDG 1 and 7. Nevertheless, the construction industry still needs to gear its core business towards business models that enhance the housing conditions of the poor and to improve the general social conditions within this industry. Based on the findings the paper suggests a selected industry-specific governmental CSR guidance to propel the implementation of CSR as business case. Practical implications: This work provides policy implications for the government and outlines the areas for business practitioners where CSR strategies should be enhanced to meet social needs and contribute to the alleviation of poverty.

The selected variables are CEO duality, the presence of women in the board, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, emission reduction initiatives, company’s risk premium, financial leverage and industry’s profile. Design/methodology/approach – The environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure score is used as a proxy for the extent of CSR disclosure calculated by Bloomberg. The influence of plausible variables on the ESG disclosure score and its sub-categories was examined by using the least squares dummy variable model (LSDV) incorporating 100 companies listed on Standard & Poor’s 500 Index for the period 2009-2012. Findings – The results show that the emission reduction initiatives and GHG emissions influence positively the extent of ESG score. In addition, slight differences exist concerning the determinants of different types of disclosures. Furthermore, it is illustrated that a company’s industrial profile seems to have differences among the extent of the different types of disclosure. Research limitations/implications – The sample of companies is based on the US companies incorporating only large-sized ones. Originality/value – The study extends previous studies with the inclusion of both traditional and innovative determinants of the CSR disclosure in USA taking into account four years of corporate data.

Interviews with experts from 35 Canadian corporations were conducted. The research showed that the content of the reports was determined by following standards, conducting an internal evaluation, and other methods. Five corporations were found to develop fully integrated reports, while another 15 included some sustainability aspects in their annual reports. The extent of external stakeholder involvement in the development of the report varied widely, but the majority of the corporations considered stakeholder input. Data collection was handled by a number of different individuals and groups, with sustainability departments often taking a lead role. Twenty-five corporations relied exclusively on internal personnel to write the report, with the remaining corporations using a combination of internal and external writers. A number of key challenges in developing sustainability reports were identified, including timelines, data collection, selecting content, and striking an appropriate balance in reporting. The reports were used internally in a number of different ways, including enhancing employee awareness and engagement and as an internal reference tool. A number of potential future uses of sustainability reports were also mentioned, such as improving the ability to track real-time performance. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); Reporting; Sustainability",,"Searcy, C.; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, M5B 2K3, Canada; email: cory.searcy@ryerson.ca",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Operational risk occurs when sponsors insist on changing the rules or format of the event, or when they exercise undue influence on its content, timing, location or participants. The primary source of reputational risk is increased public sensitivity to the negative health impacts of some product categories, most prominently those of tobacco, alcohol, gambling and products that are high in fat, salt or sugar that may make it contentious for a sport property to partner with companies in these product classes. Similar controversy from public sensitivity may emerge around issues of corporate social responsibility, as expectations grow regarding the impact of a company's actions on society.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a multilevel approach, integrating the institutional, organisational and individual levels of analysis in a whole model that explains corporate transparency. The paper uses a sample composed of 98 non-financial listed Spanish companies for the period 2004-2010, Findings: The results show heterogeneity between external board members. Proprietary directors, representing shareholders, tend to promote adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines in order to increase value for shareholders. On the contrary, independent directors are risk adverse in relation to the effect that CSR information disclosure could have on their professional reputations. Research limitations/implications: The sample could be improved, including companies from different countries and more years for the analysis, since the period studied comprises a particular economic setting (2008-2010), a global financial crisis. Practical implications: Although these results from the Spanish context, the authors recommend that regulatory bodies incorporate provisions into good governance codes that guarantee the existence of quality and comparable CSR information that favours stakeholders' decision taking. Originality/value: The image that society has about a company comes from the opinions created from the mass media. The arguments proposed by agenda-setting theory can be managed by companies as a strategic mechanism to respond to society expectations. At present, two of the most studied aspects are the ethical and sustainable behaviours of organisations. These aspects are related to the characteristics of boards of directors, especially to external directors. Independent directors may disagree with disclosing information about CSR practices because they fear that this information would affect their professional reputations, since they are not specialised in these topics. However, proprietary directors favour the disclosure of this information in an attempt to reduce the cost of capital and risk perceived by investors, especially in more sustainable companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Boards of directors; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); External directors; Independent directors; Media pressure; Proprietary directors; Social responsibility",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",00251747,,,,"English","Manage.

In some instances, these investments enhance shareholder value. However, in other cases, altruistic managers or managers who privately benefit from the positive attention arising from these activities may choose to make socially responsible investments even if they are not value enhancing. Given this backdrop, we investigate the various factors that motivate firm managers to make socially responsible investments. We find that larger firms, firms with greater free cash flow, and higher advertising outlays demonstrate higher levels of corporate social responsibility (CSR). We also find that companies with stronger institutional ownership are less likely to invest in CSR - which casts doubt on the argument that these investments are designed to promote shareholder value. Consistent with the literature that explores how CEO personal attributes influence corporate decision making, we find that female CEOs, younger CEOs, and managers who donate to both Republican and Democratic parties are significantly more likely to invest in CSR. This latter result suggests that CSR investments may not be driven solely for altruistic reasons, but instead may be part of a broader strategy to create goodwill and/or help maintain good political relations. Finally, we find a strong positive connection between the level of media scrutiny surrounding the firm and its CEO, and the level of CSR investment. This finding suggests that media attention helps induce firms to make socially responsible investments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Media coverage; Political connections",,"Houston, J.F.; Department of Finance and Real Estate, Warrington College of Business Administration, University of Florida, PO Box 117168, Gainesville, FL 32611-7168, United States; email: houston@ufl.edu",,"Elsevier",09291199,,,,"English","J.

Methodology/approach-This study explores the significance of employees' involvement and scepticism upon CSR initiatives and focuses on the effects it may have upon word of mouth (WOM) and the development of employee organisation relationships. Desk research introduces the research questions. Data for the research questions were gathered through a self-completion questionnaire distributed in a hardcopy form to the sample. Findings-An individual's level of scepticism and involvement appears to affect the development of a positive effect on employees' WOM. Involvement with the domain of the investment may be a central factor affecting relationship building within the organization, and upon generation of positive WOM. Practical implications-The chapter offers a conceptual framework to public relations (PR) and corporate communications practitioners, which may enrich their views and understanding of the use and value of CSR for communication strategies and practices. Social implications-For-profit organisations are major institutions in today's society. CSR is proffered as presenting advantages for (at macro level) society and (micro level) the organization and its employees. Originality/value of chapter-Concepts, such as involvement and scepticism, which have not been rigorously examined in PR and corporate communication literature, are addressed. By examining employee perceptions, managers and academic researchers gain insights into the acceptance, appreciation and effectiveness of CSR policies and activities upon the employee stakeholder group. This will affect current and future CSR communication strategies. The knowledge acquired from this chapter may be transferable outside the for-profit sector.

Previous research found that it is not easy to identify green consumers by using traditional demographic or psychographic measurements due to the instability of moral attitude and actual behavior. The frontal theta brain waves of 19 right-handed respondents were recorded and analyzed in a choice task between an environment-friendly (green) product and a conventional product. Product information, which was provided to the respondents, included written descriptions as well as the price of each product without visual depiction. Based on the respondents' choice, they were classified into two groups: green (GR) consumers who chose an environment-friendly product option and non-green (Non-GR) consumers who chose the option of a conventional product. While processing the green product message, we discovered that frontal theta activations were significantly higher among GR consumers than Non-GR consumers. On the contrary, the frontal theta waves of GR consumers were not differentiated from Non-GR consumers while processing the price information. Therefore, theta activations in the frontal area may potentially be a unique neural indicator of GR consumers' cognitive engagement with environment-friendly product messages. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Advertising; Corporate social responsibility; Electroencephalography; Frontal lobe; Green consumers; Neuromarketing",,"Suh, M.; Department of Biological Science, College of Science, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea; email: minahsuh@skku.edu",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Methodology/approach-On a general level, informativity denotes a set of universal principles for information qualities. In order to make informed assessments, information ought to provide readers with information on specific projects, outcome, and long-term impact. The model proposed herein allows researchers and practitioners to quantify corporate environmental information based on a set of key textual variables. By allowing for the quantification of qualitative information, the model allows for comparative studies of CSR communication across, for example, companies, sectors, and nations. Research implications-The model is applicable for corporations with an interest to evaluate their performance by applying standardized and set principles. Practical implications-The model can be used as a tool for consumers and investors alike in making better and more informed assessments about a corporation's environmental initiatives and performances.

Interviews with experts from 35 different Canadian corporations that produce a sustainability report were held to address this issue. The interviews specifically focused on exploring how public policy influences sustainability reporting, investigating how corporate sustainability reporting influences public policy, and identifying the barriers to linking sustainability reporting with public policy. The majority of participants explained that their corporation's sustainability reporting has not been heavily influenced by public policy. Even in the relatively few cases where the participating corporations were required to report on sustainability-related information (i.e. financial and insurance companies), there was little indication that public policy was strongly considered in reporting. Although several participants felt that their sustainability reports could or should influence public policy, there were also indications that corporations are looking for additional guidance on reporting from government. In fact, the lack of direction from government was cited as a key barrier to improved linkages between corporate sustainability reporting and public policy. Future research should focus on addressing this problem, particularly at the individual sector level. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Business; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Public policy; Reporting; Sustainability",,"Searcy, C.; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Canada",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",15353958,,,,"English","Corp.

They have a long history, and an evolving and interesting future. The case of China is perhaps particularly significant, as the co-operatives there are operating still within the context of state control, and it is not clear how they might develop in the future. Were China to decide that the co-operative and mutual corporate form had an important role to play alongside state, personal and shareholder-ownership models, then given the significant role of China in the global economy, this could have a major impact on the type of corporate diversity the world's economy enjoys in future years. These ‘alternative’ corporate forms include consumer co-operatives and producer co-operatives, as well as financial mutuals and employee ownership.

Methodology-We review the literature on communicating CSR to consumers through (1) messages constructed and verified by the company (such as product claims and corporate advertising), (2) messages constructed by the company, but verified by a third party (such as disclosures), and (3) messages constructed and verified by a third party (such as independent consumer guides and publicity). Findings-Communication messages constructed and verified by the company can be quite effective in persuading consumers, if they are communicated in a credible way. The latter can, for example, be done by including specific behaviors and/or outcomes in the message. Messages constructed by the firm, but verified by a third party tend to have a higher credibility, but risk containing either too little information or too much. Finally, messages constructed and verified by a third party can be seen as highly credible, but can sometimes be seen as merely PR. In addition, both messages focusing on deontological responsibility (the firm's motives and behavior), and messages focusing on consequentialist responsibility (the outcomes of the firm's behavior) seem important to consumers.

This question is relevant after more than 20 years of privatization of the public administration's bureaucracy and its adoption of management styles, behaviours and thinking from the private business sphere. This paper seeks to critically examine how water companies take part in the CSR discourse, by which institutional mechanisms this managerial ""thinking"" in terms of institutional ""logics"" has come about, and which adopted ""meanings"" lie behind. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper shows a qualitatively, ethnographic investigation and discourse analysis of privatized water companies from four different political and market economy nations; small- and medium-sized water companies from the social-democratic state of Denmark; large size companies from the conservative and liberal market economy of the UK; large- and multinational companies from the USA and medium-, large- and multinationals from South Africa. Seven companies are chosen in each country from the smallest to the largest in order to obtain maximum variety and express analytical generalizations across nations and company sizes if possible. Findings - The findings of the cross-geographical, -political, -market economical study of maximum variety of companies show how institutional logics are transferring from ""implicit"" CSR towards ""explicit"" CSR through coercive, normative and mimetic isomorphism: companies that are only engaged in coercive isomorphic ""implicit"" CSR show a hesitant and resistant engagement, whereas companies engaging in normative and mimetic isomorphic ""explicit"" CSR translate their discourses in a more authentic way. However, the findings also question the credibility of this authenticity when most CSR-reports from the water companies are made without third party accreditation, without performance indicators and only through narratives that are hard to scrutinize. Research limitations/implications - The research has limitations towards the discourse analysis, which in Denmark was possible to conduct from both oral texts such as interviews, observation studies and document analysis, whereas in the UK, the USA and South Africa is based only on written texts from documents, CSR-reports, annual reports and written communications between regulators and companies. The research implications suggest a further replication of the findings from a more in-depth analysis of the institutional logics in these companies in the UK, the USA and South Africa by replication of the study from Denmark. Practical implications - The practical implications of this study suggest a transformation of political instrumentation from rule-setting to incentives making to make public water service companies even more engaged in ""explicit"" CSR to obtain more authenticity and a higher level of legitimacy in the field compared to the strong tradition of ""explicit"" CSR seen in the private business sphere. Originality/value - The originality and value of this research is shown by the empirical findings of the theoretical suggestions by Matten and Moon in how ""implicit"" CSR is transferred to ""explicit"" CSR in the privatization of public service companies in the water sector across nations, cultures, political and market economical spheres. It shows through the discourse analysis of institutional logics how institutional isomorphism is prevalent in this sector and how New Public Management systems need to conform from instrumental rule-making to incentive-making to make public service adopt CSR in a more authentic way.

Methodology/approach - The analysis synthesizes the findings of a review of 20 such initiatives. It draws on a wide body of literatures and conceptual insights to understand the emergence of these new approaches to international business regulation. The assessment of their emergence, performance, and impacts highlights the complex dynamics of regulatory change. Findings - The findings caution against simple generalizations about the positive or negative outcomes of these new forms of collaborative governance. Their somewhat mixed record can be partly explained by the diverse set of interests, preferences, and agendas of the actors involved; variations in institutional learning, capacities, and power relations; as well as how such initiatives are nested in broader institutions and structures. This points to the need, raised in the conclusion, for intellectual pluralism in advancing knowledge of the effectiveness of new regulatory institutions. Originality and value - The analysis aims to go beyond studies that (i) tend to focus on just one or a few cases; (ii) that ignore the implications of such initiatives for development in the Global South; and (iii) draw on narrow bodies of theory and literature to understand complex issues.

I consider why whistleblowers are seen as unsettling and ambivalent figures by exploring the analogy between Antigone, the Sophoclean heroine, and whistleblowers. These reflections reconfigure the rationality and relationality of the process of whistleblowing. The rationality of the whistleblower is singular and not easily subsumed into universalizing norms which explains some of the limits reached by the empiricist pro-social research agenda. The relationality of the process of whistleblowing indicates that the reactions of those who hear the whistle are as important.

We suggest that sustainable HRM is a next, innovative and promising domain for theory building, research and practice in the field of HRM. It nonetheless poses several new challenges. To date, the literature on this topic is inconsistent, and the field therefore lacks clear lines, fine-tuning and conceptual/practical maturity. In this context, the 'Respect Openness Continuity (ROC)'-model is introduced. This model proceeds from the proposition that sustainable HRM forms a subsequent stage in the tradition of HRM thinking. In recent years, mainstream HRM has been strongly identified with strategic HRM thinking. In developing a model for sustainable HRM, various theoretical viewpoints beyond the strategic HRM tradition are explored and assessed for their potential contributions to a framework for sustainable HRM that can bridge theory and practice. © Rainer Hampp Verlag.","Corporate social responsibility; Critical HRM; Ethics; Institutional theory; Paradox lens; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable HRM",,"De Prins, P.; Antwerp Management School, Sint Jacobsmarkt 9-13, Belgium",,"Rainer Hampp Verlag",09359915,,,,"English","Manag.

In striving for legitimacy, MNCs increasingly engage in dialogue processes with their stakeholders. However, the era of globalization and the parallel rise of the Internet and the new ""Web 2.0"" have dramatically widened the range of options for such dialogue processes. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in particular make use of ""social media"" (e.g., Facebook, Weblogs, Twitter) which enable them to quickly generate attention regarding socially and environmentally harmful business practices by MNCs. In response, MNCs have started applying social media technologies for corporate communication purposes. However, given the novelty of these activities, we lack knowledge on how these organizations make use of social media. Therefore, in this chapter, we examine how MNCs and NGOs utilize one particular social media application, that is, Twitter, for dialogic stakeholder communication. Design/methodology/approach-In our empirical study, we examine current practices of Twitter usage by MNCs and NGOs. We investigate a dataset of more than 3,000 Twitter articles from 30 MNCs and 30 NGOs in the German-speaking world. Our analysis is based on the ""conceptual orality or literality"" scale by Koch and Oesterreicher (1994). Findings-The comparative analysis shows that on average MNCs and NGOs exhibit a surprisingly similar profile on Twitter. Both tend toward conceptual literality. However, the analysis of Tweets per organization reveals a much larger variance. At the extreme poles, while some NGOs (like Greenpeace Youth) make extensive use of the medium's potential for conceptual orality, some MNCs (like Deutsche Borse) almost entirely adhere to conceptual literality. In other words, these MNCs promote a classical one-way model of communication and fail to make use of the dialogue-like qualities of the medium. Research limitations-We analyzed a small number of organizations and we restricted our study to MNCs and NGOs in the German-speaking world. Furthermore, Twitter only allows for short messages with a maximum of 140 letters or signs. This, in turn, renders questionable whether the medium is suited to establish deliberative dialogues between MNCs and NGOs that are based on more elaborate arguments which can be expressed in the short format. Originality/value-Our study addresses the lack of research regarding new possibilities for stakeholder communication in the age of social media. Moreover, the study methodologically contributes to the study of social media in the context of corporate communication by applying the scale of ""conceptual orality or literality"" to MNCs' and NGOs' Twitter usage.

Design/methodology/approach – A corpus of 27 CEO Statements was analyzed using Fairclough’s three-dimensional critical discourse analysis (CDA) model, which proposes analyzing text, discourse practice and social practice. The analysis emphasized image and language features in text while it explored intertextuality in discourse practice and ideology in social practice. Findings – The analysis revealed that selected image and language features contribute to six themes about CSR, namely achievement, identification, aspiration, disclosure, recognition and appreciation. The analysis also revealed that policies, standards and studies are often cited to reduce a credibility gap. These analyses indicate that CEO Statements represent CSR as a corporation’s philanthropic initiatives for stakeholders. This representation reflects the ideology of CEO Statements. It establishes corporations as an agent of positive change in society, which helps to improve the social legitimacy of corporations. Research limitations/implications – Since the corpus was limited to ten corporations in three years, the findings might not be representative of the genre of CEO Statements. The corpus could be extended to include CEO Statements from other years, countries and languages and it can launch a productive enterprise in intercultural studies. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates CDA as an approach to understand CEO Statements. It may be useful to people practicing and teaching corporate communication because it encourages them to consider the meaning implied by image and language features, which can influence the meaning of CEO Statements. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CDA; CEO statements; Corporate social responsibility; CSR communication; Image; Language",,"Rajandran, K.; School of Humanities, Universiti Sains MalaysiaMalaysia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13563289,,,,"English","Corp.

While some industry participants have responded through adherence to best practice, little information or support is available about how to responsibly market volunteer tourism. This research uses an online content analysis based on the International Voluntourism Guidelines for Commercial Operators to understand the use of responsibility as a market signalling tool. Five influential web pages of eight organisations are scored across 19 responsibility criteria and compared against the organisation's legal status, product type and price. We find that responsibility is not used for market signalling; preference is given to communicating what is easy, and not what is important. The status of the organisation is no guarantee of responsible practice, and price and responsibility communications display an inverse relationship. We conclude volunteer tourism operators are overpositioning and communicating responsibility inconsistently, which highlights greenwashing, requiring at least industry-wide codes of practice, and at best, regulation.

The findings suggest that when customers are making a decision for the distant future (e.g., three months later), they are more likely to engage in abstract thinking and rely on metacognitive cues such as processing fluency. As such, a CSR message with high processing fluency will be preferred. On contrary, when customers are making a decision for the near future (e.g., next week), their information processing strategies are influenced by their concrete mental representation of the events.

Hence, we explore the management of CSR strategies by MNE subsidiaries with specific interest on their proactive adoption of strategic CSR to obtain legitimacy in a foreign host country. Drawing on the recent CSR literature and related theories, including stakeholder theory and institutional theory, propositions and a conceptual framework are developed and presented. The framework integrates BE and IB concepts on the different dimensions of CSR and provides a theoretical derived explanation of the process for strategic adoption of global through to more local CSR strategies by MNE subsidiaries to build legitimacy in an emerging market context. In addition, the framework provides valuable insights into the adoption of different ethical approaches or CSR strategies based on the level of ethical pressure in a host country and the degree of CSR ingrainedness in the parent company. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Global versus local CSR; Institutional theory; Legitimacy; Multinational enterprises; Stakeholder theory",,"Freeman, S.; International Business Discipline, Adelaide Business School, The University of Adelaide, 10 Pulteney Street, Adelaide, SA, 5005, Australia; email: susan.freeman@adelaide.edu.au",,"Springer Netherlands",01674544,,,,"English","J.

First, the authors aim to identify all the product- and brand-related factors that promote cause-related marketing (CRM) success. The second part of this research aim is, to undertake a product innovation theory application into the context of CRM, examine the degree and nature of its theoretical and practical consonance, and develop an integrated conceptual framework for CRM success. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual and incorporates and interrelates the findings of existing CRM research as applied within the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Specifically this paper accumulates the state of prior wisdom on CRM success through the identification of several product- and brand-related success factors, based on a systematic review of the literature. In doing so, it introduces the concept of product innovation as a CRM success factor and integrates those distinct fields into a conceptual framework. Findings: The authors develop an integrative framework and a propositional inventory that represents a consolidated foundation for the systematic development of a theory for successful CRM strategies, along with the integration of product innovation within the field of CRM. Research limitations/implications: Towards this direction, the objective of this study is theory construction rather than theory testing. Thus, much work remains to be done in terms of empirically testing our research propositions. In conclusion, this paper posits a set of research directions designed to enable scholars to further advance the integration of product innovation and CRM from both problem-driven theory development as well as theory-driven practice management perspectives. Originality/value: The value of this paper accumulates the state of prior wisdom on CRM success, a notion with increasing use by corporations in recent years. Furthermore, this paper appears to be the first of its kind to examine, from the theorist perspective, the dynamics implied by synthesizing these, so far, distinct concepts. Additionally, the research adds appreciable value to academic knowledge on the fundamental discussion of the bidirectional relationship between CSR and innovation, also contributing an analogous CRM success framework to the existing wisdom. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cause-related marketing; Corporate social responsibility; Product innovation; Success factors",,"Christofi, M.; School of Business and Management, University of Gloucestershire, Cheltenham, United Kingdom; email: michael_chr@live.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02634503,,,,"English","Mark.

The mediating effect of brand preference between perceived CSR initiatives and customer loyalty is also examined. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology in the current study involves the use of questionnaire surveys delivered to a convenience sample in the city of Macau in 2012. A total of 616 valid samples were collected among casino players in a high bet limit area in six major casinos. Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses formulated for carrying the study forward. Findings – The findings indicated that customers’ brand preference can be enhanced by their perceptions on CSR. Two CSR initiatives (stakeholders and society) significantly increase loyalty intention, although to varying degrees. The impact of CSR on stakeholders has a stronger influence on customers’ brand preference. Another important finding of the current study is the fact that brand preference is a partial mediator of perceived CSR initiatives and customer loyalty. Research limitations/implications – This study verified the relationship among CSR initiatives perception, brand preference and loyalty intention in the context of the Macau gaming industry. Perceived CSR initiatives enhance customer loyalty. Additionally, this study found a partial mediating effect of brand preference between CSR perception and customer loyalty. Practical implications – Customer loyalty can be enhanced with companies’ appropriate investments in social responsibilities. Although a socially responsible brand image of a company is not guaranteed to be a competitive advantage that attracts more premium customers, there is a general consensus that it may result in the latter with appropriate CSR strategies involving the greatest attention directed toward improving stakeholders’ interests. From the marketing perspective, retaining premium customers with a higher brand preference level is a key to both long-term competitiveness and profitability. Originality/value – This study investigates how premium customers’ perceived CSR initiatives of a casino influence their loyalty intention, and also examines how brand preference, as a mediator, influences the relationship between perceived CSR and loyalty intention. Extending the realm of CSR study to understand the linkage between CSR and customer behaviors is also important because multiple theories predict different benefits, and assessing the value of CSR, therefore, requires multiple approaches. Finally, evidence from the research is significant for researchers and practitioners, especially when working on conflicting issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand preference; Branding; Casinos; Consumer behavior; Corporate social responsibility; CSR initiatives; Customer loyalty; Macau; Premium customers; Relationship marketing; Responsibility; Service industry",,"Rongwei, C.; Fudan UniversityChina",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09596119,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach: Conducted using a series of site visits and interviews with managers working within the licensed trade, this was followed up with structured interviews of ""front line"" staff. Findings: Despite high levels of awareness of both the social problems relating to alcohol consumption and the legislative changes, engagement with operational CSR was limited and often disinterested. Legal and societal expectations regarding drunkenness are of little concern. Research limitations/implications: This paper is concerned with nascent legislation, the full impact and success of which has not yet emerged. Reviewing this study in five years would add to the strength of the results. Limited to Scotland due to its devolved licensing laws, however, it clearly highlights lack of employee engagement with CSR. Practical implications: Despite placing CSR issues at the forefront of day to day operations within the licensed trade there is little empirical evidence around customer facing staff engagement.

The authors primarily focus on one facet of CSR strategy – cause-related marketing (CRM) – which has been increasingly used by marketing practitioners in recent times.Design/methodology/approach– In the context of Egyptian household goods business, the authors investigate the factors that motivate/hinder consumer participation in their CRM campaigns using a sample of 261 respondents in a mixed research design.Findings– Results show that motivational attribution significantly predicts consumers’ responses toward CRM, with moral judgment playing a partial mediating role in such relationship. In addition, several variables such as altruism and religiosity among personality characteristics are found to arouse consumers’ positive motivational attribution, whereas skepticism was negatively associated with CRM responses.Practical implications– The findings of this research have both practical and social implications for academics and practitioners alike. Successful campaigns should include the factors inducing motivational attribution, which, in turn, enhances consumers’ attitude toward a company and their purchase intentions. Personal characteristics also impact consumer responses and should be paid attention to.Originality/value– In a world characterized by fast-changing pace of globalization, it has become critical to study an important phenomenon like CRM in the Middle East, and this original research provides insights into how effective CRM campaigns can be developed there.

This progress continues to be hampered, however, by the ability of a multinational corporation (MNC) that violates human rights not only to shift liability from itself to a nation-state but even to win compensation from that nation-state for loss of profits due to restrictions on its business activities. In the process, the nation-state’s sovereignty is diminishing; and, in effect, though still attributed to nation-states, it is being transferred to the MNC. The main aim of this article is (1) to draw on normative considerations to claim that this MNC proto-sovereignty should be modified and (2) to contend that this can eventually be accomplished by adding to corporate adoption of CSR guidelines a regimen of global human rights enforcement. I base this contention on expectations about the internationalization of corporate criminal law and the globalization of civil society in general and of NGOs in particular.

In part, they pertain to Wal-Mart’s global strategy of growth and expansion, where the company’s senior managers have been implicated in using illegal bribery and corruption to secure business and to conceal this information from regulatory authorities. Another issue, albeit longer running, has been the incidents of fire and resulting deaths and injuries of hundreds of people, most notably in Bangladesh, but also in other countries where low-skill, low-wage manufacturing predominates, and where foreign multinationals have been accused of condoning and profiting from sweatshop-like exploitation of workers. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use Wal-Mart as a microcosm of corporate conduct which provides a prism through which to examine the exploitation of negative externalities, i.e. engaging in illegal and unethical behavior by using their bargaining power and market control these companies, pressure host countries to condone environmental degradation, violation of country laws in terms of wages, working conditions and operating in sweatshop-like conditions to maximize their profits at the expense of other factors of production, i.e. labor and resources. Findings – The authors contend that Wal-Mart’s unique business model, which focuses on everyday low price, absolute growth and market share expansion by any means possible and everyday low cost, has led to the company’s enormous success since its founding and has made it one of the world’s largest corporations by revenue. At the same time, this model seriously impedes the company’s ability to improve unit-based profit margins and thus forces it to take short cuts in achieving lateral growth and low-cost production. Social implications – The authors also examine in some detail the large gap that exists between Wal-Mart’s pronouncements of the company’s commitment to ethical and socially responsible conduct and its actual business practices. They demonstrate that the company’s communications and claims for ethical conduct are mostly aspirational and fail the test of accuracy, specificity, materiality and verifiability through independent, externally provided integrity assurance. Originality/value – Finally, the authors outline a number of measures that would need to be taken by Wal-Mart, industry groups that depend heavily on outsourcing from low-skill, low-wage countries for their products and host country governments and the governments of Western industrialized nations whose corporations and consumers are the primary beneficiaries of the exploitative sweatshops that fatten their companies’ bottom lines and enrich their denizens with ample amounts of inexpensive goods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Bangladesh; Bribery and corruption; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility and accountability; Multinational corporations; Wal-Mart",,"Sethi, P.; Baruch College, The City University of New YorkUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

Design/methodology/ approach - Based on a content analysis of 58 corporate reports and three interviews with senior managers from Chinese-Western joint ventures, the authors analyzed the environmentally-related CSR adoption strategies and the effects of global competition and cooperation in Chinese state oil companies. Findings - The findings suggest that more cooperative CSR strategies related to environment protection have been adopted by Chinese state oil companies in the past decade. The main reasons are: the force of international and local environmental regulations; the pressures from partners of western oil companies and the desire to increase the global competitive advantage of the Chinese state oil companies.

By understanding whistle-blowing systems as an instrument that is desired by society, the legitimacy theory could be transferred to the whistle-blowing concept. A survey of German managers shows that legitimacy theory may be supported. Further insights into legitimacy theory are given by the motivation for the design of the implemented systems. The survey shows that, in particular, the implementation of external whistle-blowing systems is seemingly not driven by desired effectiveness. This supports legitimacy theory, since it reveals that external systems are symbolic rather than substantive systems. However, the results do not hold for internal whistle-blowing systems because the implementation of internal systems is ostensibly driven by power theories. The results are interesting for the planned statutory whistleblower protection as they reveal a partially restrained attitude toward whistle-blowing. Whistle-blowing systems are not effective if management is not convinced of their benefits. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Effectiveness; Legitimacy theory; Power theory; Whistle-blowing; Whistle-blowing systems",,"Pittroff, E.; Institute of Accounting, Finance and Taxation, University of Leipzig, Grimmaische Str. 12, Germany",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

This is especially true in the developing parts of the world. Numerous initiatives, guidelines and tools have been made available for CSR practice but very little is known about the usefulness of the new CSR-standard International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 26000. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was designed to explore how a mining and construction company, located in the Zambian Copperbelt, practices CSR within the health area and to discuss the possible merits of ISO 26000 for CSR development in the mining industry in the developing world. Findings: Our findings show that, despite the fact that ISO 26000 is primarily a series of guidelines, it can be used to evaluate and improve a company's CSR practice even if that company is already considered as a frontrunner within CSR. The standard can give valuable advice when designing community development programs and allocating the use of charity donations. Further, our study has shown that traditional management systems based on occupational health and safety standard 18001 and ISO 14001 can rather effectively support actions and expectations in ISO 26000. Research limitations/implications: The research context is Zambia, so there might be limitations when applying the results to other cultural and geographical settings. Practical implications: The paper is a useful source of information about the practical implementation of CSR within the health area.

Concept of CSR is defined by the European Commission (2002, p. 5) and remembered by Steurer et al. (2005), CSR as “a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis”. Many authors have debated the different possibilities of simultaneously incorporating social, environmental and economic concerns into management thinking and practice (Aguilera et al. (2007) in organizational behavior; Buysse and Verbeke (2003); Starkey and Crane (2003); Barin-Cruz et al. (2006) in strategic management; Hall and Martin (2005) in technological innovations). All those scholars have been developing concept of CSR from different point of view. This paper work concerns value creation through CSR only as economical category. But therefore in order to indicate areas of possible value creation, various all above mentioned aspects of CSR concept are analyzed. The review of theoretical and empiric researches showed that value created through CSR for the company might emerge as a part of any of the following benefits: financial benefits, better quality, marketing benefits, better organizational culture, effectiveness doing business globally. This paperwork suggests a framework of value creation through CSR, considering CSR implementation might help to create shared value for few beneficiaries. The framework consists of all four types of responsibilities described by Carroll (1999), three major groups of beneficiaries (company, society, stakeholders) and areas of possible value creation. But, as theoretical research shows, this framework first should be adopted for value creation chain (VCC) before analyzing value creation through CSR possibilities in whole VCC Considering specifics of CSR implementation in VCC the framework of evaluating value creation is suggested. The framework consists of seven stages which should be used as guidelines for program of empiric research. Further studies should concentrate attention on shared value creation through CSR in VCC where in every stage company is one of the beneficiaries. Measuring such value might be extremely difficult, because value received by stakeholders and society appear as use value quite often. © 2013, Inzinerine Ekonomika-Engineering Economics.

Most of the studies have focused on external stakeholder pressures. The aim of this chapter is to extend this line of inquiry by theorizing that the dynamics among internal stakeholders also shapes CSR conduct. Design/methodology/approach - This theoretical contribution borrows from research on socially responsible indices, behavioral corporate governance theory in CSR and from recent research that has leveraged attribution theory to better understand reactions to corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR). Findings - Our chapter proposes that firms adhering to substantive CSR practice are less likely to be punished by external stakeholders than otherwise. From an internal stakeholder viewpoint, it suggests there is a positive relationship between the number of board ties to reputable universities/nonprofit organizations and substantive CSR practices; and a negative relationship between managerial discretion and substantive CSR practices. Social implications - This chapter can have social applicability as it deals with stakeholders' role in pressuring the modern organization to engage in substantive CSR. Originality/value - As aforementioned, most studies explore the relationship between CSR compliance and external stakeholder pressures. In contrast, the relationship between internal stakeholder dynamics and CSR compliances is still not well understood. Hence, the incorporating of these dynamics provides theoretical insights for the CSR, sustainability, and corporate governance arenas.

Methodology/approach - It presents the results of two case studies, from different perspectives, whose results strengthen and complement each other. Both studies use interviews as their main source of data within triangulation, and both adopt iterative processes for their analyses: one uses data coding, the other takes a narrative approach. Findings - The findings suggest that whilst companies see both costs and opportunities in environmental regulations, this is not perceived by their policy-making counterparts. Furthermore, company-internal communication suggests that lobbying and corporate social responsibility (CSR) are not joined up, which leads to mixed (external) messages sent from the company to policy-makers and the public. Research limitations - The chapter focuses on one industry (automobiles) in one host country setting (EU). Practical implications - Policy-makers, as well as companies that want to contribute to sustainability, could usefully adopt the concept of internalising external costs as a minimum proxy for sustainability. Companies that wish to promote sustainable development, or even wish to act in a consistent manner, might usefully examine their assumptions about the political process. This is particularly the case with MNEs as they operate in numerous jurisdictions. Originality/value - The chapter integrates the MNE literature and the literature on international business (IB)-government interactions. The findings underline the importance of addressing both environmental issues and the relationships between policy-makers and MNEs, an area that can be further developed by extending the scope of the study to other industries in further research.

The study also reveals how these evaluations relate to purchase intention.

The HIV/AIDS intervention management practices of 12 construction firms in Cape Town are examined through interviews and documents. From thematic analysis, five themes emerged: construction firms' perceptions of HIV/AIDS as a threat to the firm; construction firm interventions; barriers to the success of interventions; the role of service providers; and state-led interventions. A tension exists in managing HIV/AIDS interventions as firms are concerned with productivity and profit maximization, but are becoming more engaged with corporate social responsibility and a higher duty of care towards employees. Interventions should extend beyond awareness and prevention campaigns to include testing and treatment programmes. A guideline checklist for such interventions is proposed. Partnering with specialized service providers is recommended, as well as engaging closely with public sector services. Firms successfully managing their HIV/AIDS response should share their experience with others struggling to respond. Employee issues of stigma and reluctance to disclose need to be addressed.

This chapter examines the incorporation of CSR in the core brand discourse of Marks & Spencer (M&S), focusing on the interrelationship between CSR reporting and brand heritage. Design/methodology/approach-Using Fairclough's (1989) method of critical discourse analysis, this chapter reports on the key discourses around CSR to emerge from annual reports of M&S in the period from the 1940s to 2010s.Findings-Findings identify how messages relating to CSR are shaped and presented to stakeholders, noting the textual patterns that emerge in the M&S discourse. Patterns included a substantial reliance on relational values, the strategic adoption of expressive values toward specific groups (employees, suppliers), and textual cues such as metaphor and overwording as a means to draw out links to M&S brand heritage. Research implications-The chapter highlights how we, as academics, need to consider both (a) the evolution of CSR reporting and how this reflects brand messages over time and (b) how CSR reporting is becoming integral in brand positioning for UK retailer brands. Practical limitations-In dealing with archival materials, it is necessary to be selective and this can limit the range of textual patterns that might be articulated in the discourse analysis. Originality/value-Limited research to date has examined the integration of CSR and brand heritage in organizational discourses. This study offers an in-depth examination of how this integration of CSR messages in brand communication has evolved for M&S-one of the United Kingdom's foremost retail brands.

To capture the distinct nature of this global focus, researchers have developed a three-generation CSR typology. In this paper, we first evaluate the usefulness of this typology for understanding corporate approaches to CSR by examining how several companies position themselves thematically in CEO introductions to sustainability reports. On the basis of this, we then evaluate the practical value of this typology for assisting those who work with CSR strategy. The analysis revealed expressions of all three CSR generations, with third-generation thinking being apparent, but not dominant. It also verified that the three-generation CSR typology can be an instructive means of both evaluating as well as framing a company's approach to sustainability, though with modifications. On the basis of the identified strengths and weaknesses of the typology, we develop a practitioner-focused, three-tiered model that can strategically guide the development of CSR programs. © 2014 The Authors.

This commentary builds upon this notion by highlighting the need to explicitly examine SEW conflict, as well as offering initial theorizing on how family firms will pursue SEW preservation in these situations. Drawing on image theory, we theorize a process where preserving internal SEW is generally used as the guiding script in family firms because it is more salient on an everyday basis. However, we propose that if its preservation threatens the organization's identity and reputation, the script will be disrupted, precipitating a shift to preserving external SEW.

In addition, the role of moral elevation as a mediating variable in such relationships is tested. Design/methodology/approach: After an exploratory study, the authors tested the role of moral elevation as a mediator that facilitates the effects of company CSR activities in social domains on two specific types of pro-social behavior displayed by consumers: donating money and volunteering time for the same cause sponsored by the company. The authors conducted two quantitative studies to test their hypotheses. In Study 1, they considered the two pro-social behaviors as intentions; in Study 2, they analyzed them as actual behaviors. In both studies, the authors conducted controlled experiments administered in the field. By using experimental and control conditions, they were able to manipulate corporate responsible actions in social contexts, and a mediational analysis was conducted. Findings: The authors results show that moral elevation mediates the positive relationship between the CSR activity and consumer intention to donate (actual consumer donating behavior) to social causes, and the CSR activity and volunteering intention (actual volunteering behavior). Originality/value: This paper contributes to furthering CSR theory by showing the positive effects of company CSR initiatives on two pro-social ""secondary"" outcomes and the mediating role played by moral elevation.

Among the Middle East countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) tops the list in terms of per capita energy spending and per capita carbon footprints. The construction industry is the major contributor to environmental pollution due to its size and nature of activity. The rapid growth of construction sector has a significant environmental impact with increase in carbon footprints. This paper analyses the environmental implications of the rapidly growing construction industry in UAE using system dynamics approach. Quantitative modelling of the construction industry supply chain helps to measure the dynamic interaction between its various factors under multiple realistic scenarios. The potential carbon savings and the impact of each factor are calculated using scenario development analysis. The paper has addressed in detail the various drivers and inhibitors of carbon emission in the construction industry supply chain and ways to evaluate the carbon savings.

Many stakeholders expect CSR to exhibit clarity, consistency, and discursive closure. But stakeholders also expect CSR to conform to varying degrees of both formal and substantive rationality. These diverse expectations conflict with each other and change over time. A content analysis of press coverage in Denmark suggests that the business media reflect and amplify the ambiguity generated by these shifting demands. We propose that this very public lack of discursive closure provides strategic advantages to CSR stakeholders by rendering the concept of CSR adaptable, resilient, and meaningful to diverse interests. From this perspective, strategic ambiguity emerges from a relational and mediated process, not from the direct intentions of individual stakeholders. Our framework suggests that CSR is best understood not as a clear or consistent agenda, but rather as a forum for sensemaking, diversity of opinion, and debate over the conflicting social norms and expectations attached to corporate activity. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CSR; Discursive closure; Mediation; Stakeholders; Strategic ambiguity; The business press",,"Morsing, M.; Copenhagen Business School, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; email: mm.ikl@cbs.dk",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Contrary to that the chapter argues that CSR communication strategies need to take the genesis and drivers of CSR institutionalization into account. Methodology/approach-The chapter develops a complex set of interrelated drivers for CSR institutionalization from a literature review-among them leadership styles and management fashion. The chapter further discusses the influence of leadership styles and management fashions on CSR institutionalization and focuses on the diffusion of management concepts along a management fashion cycle. It then refers to executive trainers as the key facilitator and promoter of new business concepts and presents data from a first online-survey among German speaking management trainers. Findings-The chapter clears manager's role in institutionalization of CSR by contextualizing their behavior in a portfolio of performance indicators. From a management fashion perspective the various forms of explicit and implicit CSR are linked to management styles. Practical implications-The chapter lays ground for further research of CSR institutionalization and integration into business strategy by providing a conceptualization of CSR drivers and settings that relate to a given organization. As such it is designed as groundwork for a yet to develop CSR scorecard.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors realized a questionnaire survey that asked Canadian companies why they do or do not issue standalone CSR reports, what their motivations and costs are, and the extent to which they comply with GRI guidelines. Findings: The results show that larger firms issue standalone CSR reports. As larger firms have more political visibility and are subject to greater external scrutiny than smaller firms (Watts and Zimmerman, 1986), the findings indicate that firms primarily issue standalone CSR reports in response to external scrutiny by stakeholders, which is consistent with a stakeholder perspective. The survey also identifies that ancillary motivations for Canadian firms for issuing standalone CSR reports are consistent with legitimacy and signalling perspectives. Research limitations/implications: The authors acknowledge that the generalizability of the findings is limited due to the sample being situated within a single national context. The inferences drawn from such a sample in Canada may not be applicable to other countries with different national institutional contexts. In addition, the small size of the sample may limit the generalizability of the findings. The authors also did not specifically consider the quality of the CSR reports in the study.

Five models are tested over a common 17 years horizon. They yield consistent significant estimates and concur on the existence of such a relationship although the latter has evolved over time. They support the notion of a complex SP-FP impact. © 2014, Internationala Journal of Business Science and Applied Management.

Methodology/approach-Qualitative approach including focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Case studies of three regional Australian and Canadian communities at different stages of community development. Findings-Communication, both traditional and in new media forms such as social media, was important to social capital development provided that it was diverse, appropriate to community needs and extended its reach to community members to include those who were marginalised. Access and skill issues affected some community members' engagement when they attempted to use social media, although the increasing use of social media as a connector was observed. These findings have implications for organisations' CSR, as organisations can be responsive to their communities if they also communicate and engage with them for mutual benefit. Research limitations/implications-A pilot, exploratory study that highlighted the varied context of community social capital and the diversity of communication that engages and includes community members; ongoing research is in progress to gain understanding of regional communities' connections and networks, and how to strengthen them and how stakeholders are identified and supported. Practical implications-The study indicated that it is important to explore all communication avenues and extend the reach and participation of community communication through diverse channels including social media. The research provided some good examples where organisations support and encourage community social capital development-this underpins the success of other programmes such as CSR programmes. Social implications-To develop sound networks and relationships where organisations and their communities develop trust, deal with issues and collaboratively problem solve. Social capital develops and supports other forms of capital-without it organisations may be too focused on 'doing good' rather than 'being good'. Originality/value-This chapter provides insight into communication layering and the context of social capital development for effective communication in regional communities. Social responsiveness is possible when organisations understand their community; this chapter puts forward the notion that organisations are members of their communities so that their social capital is important to all they do, including their planning and delivery of CSR programmes.

This headquartering effect casts doubt on earlier studies suggesting that the “transnational” or “glocal” model can effectively address the multitude of global and local CSR challenges modern multinational companies (MNCs) face. Design/methodology/approach – This conceptual paper uses a stakeholder lens, in turn, drawing from resource dependence theory and organizational legitimacy theory to develop under which conditions claims of Southern stakeholders will be considered by Northern MNCs. It provides evidence for the existence of a headquartering effect as a defning characteristic of mainstream CSR approaches. Findings – The authors argue that the increasing professionalization and dissemination of mainstream CSR approaches among MNCs reinforce the headquartering effect, with strategic decision-making increasingly confned to the companies’ headquarters, while the scope of action within the subsidiaries and the supply chain of MNCs becomes increasingly restricted over time. Ultimately, this headquartering effect strengthens a Northern CSR/sustainability agenda and fails to empower developing country stakeholders. Originality/value – The paper contributes by exploring how international CSR follows a different underlying rationale than international business. While international business research follows an instrumental perspective, international CSR is driven by both instrumental and normative considerations. Thus, international business theories may not be directly applicable to international CSR contexts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bartlett and Ghoshal typology; Headquartering effect; Integration – responsiveness framework; International CSR; Stakeholder salience",,"Barkemeyer, R.; School of Earth and Environment, University of LeedsUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17422043,,,,"English","Crit.

It mainly looks at the CSR movement in China in order to explain how the traditional values of Confucianism contributed to the development of CSR discourse which is similar to and differs from some other countries in North America and Europe.Design/methodology/approach: The chapter is primarily theoretical in perspective. It also adopts a discourse approach, specifically Fairclough's three-step approach by drawing upon a large state-owned corporate group's website documents and interview data in order to create new meanings of Chinese CSR shaped by Confucian moral philosophy.Findings: The chapter argues that development of Chinese CSR theory incorporates a revival of Confucian moral philosophy into modern Western business management philosophy. It demonstrates a hybrid model for CSR practices which combine aspects of both Confucian business ethics and Western CSR theory.Research limitations/implications: The research results are valid for state-owned enterprises and may not be generalized to other types of Chinese businesses such as private-owned enterprises and small business enterprises. Further research is needed to develop comparisons.Practical implications: The chapter suggests a people-oriented leadership style which emphasizes the importance of people in the organization and is proven to be successful in the improvement of employee well-being and organizational productivity.Originality/value: The originality of introducing interview data offers a benchmark for the study of CSR discourse in Chinese context. The chapter also provides a guide for business managers to design the strategies based on their own countries' cultural, political, social, and institutional framework.

They prioritize customers’ needs over other stakeholders’ (e.g. stockholders and community members) on FB. FB fans are more likely to post “like” when companies personalize their FB messages. Seeking specific action-oriented participation on FB increased the frequencies of “like” and “comment,” whereas using the generic terms like “try” or “learn” decreased such frequencies. Finally, the frequencies of fans posting “like” and “comment” are affected by how often companies responded to fans’ postings and not influenced by how often companies feed new FB updates to fans.Originality/value – This study provides a benchmark case of how corporations are using a mainstream social media outlet to engage different stakeholders.

Using an experimental design, sixteen scenarios were distributed to (1) 163 managers in Estonia, (2) 152 MBA students in India and 125 MBA students in France, and (3) 186 (non-traditional) undergraduate students in the USA. Results suggest that when top managers are attributed with the responsibility for downsizing, the resulting perceptions of CSR are negative. A similar pattern of results is obtained for victims’ perceptions of fairness and survivor commitment. In addition, although there are differences in effect-size based on differences in power distance, these results hold good (are similar) across the four countries, from four different society clusters.

Given the scope and ambition of this program, and the prestige of the United Nations associated with it, its supporters believe it will fundamentally reshape how businesses practice corporate social responsibility (CSR). Its critics view it as a flawed program because it does not impose verifiable obligations and does not compel its participants to adhere to their program obligations. We present an approach to study CSR programs grounded in rational-choice institutionalist theory, building on previous work viewing CSR programs as clubs which can produce reputational benefits for members as well as positive societal externalities, provided that they incorporate institutional mechanisms to prevent member shirking. This perspective puts the focus squarely on the institutional rules of the UNGC and their impacts on member behavior. While we conclude that the UNGC has not yet demonstrated a capacity to generate across-the-board improvements in CSR performance beyond what member firms would have done otherwise, we are hopeful that its sponsors and leaders can undertake worthwhile changes in program design to align member incentives with program objectives. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CSR clubs; Institutional design; Monitoring and enforcement; United Nations Global Compact",,"Berliner, D.; Department of Political Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; email: dberlinr@umn.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",01674544,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach – A new conceptual framework for experiential learning that draws on both scholarly and experimental learning. Using learner-centred learning, the approach aims to engage each student to act both as a learner and a mentor, thus empowering them into enhancing their own and the overall class’ learning experience. Findings – Applying the diversity of students’ individual cultural mindsets to analyse and critically evaluate some of the current most pressing organizational and national/international dilemmas in sustainability. The preliminary outcomes seem to indicate that this approach enriches the students’ learning experience and motivates them to become reflective practitioners and sustainability-focused leaders in their future organizational roles. Research limitations/implications – A framework for an empirical mapping of this important area of teaching and learning (T&L) aimed at a highly international body of undergraduate management students. This is currently under-represented in academic writing and practice, as most of the comparable situations so far mainly address post-graduate cases and do not reflect on the international diversity of the student body. Practical implications – This research reflects on the importance of embedding diverse views on the same issues based on different cultural and socio-economic perspectives, and therefore it brings value to the students’ experience in view of enhancing their global and international human relations awareness and negotiation skills in view of more meaningful sustainability-focused plans and actions. Social implications – Students become aware of differences in needs, resources, cultural perceptions, business standards, practices and policies in place in different countries, and they will be committed to embedding sustainability issues in their future life as business practitioners and will be able to ensure the most appropriate business responses to a planet and humanity under pressure. Originality/value – A rather innovative T&L approach to embed sustainability issues in undergraduate management students training in a highly international context. This is currently under-represented in academic writing and practice, in spite of the numerous programmes that nowadays bring students from all over the world to study together at higher education/university undergraduate level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cross-cultural management; Developing countries; Diversity management; Experiential learning; Higher education; Management development",,"De Loura, I.C.; Department of Business and Management, Regent’s University LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02621711,,,,"English","J.

Drawing on key insights from three streams of literature relating to institutional theory, critical perspectives on CSR in developing countries and the literature on CSR and SMEs in the developing world, the potential and limits of donor-financed management tools aimed at promoting CSR in developing country SMEs are analyzed.Design/methodology/approach - Using official UN and Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development lists of all multilateral and bilateral donor agencies, 38 donors that might have produced such CSR tools were identified. The authors contacted them via e-mail and/or telephone, and conducted an extensive Internet search with the aim of identifying whether they had developed management tools aimed at promoting CSR in SMEs in developing countries. The authors then scrutinized the contents of the 11 tools identified and examined the extent to which these tools accord attention to contextual differences and specific peculiarities of institutional environments in developing countries; the extent to which these tools account for the silent or sunken aspects of CSR which have.been prominently highlighted in the SME - CSR literature; and the extent to which these tools accord attention to the paramount concern for poverty alleviation in developing countries.Findings - Overall, the analysis testifies to the continued predominant orientation of these tools to the context of larger firms in developed countries, with insufficient tailoring or customization to the specific realities of SMEs in the South.Research limitations/implications - In-depth interviews with aid agency personnel, SMEs, workers or community members were not conducted. Hence, this study should be seen as an initial, exploratory desk study of the potential and limits of management tools aimed at promoting CSR in SMEs in the developing world.Practical implications - It is suggested that donor agencies could develop such tools in a bottom-up fashion by first mapping the silent CSR practices of SMEs in developing countries and then use this as a basis for strengthening existing CSR activities in SMEs instead of trying to impose new priorities from the outside. This might enhance the local relevance and applicability of these management tools.","CSR management tools; Developing countries; International donor agencies; Small and medium-sized enterprises",,"Lund-Thomsen, P.; Department of Intercultural Communication and Management, Copenhagen Business SchoolDenmark",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

We review and analyze the GC's activities and impact in enhancing corporate social responsibility since inception. First, we propose an analytical framework which allows us to assess the qualities of the UNGC and its principles in the context of external and internal elements that influence code effectiveness and implementation. Second, we analyze UNGC performance in encouraging companies to become signatory members and bring about demonstrable change in corporate CSR-sustainability activities. In its 10-year report, UNGC has proclaimed growth in both membership and program activity. However, all credible and publicly available data and documentation conclusively demonstrate that the UNGC has failed to induce its signatory companies to enhance their CSR efforts and integrate the 10 principles in their policies and operations. The result has been a loss of public trust and support of UNGC from important constituencies among civil society organizations, and those individuals and groups adversely impacted by corporate activities and resultant negative externalities. This diminished credibility has also made UNGC largely dependent on the corporate sector for its very survival. We conclude that this dependence has in turn impaired and would continue to hinder UNGC's ability to fulfill its mission.

Stewardship is a concept that has inspired the activities of several organizations whose mission is to preserve, protect and maintain natural, social and economic assets for the benefit of stakeholders and communities. As observed by Contrafatto and Bebbington (2013), stewardship has some resonance with current policy agendas that attend to the issues related to sustainable development, corporate social responsibility and accountability. Most of the existing works on stewardship provide several perspectives with the focus being either on normative foundations of stewardship or on its organizational and managerial implications. In particular, the stewardship-related literature offers a range of conceptions and approaches ranking from a relatively narrow view of the resources, sources and time frame of stewardship to very broad specification. In this article, the management, organization and accounting literature is analysed to propose a map of current theorizing on stewardship. In particular, drawing on the methodological approach adopted by Lowndes (1996), four theoretical vignettes have been proposed to illustrate different variants and approaches in stewardship framework. Each vignette provides a set of conceptual constructs, ideas and views to understand stewardship and stewardship-inspired behaviour. The variety of approaches/perspectives on stewardship, as illustrated from the analysis undertaken in this article, provides an opportunity for deeper theory-based understanding of social and organizational dynamics. In particular, it is argued that the richness of perspectives, focus and levels of analysis could offer insights to conceptualize, see and make sense of some of the challenges that are posed by a desire for promoting transition towards more sustainable ways of organizing our society.

Design/methodology/approach – The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in business has infiltrated since the latter half of the twentieth century. The hotel industry claims to engage in environmental sustainability due to the impact hotels have on the environment and considering the benefits that can arise from being environmentally friendly, such as positive corporate image and awareness of company’s stakeholders regarding company’s policies, practices and initiatives. A literature review regarding the current, most commonly used environmental practices and policies of hotels was conducted and content analysis was carried out in websites of companies and independent hotels in Dubai, UAE. Findings – Key findings showed that the environmental practices and policies which were the cheapest and easiest to implement were the most commonly used among hotels, and that hotel companies provided more corporate online environmental information than independent hotels. Overall, currently, hotels in Dubai do not effectively use online environmental reporting to their stakeholders, which should be an area of improvement by 2020.

On the other hand, it is consistently exposed to field expansion, given that a number of its underlying frameworks, commonly shared with other fields (such as sustainability and corporate social responsibility [CSR]), are opening up to wider vistas of conceptualization and theorization. This is often through the influence of practice as well as theory. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, it enhances our understanding of social entrepreneurship field development by identifying cross-currents and by highlighting new angles for paradigmatic and theoretical positioning. Second, it implements a framework that scholars previously employed within the original field of entrepreneurship (Bourdieu's theory of capitals and their transformations); in doing so, it also proceeds to propose an enrichment to the framework by including additional capitals that are specifically relevant for the field of social entrepreneurship and that are influenced by common agendas, as those exist in the fields of sustainability and CSR.

We argue that family firms, given their socioemotional wealth bias, have a positive effect on social dimensions linked to external stakeholders, yet have a negative impact on internal social dimensions. Thus, family firms can be socially responsible and irresponsible at the same time. We also suggest that institutional and organizational conditions act as catalysts in the relationship between firm type and corporate social responsibility (CSR). General support for our thesis that family firms neglect internal social dimensions came from the study of a sample of 598 listed European firms over a period of 4 years. Moreover, while national standards and industry conditions influence the degree of CSR in nonfamily firms, these factors do not affect family firms.

It offers a fruitful contribution to the literature and the understanding of responsibility, noting specifically the impact of the overall business and social culture prevalent at the times. Design/methodology/approach – Discussion of the railways touches on various stakeholders. It uses the four responsibilities of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) [economic, legal, ethical and discretionary (philanthropic)] as a framework against which to examine some of the actions taken in the railway companies. Reference is also made to the prevailing business culture of the times and how it may have impacted management practices of the times. The study considers real-world phenomena, where management is an applied field and where scholarship ties to the real-world phenomena practitioners face. Findings – Alack of Government participation in setting up the railways resulted in a slow reaction in terms of providing legislation to regulate the development and running of the railways. This, in turn, meant firms having to rely sometimes on their own discretion regarding what they considered responsible actions. While economic and social benefits of railways were in evidence, there was some evidence of financial irregularities, and safety issues for passengers were prominent issues of the day. Moreover, a lack of an efficient public relations function hindered dealing with public concerns. Despite impressive engineering achievements, some mistakes were made which involved loss of life and substantial financial costs. Originality/value – The combination of a historical approach and the use of the theoretical framework of the four responsibilities of CSR provide a novel view on aspects of entrepreneurial activity in a early industrialisation context.

The article presents a single in-depth case study of an Italian nonprofit organization (NPO) which has been measuring and reporting its IC for several years. The research project was conducted using an interpretative approach, by analyzing organizational IC reports in the light of a framework, derived from corporate social responsibility (CSR) and IC literature, able to provide researchers with useful insights to interpret the role played by IC report in the investigated organization. The lenses provided by the designed framework give researchers the opportunity to offer a skillful interpretation of the information provided by the IC report. From the analysis, it results that the investigated NPO use IC report more as a managerial rather than an accountability tool. Even though the use of a single case study provides in-depth and rich data, it also limits the generalizability of the observations to other companies. Moreover, the results obtained can be influenced by the model built and adopted to address the research question. The findings can support companies to enable IC reporting practices and readers to understand the orientation of the companies towards a reputation or an accountability approach by reading the IC report using the research model. The article fills a gap in the research of voluntary disclosure of NPOs from a different approach (i.e., to analyze IC reports to make evident the approach followed in disclosing IC information). So doing, the article contributes to narrowing the gap between IC theory and practice and offers new insights on the reasons why NPOs disclose IC.

Investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders are less trustful in recent decades. While rethinking what is needed to build trust in business environment, one of the most important subjects to discuss is increasing of business transparency because companies that are in conflict with their stakeholders cannot survive for a long run. Thus, corporate social reporting serves as a true opportunity to improve trust and competitiveness.Companies report on social issues under many different communication forms such as corporate social responsibility report, sustainability report, report to society, social report, communication on progress, social information disclosure on their websites or even annual reports. European countries, including Lithuania, haven’t formed a single system of corporate social reporting as social disclosure is voluntary. Thus, not only a relatively small number of companies make these statements, but at the same time they are different in content and structure, and therefore not always comparable. Stakeholders, assessing companies in the context of social responsibility and making socio-economic decisions, have no opportunity to use understandable and comparable information on human resources, products, environment control and public services. Thus the research question is directed to the identification of problems of corporate social reporting development both at the institutional and organizational levels.The objective of this paper is to analyze problems of social reporting and disclosure in Lithuania in order to increase the transparency of business activities. The research methods applied in this article are analysis of legal acts, logical and comparative analysis OFM scientific literature, dynamic and social reporting content analysis, problem analysis. As the article refers to corporate social reporting development in Lithuania, there is the theoretical background of researches mainly made in Lithuania carried out. This paper also presents the problems of social reporting in Lithuania from institutional and organizational views, the results from empirical researches of companies‘disclosed social information.The findings of the article show that still more declaratory socially responsible business ideas dominate in Lithuania, while the actual manifestation of social reporting is in the initial level. At the same time the most important thing should be the process of implementation of socially responsible business, as social reporting is rather a process for better business transparency than just a document. The process of corporate social reporting may be improved by strengthening legal framework and improving legal conditions for voluntary reporting. But at the same time the regulatory mechanism is not enough because trust is always related to main values driving the companies and their managers. © 2014, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Just as many service providers have adopted branding strategies, marketers are branding the health care service experience. Health care is an intimate service experience and emotions play an integral role in health care decision making. The purpose of this paper is to examine how emotional or affect-based consumer brand relationships are developed for health care organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical evidence from both depth interviews and data garnered from 322 surveys were integrated into a conceptual model. The model was tested using structural equation modeling. Findings: Results indicate that trust, referent influence and corporate social responsibility are key variables in establishing affective commitment in consumer brand relationships in a health care context. Once affective commitment is achieved, consumers may come to identify with the health care provider's brand and a self-brand connection is formed. When such a phenomenon takes place, consumers can serve as advocates for the brand by actively promoting it via word-of-mouth. Practical implications: The findings provide insight for marketing managers in developing successful branding strategies for health care organizations.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a quantitative survey of brand images found in food and branding literature and their impact on loyalty as well as customers' willingness to pay a price premium for consumer packaged food. Findings: The survey shows that quality is a significant determinant of price premium, but adding other image dimensions doubles the predictability and understanding about price premium. The strongest determinants of price premium are social image, uniqueness and home country origin. Other significant determinants are corporate social responsibility (CSR) and awareness.

The business strategy of any particular company in seeking to support sustainable fishing can vary, but may include the pursuit of market opportunities, protection from damaging publicity and corporate social responsibility commitments.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – In the current study, factors that may lead to strategic group formation were developed and used as clustering variables in a k-means cluster statistical analysis to categorize the firms into strategic groups. The factors used are entry costs, timing of entry, technology type and scope of operations. In addition, the number and type of competitive actions employed by the firms in the industry were identified by structured content analysis of a public source. The competitive actions were used to examine the dynamics of the resulting groups within the context of competitive behavior, resource and scope commitments and corporate social responsibility (CSR) actions. In addition, w2 analysis was employed to ascertain the likelihood that actions of a firm will be responded to by firms from the same group or from outside the group. Findings – License fees was found to be the most significant clustering variable. The study also showed that groups with significantly higher license fees carried out considerably more competitive actions, had higher resource and scope commitments and executed more CSR actions. In addition, the study revealed significantly more competition within strategic groups than between groups. Research limitations/implications – The absence of financial records for firms in the sample necessitated the use of CSR activity as a measure of firm performance. Some empirical studies have shown strong links between CSR and firm performance. Practical implications – The study revealed high mobility barriers which prevent ease of movement of firms in the industry from one strategic group to the other. Therefore regulators who wish to promote competition must do so by identifying the strategic groups with significant market power and permitting entry not by lowering entry barriers but by allowing the entry of firms with proven resources similar to the firms in those groups and to stipulate similar commitments in entry conditions. The results also offer management practitioners an insight into competitive behavior in the industry. Originality/value – The study utilized a unique data set (competitive actions of firms in the Nigerian Telecommunications industry as reported in the media) in contributing to empirical studies on competitive dynamics and strategic group literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive actions; Competitive dynamics; Industry regulation; Nigerian telecommunications Industry; Strategic groups",,"Adejuwon, O.O.; African Institute for Science Policy and Innovation, Formerly Technology Planning and Development Unit, Obafemi Awolowo UniversityNigeria",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20400705,,,,"English","Afr.

While some ""big-box"" retailers have launched ambitious environmental initiatives, others continue to conduct business as usual. This paper asks: why do some mega-retailers commit to ambitious environmental agendas while others in the same sector do not? And how can the answer to this question improve public policy? I investigate these questions using comparative case studies of four North American big-box retailers: Wal-Mart, Target, Costco and Kroger. My findings suggest that the socialization of senior executives through multi-stakeholder sustainability networks is the critical variable accounting for progressive environmental practices in some corporations and not others. This finding suggests that existing public policies that focus on making the business case for sustainability are based on incomplete assumptions about why companies ""go green.""

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative research method approach comprising personal interviews and observations targeted at consumers and business executives was used covering all four countries. Findings – Key findings include identification of middle of the pyramid (MOP) social networks, their impact on consumer behaviour and nature of consumer and firm interactions that take place as a result of the impact of social networks. Research limitations/implications – The sample size was restricted to 80 consumers in each of the four countries. This might limit generalisability. Practical implications – The study provides managers with insights on the potential role of social networks on marketing to the MOP in Africa. Social implications – The study provides managers with insights on the potential opportunities for corporate social responsibility solutions at the MOP. Originality/value – Research into the middle class in markets other than western advanced economies is a relatively new area of study.

Hundreds of professional football clubs are playing in their European football leagues. They attract supporters in front of the screen and in stadiums. The clubs in competitions are medium sized companies. They are competing and working together while they are delivering their core service, the game on the ground. The spectator can be considered as an important budget line for all clubs. Budgets are nevertheless often not balanced and stadium attendance is underdeveloped. We conducted research within two different football nations, France and Germany. Four clubs were in the sample and interviews with the management were carried out. The conceptual approach was based on brand image theories. Football clubs are specific sport brands. Brand image elements attract spectators into the stadium for those brands. These elements can explain the purchase intentions of season tickets and merchandising products. Our research revealed that common elements and differences exist between the clubs, each club having a brand identity. We identified which elements lead to purchase intentions and made best practices evident. The importance of the game is often overestimated by a club's management. The game and the attractiveness of the stadium are important, but not the only factors explaining stadium attendance. The club has also to be a ""good club in the community,"" and corporate social responsibility (CSR) becomes a crucial issue.","Brand equity; Brand image; Customer perceived image; Football",,"Blumrodt, J.; ESC Rennes School of BusinessFrance; email: jens.blumrodt@esc-rennes.fr",,"CIBER Institute",08927626,,,,"English","J.

The authors argue that success can be usefully conceptualized as a subjectively malleable and localized construct that is continually (re)interpreted and (re)shaped through the interaction between individual agency and macro-level structures. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a qualitative methodology drawing on 32 in-depth semi-structured interviews with female academics from eight countries in the Arab Middle East. Findings – Findings of this study provide an empirical validation of the suggested Career Success Framework and moves toward an integrative model of objective and subjective career success criteria. More specifically, the findings showed that women’s definitions of success are: first, localized in that they capture considerations relating to predominant institutions in the region (i.e. family and gender ideology); second, subjectively malleable in that they capture women’s agency embedded in specific macro-level structures; and finally, process oriented in that they reflect a dynamic interaction between the structure agency as well as the subsequent actions, strategies, and behaviors women adopt to alleviate tension and reach their personal notions of career success. Practical implications – The authors suggest that there may be value in customizing human resource management policies in the region around the salience of family and community service. Moreover, organizations can play a pivotal role in supporting women to work through the experienced tensions. Examples of such support are mentoring programs, championing female role models, and designing corporate social responsibility initiatives geared toward shifting mandated gender structures in the region. Finally, the authors argue that organizations could benefit by supporting women’s atypical patterns of career engagement to allow for interactions with wider circles of stakeholders such as the community. This requires organizations to rethink their career success criteria to allow for the integration of non-traditional elements of career. Social implications – Adopting a more process-oriented view of career success avoids reification by drawing attention to local macro-level structures as well as individual agency. It also suggests that existing norms for how “success” is understood are only one element in a wider process of what it means to be “successful”, thereby opening space for more diverse and localized conceptualizations. Originality/value – This paper provides a more process-oriented consideration of career success, highlighting the importance of understanding how perceived tensions shape an individual’s behaviors, actions, and career strategies. The value of this contribution is that it allows us to better understand the complex interaction of structure and agency in shaping an individual’s notions of career success. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Academic careers; Arab Middle East; Career success; Career theory; Cross-cultural management; Family; Gender; Higher education; Qualitative research; Structuration theory; Structure agency Paper type Research paper",,"Afiouni, F.; Olayan School of Business, American University of BeirutLebanon",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13620436,,,,"English","Career Dev.

The key issue from an institutional investor perspective is the assessment of whether green office buildings add value. Using an extensive portfolio of green office buildings, the purpose of this paper is to empirically assess the level of energy rating premiums in the property performance of green office buildings in Australia. Design/methodology/approach – Using a portfolio of over 200 green office buildings in Australia benchmarked against a comparable portfolio of non-green office buildings, the level of energy rating premiums in the property performance of green office buildings in Australia is empirically evaluated. Hedonic regression analysis is used to account for differences between specific office buildings and to explicitly identify the “pure” green effect in identifying the level of energy rating premiums in several commercial property performance characteristics (e.g. office value, rent). Findings – The empirical results show the added-value premium of the 5-star National Australian Built Environment Rating Scheme (NABERS) energy rating scheme and the Green Star scheme in the property performance of green office buildings in Australia, including office values and rents. Energy rating premiums for green office buildings are evident at the top energy ratings and energy rating discounts at the lower energy ratings. The added-value “top-end” premiumof the 5-star vs 4-star NABERS energy rating category is clearly identified for the various property performance parameters, including office values and rents. Practical implications – This paper empirically determines the presence of energy rating premiums at the top energy ratings in the performance of green office buildings, as well as energy rating discounts at the lower energy ratings. This clearly highlights the added value dimension of energy efficiency in green office buildings and the need for the major office property investors to prioritise the highest energy rating to facilitate additional property performance premiums. This will also see green office buildings become the norm as the market benchmark rather than non-green office buildings. Social implications – This paper highlights energy performance premiums for green office buildings. This fits into the context of sustainability in the property industry and the broader aspects of corporate social responsibility in the property industry. Originality/value – This paper is the first published property research analysis on the detailed determination of energy rating premiums across the energy rating spectrum for green office buildings in Australia. Given the increased focus on energy efficiency and green office buildings, this research enables empirically validated and practical property investment decisions by office property investors regarding the importance of energy efficiency and green office buildings, and the priority to achieve the highest energy rating to maximise property performance premiums in office values and rents.

An integrated report combines the most material elements of information about corporate performance (re: financial, governance, social and environmental functioning)-currently reported in separate reports-into one coherent whole. The authors first explore the motivation of companies and legislators to introduce integrating reporting. Next, they analyse how integrated reporting can be supported by legislation thereby taking into account the existing regulatory environment. Methodology/approach-Literature study; desk research, analysing integrated reports; organisation of an international academic conference (30 May 2012 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Findings-EU law needs adjusting in the field of corporate annual reporting. Although integrated reporting is currently being explored by some frontrunners of the business community and is being encouraged by investors, the existing legal framework does not offer any incentive, nor is uniformity and credibility in the reporting of non-financial information stimulated. The law gives scant guidance to companies to that end. The authors argue that amending the mandatory EU framework can support the comparability and reliability of the corporate information. Moreover, a clear and sound EU framework on integrated corporate reporting will assist international companies in their reporting. Presently, companies have to comply with various regulations at an EU and a national level, which do not enhance a holistic view in corporate reporting. The authors provide options on how to do this. They suggest combining EU mandatory corporate reporting rules with the private regulatory reporting regime developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Research limitations/implications-Focus on EU and Dutch corporate reporting laws, non-legislative frameworks, and corporate practices of frontrunners. Practical and social implications and originality/value of the chapter-The chapter can provide guidance to policymakers, companies and other stakeholders who want to form an opinion on how to legally support integrated reporting. It addresses important questions, especially concerning how European and domestic legislation could be adjusted in order to (i) reflect the newest insights regarding corporate transparency and (ii) become an adequate framework for companies with added benefits for financiers and investors. Moreover, it reports on the benefits of integrated reporting for reporting companies. The authors argue that integrated reporting can be a critical tool in implementing corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the main corporate strategy of a company.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper starts with an enquiry into the meaning of inspiration covering the semantic and etymological aspects of the word. References to inspiration are used to expand the meanings of other technical concepts relevant to the field of organisational studies. The research settings section of the paper describes the hermeneutic enquiry that was pursued to elicit an understanding of inspiration in the organisational context. The paper then demonstrates the key findings of the study cross-referenced to the reviewed literature to verify the accounts of the study's lay respondents. Findings: The findings strongly indicate that inspiration in its numerous manifestations is not confined to the domain of personal life and that it often occurs in organisational settings. There are no indications that inspiration is affected by the cultural belongingness of employees, rather it is found that attitudes towards inspiration differ among representatives of the different levels of the organisational hierarchy. A connection between motivation and inspiration is discussed and indication found that at the level of lay accounts the concepts are perceived to be both different and complementary.

Chinese diners’ knowledge about a real world brand’s CSR activities was also investigated. Design/methodology/approach – Setting the research context on the fast food industry in China and selecting McDonald’s as the subject brand, a survey study was conducted in a Southern Chinese mid-scale city. A convenience sample of 320 was withdrawn, and the data were analyzed with SPSS 18.0. Findings – Results from the study show that the Chinese fast food diners expect restaurant companies to attach more importance to “(product) nutrition and well-being (of customers)” and “environment sustainability” to be considered socially responsible. CSR performance was found to be the most influential factor in the consumers’ loyalty behaviors compared to customer satisfaction with service, product and the total visit experience. The study also found that many of McDonald’s CSR activities were unknown to the Chinese respondents. Originality/value – China is an attractive market to most global companies including fast food chain companies. Understanding Chinese diners’ expectations and perceptions toward companies’ CSR strategies will contribute to the success rate of companies operating in China. In addition, by using a real-world brands as the research context, the study tries to avoid perception bias of respondents due to the different interpretations of CSR in different organizations and industries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Consumer behaviour; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate strategy; Perception; Restaurants",,"Xu, Y.; Tourism College, Institute for Tourism StudiesChina",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09596119,,,,"English","Int.

Nowadays, and as a result of growing interest in environmental and social aspects of business performance and their impact on the company's long-term survival, the board's monitoring function over the economic and financial information has been extended to include sustainability reporting. This paper analyses the role played by certain features of the board, such as its size, level of activity and independence, as well as the diversity of its members, in the production and disclosure of a corporate social responsibility report. Previous empirical evidence regarding these new responsibilities undertaken by the board is mainly limited to cross-sectional analyses within single countries for a relatively short time period, and so the conclusions to be derived are necessarily restricted. In contrast, the present study involves the analysis of a sample of 690 listed companies from 10 European countries for the years 2004 to 2009.

Four dimensions of compatibility are explored: trade-off, ambidexterity, synergy and symbiosis.Design/methodology/approach – The intended contribution is essentially conceptual. A company case study is included to contribute to the development of the four dimensions of compatibility and support the practical relevance of the model. Twelve in-depth interviews with six managers in different functions of the company were conducted. A grounded theory approach was used to identify and express the patterns of compatibility that emerge from the qualitative data and how these patterns are grounded in managers’ meaning-in-use.Findings – The contribution of the compatibility framework is essentially made to the literature on environmental strategy management, evolved from an implicit and, at most, two-dimensional (win–win and win–lose) conceptualisation of the relationship between green and business strategy into an explicit and multi-dimensionally grounded identification of processes and strategic challenges of corporate environmental and social responsibility. The resulting model contributes to a better understanding of corporate greening as a strategic and moral concern to individuals acting on behalf of business organisations and a greater understanding of the linkages between green and business strategies and operations.Originality/value – By clarifying the construct of corporate environmental sustainability and providing useful directions for theory and practice, this research claims to inform green management decision-making. While the compatibility model is not intended to explain all pathways by which firms may elicit contingencies of relevance to environmental and social responsibility, it is suggested that the model paints a more complete and contextualized picture of environmental management mechanisms in business. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business environment; Business strategy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Sustainable development",,"Martinez, F.; Fabien Martinez is based at The Academy of Business In Society (ABIS)Belgium",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

This is of particular importance at this time given the financial industry's pivotal role in driving forward India's growth; this paper contributes to the literature on the operationalisation of CSR within one of the world's fastest growing economies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents empirical, on-the-ground qualitative evidence from the Indian finance sector with regard to CSR operations and motivations. Data are based primarily on a series of semi-structured interviews with ""elite"" participants; senior officials operating in the banking sector. Findings - The paper offers insight into four levels of CSR engagement which currently exist in the day-to-day operations of Indian companies. Of significance to debates on CSR trends and strategies, the paper presents evidence to suggest that western CSR initiatives are influencing executives in India; ultimately causing a reactive response of an ad-hoc nature. Research limitations/implications - While the focus of this paper is the Indian finance industry, the trends within this sector and emerging practice, one must be cautious about making broad generalisations about CSR in India based on the data presented here. Originality/value - A focus on responsible project finance and CSR is imperative at this time of major infrastructure growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) economies; indigenous financial institutions have a crucial role to play in social and economic development.

The paper also takes into consideration the role that corporate governance structure plays in customer CSR expectations. Design/methodology/approach: Analysing 648 customers of savings banks and 476 customers of commercial banks, several univariate statistics and two cluster analyses are implemented. Findings: The authors identify significantly consistent patterns in the CSR expectations of savings banks and commercial banks customers. The customers of both types of banking companies have similar high expectations concerning the CSR oriented to customers, shareholders and supervising boards, employees, the community and legal and ethical CSR. Also customers of both types of banking companies can be consistently classified as customer oriented, legally (customer)-oriented and CSR-oriented customers depending on their CSR expectations. Practical implications: These results have interesting implications for managers because it allows them to develop optimal CSR based on their customers' expectations. In this regard, it is observed that the CSR expectations of savings banks and commercial banks customers are quite homogeneous in such a way that the traditional differentiation in the CSR implemented by savings banks and commercial banks may be no longer justified. Originality/value: Previous scholars who have analysed customer CSR expectations have not studied them in a crisis context.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts Mattingly and Berman's typology to measure corporate social performance data, which differentiates primary stakeholder between institutional and technical. The first provides intangible support and the second tangible support to the firm. The hypotheses compare the effect that different social actions measures can have on corporate reputation (CR). The authors test the hypotheses empirically using two samples composed of US firms and two CR measures. Findings: The authors found that institutional stakeholders are deemed to hold normative expectations of a firm's behavior, impacting strongly on CR, unlike technical stakeholders, that have an economic exchange relationship with the firm. In addition to corporate social actions toward technical stakeholders are viewed as self-serving actions and are therefore less likely to impact on CR. Practical implications: The research can be very useful for business managers since it provides theoretical discussion and empirical proof about the effect of social actions on CR, which can assist them in designing or modifying social responsibility strategies used by the firm in order to build a positive CR.

With this increased attention and activity have come debates ranging across corporate authenticity, legislative necessity, and the scope of appropriate strategies. Through an historical analysis of four leading British industrialists of the 19th and early 20th centuries, this paper addresses the question of how corporate social accountability can be shaped and implemented by industrial leaders. It finds that while they may be motivated by a mix of business case agendas and their personal philosophical and religious beliefs, their accountability orientation reflects the latter. Social accountability in these cases, emerges as accountability rendered through action, reflecting organisational leaders' moral responsibility and their connecting their personal beliefs with action for the common good. In the light of parallels between historical and contemporary global industrial environments, the study identifies resonances between historical and contemporary corporate leader social responsibility values, initiatives and accountabilities through action. This opens up the possibility of a more nuanced understanding of motivations for and manifestations of corporate social responsibility and accountability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,"Parker, L.D.; School of Accounting, RMIT University, GPO Box 2476, Australia",,"Elsevier Ltd",03613682,,,,"English","Account.

As the country's remarkable and peaceful transition to democracy unfolds, millions, both urban and rural, are still confronted with having to survive unemployment, homelessness, lack of basic services, HIV/Aids, food insecurity and unacceptable levels of crime and violence. Confronted by the complexity of our development challenges, one of our biggest failures is a lack of communication, trust, common purpose, collaborative leadership and sustainable relationships between the various sectors and stakeholders in development. Transforming South Africa's society to remove the legacy of marginalization will be a long-term process requiring the sustained commitment of the leaders and people of the nation's diverse groups. So the question remains: how can non-profit organizations (NPOs) establish themselves as development providers within the uncertain political arena, of which South Africa is characteristic, in order to represent all the masses who cannot speak for themselves and more than often find themselves in a marginalized and stigmatized position? Principle results: Some Non-profit organizations recognize that their relationships with stakeholders is of great importance for their survival, various forms of communication take place without the necessary planning and without clear objectives for the development of these relationships. NPOs need a positive image and reputation due to financial implications where they do not have sufficient funds to support or market themselves effectively. In this climate of polarization NPOs play a pivotal role in providing a voice to the poor, mobilizing a motion of change and creating a platform for relationships, credibility and trust. Within the theoretical framework of relationship management theory, the interests of all stakeholders are balanced through the management of the stakeholder relationships. Major conclusions: Non-profit organizations need to ensure that they protect their stakeholders (especially those who are in desperate need of the services rendered by these organizations), deliver better services and although not operating for the purpose of making a profit, manage themselves so that they do generate profit which will enable them to support themselves especially when funding is something that is becoming a rare phenomenon. Although NPOs find themselves in difficult financial times they need to renovate and almost reinvent themselves, in order to be fully capable to address many social problems in SA and to indicate to those who support them (especially financially) that they are to be trusted, committed to make a difference, that they deliver on their promises and to ensure open communication channels with all their stakeholders. NPOs need to manage their reputations which are built on their corporate identities because it is the organization's reputation that often creates a lifeline in uncertain times. If the NPOs succeed in managing their identities effectively, it may serve as the foundation for developing and maintaining relationships with their respective stakeholders which in turn could change the face of South Africa's society. These organizations might go about creating a platform for dialog in an attempt to build sustainable productive relationships that can go about uplifting and empowering those who would otherwise not have such an opportunity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate identity; Non-profit organizations; Public relations; Relationship management; South-Africa; Stakeholder management",,"Holtzhausen, L.; School of Communication Studies, G17, N-W Univ.-Potchefstroom Campus, Private Bag X6001, Potchefstroom 2520, North-West Province, South Africa; email: Lida.Holtzhausen@nwu.ac.za",,"Elsevier BV",03638111,,PRERE,,"English","Public Relat.

To date, however, little academic research has investigated how knowledge of police performance impacts citizens' trust. We address this long-standing lacuna by exploring citizens' trust before and after exposure to real performance data in the context of a British police force. The results reveal that being informed of performance data affects citizens' trust significantly. Furthermore, direction and degree of change in trust are related to variations across the different elements of the reported performance criteria. Interestingly, the volatility of citizens' trust is related to initial performance perceptions (such that citizens with low initial perceptions of police performance react more significantly to evidence of both good and bad performance than citizens with high initial perceptions), and citizens' intentions to support the police do not always correlate with their cognitive and affective trust towards the police. In discussing our findings, we explore the implications of how being transparent with performance data can both hinder and be helpful in developing citizens' trust towards a public organisation such as the police.

More recently, the acceptance of new technologies has increasingly been influenced by secondary stakeholders, some of which are difficult to identify, or whose concerns are not easily reconciled. This paper develops a conceptual framework based on the management of technology and research & development literature, stakeholder theory, risk and social judgment to describe how traditional approaches based on reducing uncertainties through estimating probabilities may not work for social uncertainties; different heuristics are needed to understand and resolve such heterogeneous stakeholder perspectives. We contribute to the discourse by describing how risk perceptions among stakeholders vary, and how this may change over time. The framework suggests that the perception of primary stakeholder towards a specific innovation is 'Standard' when information is well known, but becomes riskier when information is unclear. For secondary stakeholders, when there is a low degree of imperfect information, the stakeholder relationship is an 'Irritant' but becomes increasingly 'Dangerous' when information becomes ambiguous.

We measure the level of CSD in annual reports using a disclosure instrument based on the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development report ""Guidance on Corporate Responsibility Indicators in Annual Reports"". We find that IFRS adoption had a differential effect on CSD based on a firm's institutional setting i.e., the stakeholder-management relationship prevalent in their institutional environment. Firms in the stakeholder countries did not have a significant change in the level of CSD following the mandatory adoption of IFRS while firms from the shareholder countries experienced a significant increase over the same period resulting in shareholder countries providing an overall higher level of CSD after IFRS adoption than stakeholder countries. These findings suggest that firms' reactions to the requirements of IFRS and the stakeholder pressure to provide additional CSD are influenced by institutional environment.

Human praxis will result, but only when sufficiently powerful interests are motivated to act. This paper aims to examine the role that the accreditation of business schools can play in increasing institutional contradictions and hence fostering organisational change towards stakeholder engagement and engagement with social responsibility and sustainability issues. Numerous accreditations are promulgated within the higher education and business school contexts and a number of these relate to, or have aspects that relate to, ethics, social responsibility and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The paper first analyses the take up of accreditations across UK business schools and then uses a case study to illustrate and explore stakeholder engagement and changes related to ethics, social responsibility and sustainability linked to accreditation processes. Findings: Accreditations are found to be an increasingly common interest for UK business schools. Further, a number of these accreditations have evolved to incorporate issues related to ethics, social responsibility and sustainability that may cause institutional contradictions and may, therefore, have the potential to foster organisational change. Accreditation alone, however, is not sufficient and the authors find that sufficiently powerful interests need to be motivated to act and enable human praxis to affect change. Research limitations/implications: This paper draws on previous research that considers the role of accreditation in fostering change that has also been carried out in healthcare organisations, public and professional bodies. Its findings stem from an individual case study and as such further research is required to explore whether these findings can be extended and apply more generally in business schools and universities in different contexts. Practical implications: This paper concludes by recommending that the newly established UK & Ireland Chapter of PRME encourages and supports signatory schools to further embed ethics, social responsibility and sustainability into all aspects of university life in the UK. This also provides an opportunity to engage with the accrediting bodies in order to further support the inclusion of stakeholder engagement and issues related to this agenda in their processes. Originality/value: This paper contributes by introducing accreditation as an institutional pressure that may lead indirectly to organisational change and supports this with new evidence from an illustrative case study. Further, it draws on the role of institutional contradictions and human praxis that engender organisational change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accreditation; Ethics; Neo-institutional theory; Responsibility; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability",,"Cooper, S.; Accounting and Finance, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom; email: s.m.cooper@bristol.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09513574,,,,"English","Account.

The articles in this special issue examine CR initiatives at multiple levels (the firm, industry, national, and global) as well as CR mechanisms ranging from ""go-it-alone"" unilateral activities to collaborative partnerships. The study goals are two-fold. First, the authors focus on firms' attempt to create and manage a portfolio of corporate responsibilities-social, political, environmental, and economic. These responsibilities involve relationships with a range of stakeholders (investors, employees, consumers, suppliers, and distributors as well as its multiple communities), often simultaneously, and recognizing that the corporation can devote limited resources to manage stakeholder expectations in this regard. Second, the authors seek to understand how institutional and competitive contexts matter in shaping specific CR choices to provide tangible evidence of managing responsibly. The authors suggest that consciously aligning CR initiatives (what) with appropriate mechanisms (how) will allow the corporations to efficiently and effectively pursue their CR objectives and arguably create sustained impact. © 2013 SAGE Publications.","corporate responsibility; CSR; initiatives; mechanisms; organizational choices",,"Griffin, J.

Results from the analysis of these 25 financial institutions show that public ownership of the bank and the existence of a code of conduct are necessary conditions for participation in the Wolfsberg Group, whereas factors related to the type of financial institution, combined with the existence of a black list, are sufficient for explaining participation. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","banking; corporate responsibility; fuzzy-set analysis; regulation; Wolfsberg principles",,"Maggetti, M.; University of Lausanne, Institute of Political and International Studies (IEPI)Switzerland",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

Drawing on social movement theory, we conceptualize how private regulation opportunity structures affect such CR-based activist groups' targets and tactics at both the firm and field levels. At the field level, we argue that both radical and reformative activist groups direct most of their time and resources towards PRIs with comparatively more stringent standards. At the firm level, while radical activist groups are likely to target firms participating in more stringent PRIs, reformative activist groups target firms participating in less stringent PRIs, or those that do not participate in PRIs at all. When facing unfavourable opportunity structures, CR-based activist groups tend either to advocate the creation of new PRIs or to shift their activities to pressure other focal points. This article contributes to moving beyond extant literature's emphasis of PRIs as settlements of contentious firm-activist interactions towards also viewing them as starting points for activist groups aiming to push firms towards a more substantive CR engagement. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.","Activism; Corporate responsibility; Political opportunity structures; Private regulation; Private regulatory initiatives; Social movements",,"Mena, S.; Cass Business School, City University London, 106 Bunhill Row, United Kingdom",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00222380,,,,"English","J.

Within the framework of the MEC, the authors conduct a normative analysis-based on the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)-of the state duties andcorporate responsibilities for adverse human rights impacts in the complex. The authors use a single, indepth case study approach, focussing on the case of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazonian state of Pará. The MEC proves to be a useful framework for studying the advancement of hydroelectricity and mining projects on the Amazonian frontier. The analysis indicates that the Brazilian minerals and energy sectors are mutually dependent and have overlapping interests and decision-making structures. Applying the MEC framework to the Belo Monte case serves to clarify and detangle the relationships between the various actors associated with the dam's adverse impacts. This provides a foundation for the normative analysis of the responsibilities and actions required of each actor based on the internationallyaccepted standards in the UNGPs. By applying the MEC as an analytical research framework and drawing on the UNGPs for normative guidance, the present study contributes to the academic literature on corporate responsibility, as well as providing policy and decision-makers with a normative-empirical analysis that can be drawn upon to improve policy and ensure that corporate activity contributes to sustainable development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An understanding of this relationship can help firms respond to a variety of pressures from organizations and this knowledge may help firms prevent negative media coverage with the need to “bolt” CR strategies on to existing corporate strategies. When firms have an understanding of how country risk affects them, they can plan entire clusters of CR initiatives to fulfill needs within the operating community. To understand the CR–country risk relationship, the authors build on Matten and Moon’s (2008) distinction between implicit and explicit CR. The first argument is that firms engage in no explicit CR (explicit CR that is voluntary and goes beyond legal requirement) when country risk is very high. As country risk lowers to high, firms engage in explicit CR, which creates little impact to the firm if CR must be withdrawn. The second argument is that as country risk shifts to moderate, firms commence to engage in high levels of explicit CR and low levels of implicit CR. The third argument concludes that when country risk shifts to low or very low, firms will engage in the least amount of explicit CR and the most amount of implicit CR. A set of three propositions develops these arguments. © 2013 SAGE Publications.","corporate responsibility; country risk; CSR; CSR strategy",,"Rodríguez, L.C.; University of South Carolina-Aiken, 471 University Pkwy, United States",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",00076503,,,,"English","Bus.

For many, this has not been an easy transition. This article focuses on a case study of an Australian university program aimed at leveraging staff/student behavioural change and wider institutional change by starting with sustainable transport (ST) in a context where the case study university was coming from a low base on sustainability outside teaching activities. The case study research program aimed to (1) engage with internal and external stakeholders identified with barriers and facilitators to ST, (2) encourage more ST behaviours via explicit Travel Plan strategies and (3) utilize the project to embed ST policy and programs institutionally and act as a catalyst for more extensive and integrated sustainability performance across a multi-camps university. In terms of strategic choice of the case study, this project was the first under the State Government (of Victoria, Australia) HEI TravelSmart program to embrace both staff and students in a 'whole of campus-community approach' to sustainable transport. The methods adopted - using behaviour change activities, travel plan, staff/student surveys and approaches identified with the TravelSmart brand - were not restricted to a social marketing interventions model, but took on an advocacy/feedback approach informed by stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984, 2009) and a stakeholder policy advocacy strategy using a mixed method ecological social marketing model (Halpern et al., 2004). Over a period of four years the funded research facilitated a complex action-oriented case study that achieved some progress towards improved sustainability in travel behaviour and university policies, programs and capital works to address barriers. The participatory design fostered formal and informal networks that developed organizationally to foster environmental politics and develop a form of institutional ecological citizenship (Dobson, 2003) within the steering committee, and in terms of external advocacy. Matched university and government sourced research funding that financed a behaviour change and stakeholder engagement strategy and buy-in from key internal stakeholders, were key facilitators of organizational changes in policy, resourcing and organizational commitment to sustainability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors argue that sustainability challenges should be addressed simultaneously at the individual, organizational, sectorial, national and supranational level. Financial institutions have a systemic impact on the economy, and on the functioning of our societies. Therefore, a culture of profit maximization and unbridled risk-taking, notwithstanding the external costs and impacts, contaminates not only the financial system and the economy, but also individual norms of responsibility. In this line of reasoning, the global financial crisis revealed the destabilizing effects on the economy, society and corporations and forms a serious impediment for sustainable business. This is a huge challenge for sustainability business and corporate governance; however, it is an illusion to think that managers can prevent scandals and moral norm deterioration without support from other social players.Design/methodology/approach – This paper offers a conceptual analysis on the past financial crisis (2008-2012). It questions the focus on sustainability at the corporate level, and suggests a more comprehensive method for governance. The authors argue in favour of sustainability implementation, combining different governance levels.Findings – The double-dip financial crisis 2008-2012 showed the failure of an unsustainable global system. It becomes clear that corporate responsibility and corporate governance are limited in their contribution to sustainable business in a sustainable economy. Hence, it is important to have a more integrated approach to address sustainability risks, with a solution at individual, sectorial, national and supranational governance levels.Research limitations/implications – This contribution advances five different levels of governance to mitigate risks for sustainable business, arguing in favour of integrated governance for sustainability risks. However, an empirical validation of these ideas still needs to be developed. Future empirical research is needed to validate the five levels of governance. Future research is also needed to better grasp the mechanisms in support of governance.Practical implications – Corporate responsibility and corporate governance are necessary but not sufficient conditions to address the sustainability risks one faces. All actors in the economy recognize that governance for sustainable business in a sustainable economy is a collaborative effort for which neither legislative nor institutional or behavioural norms are developed in an integrated way. They should also recognize that integrated governance is not only imperative for the common good, but also in the direct interest of shareholders and other stakeholders.Originality/value – This paper contributes to the literature on corporate responsibility and corporate governance with the identification of specific roles for regulators, sector representatives and individuals, which are complementary to the role of the companies in creating the conditions for sustainable business in a sustainable economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Corporate responsibility; Global governance; Risk management; Sustainability",,"Lenssen, J.-J.; The Academy of Business in Society (ABIS)Belgium",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

The analysis is based on a survey data collected from 165 Finnish firms. The main findings are that the strategicness of supply management and supply management's end-customer orientation influence the company's adoption of green supply management.

This contribution discusses the tension between this formal recognition and concrete realities in rural development for traditional Amazonian communities by examining large-scale land acquisitions in Brazil, a land-abundant developing country, in the wake of the 2007-08 global food price crises. This study applies anthropological and legal perspectives to analyze problems related to gender inequality caused by large-scale land acquisitions. It argues that inequalities cannot be resolved by simply changing regulations related to traditional communities' and women's rights and that gender relations and land tenure issues reflect interconnected social arrangements based on historical specificities of traditional communities. Case studies show that land acquisitions by outsiders disrupt these arrangements, despite stated commitments to social and environmental responsibility. Such ""coercive harmony"" is only unmasked when communities are conscious of their rights, enabling effective use of the legal apparatus. © 2014 © 2014 IAFFE.","Amazon; development; food security; Gender; land",,"Shiraishi Neto, J.; Federal University of Maranhão - Direito, São Luis, Maranhão, Brazil; email: jshiraishi@uol.com.br",,"Routledge",13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

Prior to the commencement of CEL, the government engaged with business stakeholders in a round of structured consultations. This engagement process elicited various responses to the proposed laws from stakeholder firms and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Accordingly, in this paper we have used environmental management theories to examine the responses of firms and NGOs and identify critical 'pressure points' associated with the new laws. The results from our analysis showed that, during the consultations, stakeholders predominantly used pre-emptive responses and communications to shape and change the CEL. In addition, the critical legislative pressure point for business stakeholders was the capacity to manage carbon pricing liabilities in order to maintain sound ongoing financial and investment performance. The study also showed that the use of highly defensive and aggressive responses were ineffectual and did not materially impact the introduction of the new laws. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Engagement; Environmental; Firms; Influence; Laws; Stakeholders",,"Martin, N.J.; The Australian National University, Accounting and Business Information Systems, ANU CBE Bldg 26c, Australia",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",09644733,,,,"English","Bus.

Many argue that it was the failure of PT. Lapindo during the drilling process but the verdict of the District Court of South Jakarta decided that it was a natural disaster. Environmental crime provision is stated in The Environmental Management Act 2009 No. 32 but this stipulation does not reduce the number of corporate environmental crimes as there are other factors involved such as enforcement. The protection of people's environmental human rights is also recognized under The Law of 1999 No. 39 on Human Rights. Regrettably, prosecuting corporate environmental crime from the angle of human rights is at a dead-lock due to the fact that the Indonesian Human Rights Court is only authorized to prosecute genocide crimes and crime against humanity. Nevertheless, the corporate sector should take the responsibility to restore the ecosystem where disasters have occurred. In view of this gap, some primary data, like statutes, regulations and international conventions; also secondary data such as articles, reports and news papers have been obtained from literature study and internet sources and are descriptively and qualitatively analyzed.

By changing the details of the scenario, we examine the influence of (a) the harasser’s organizational role (i.e., a supervisor or coworker), (b) the existence of corporate sexual harassment policies, and (c) the company’s past responses to sexual harassment complaints. The results suggested that the harasser’s organizational role is the most important factor for predicting whether an individual would consider pressing a sexual harassment claim. Respondents’ assessment that the victim should make a claim is higher when the harasser is an immediate supervisor rather than a nonsupervisory coworker. Perceived organizational responsibility is also a direct predictor of intent to make a claim. The results provide a clearer understanding of when an individual is more likely to favor making a claim in response to perceived sexual harassment. The practical implications include the following: (a) Sexual harassment training for supervisors is important because their sexual harassment is most likely to lead to a legal claim, (b) antisexual harassment policies have the effect of reducing the likelihood that a victim will perceive the organization as responsible for failing to prevent a supervisor’s action, and (c) organizations should make clear their opposition to sexual harassment both to discourage harassers and to divert a victim’s attribution for responsibility away from the organization if an incident takes place. © The Author(s) 2013.","human resources; legal claiming; organizational attribution; organizational behavior; responsibility attribution",,"Abbott, J.A.L.; Conrad N.

Although our overall definition of sustainability is a process, the George Washington University (GW) definition of water sustainability is articulated through construction of an objective-value hierarchy representing GW's strategic objectives and articulation of strength of preference among the attributes in that hierarchy. This study used multi-criteria decision analysis methods, including structured interviews with four individual stakeholders and swing weighting. Three findings are of note. First, our stakeholders' thinking about their objectives was greatly influenced by perceived constraints and mandatory obligations on institutional performance implied by contracts or tradition. Second, in considering the trade-off weights obtained from the swing-weighting portion of the value assessment, all stakeholders placed similar emphasis on each of the fundamental objectives. Third, because of the decentralized nature of the university, the process through which the value assessment will be achieved must be transparent and accepted by each of the stakeholders supporting sustainability decisions. This case study illustrates a decision-analytic sustainability approach that may be applied to large-scale infrastructure systems, stakeholder engagement and negotiation in sustainability investments or alternatives assessments. Although the commitment to reduce climate impacts has been widespread, there have been fewer publicly announced water initiatives at the university level. At the university level, GW is only one of a handful of universities with a cohesive, visible, water plan. In addition, we demonstrate an approach in which explicit structuring of fundamental sustainability objectives may increase transparency for sustainability definition construction. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Decision analysis; Higher education; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Strategic planning; Sustainability definition; Urban water sustainability",,"Francis, R.A.; Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering, 1776G St. NW #101, Washington, DC, 20006, United States; email: seed@gwu.edu",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",10579214,,,,"English","Journal of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905028795

Many believe that project management, change management, and related fields, are a matter of marshalling stuff: working the right processes and tasks, writing the correct documents, having good governance mechanisms in place, etc. People just distract and get in the way. Some tend to concentrate on these technicalities working their computer tools, rather than leaning towards people. The result is huge waste. Organisational change will always cut across different business functions, boundaries and across silos of working. This is where stakeholder engagement leads to successful outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: It is a surprise to many, but listening is probably the most powerful influencing strategy of all. The key is to ask the person you seek to influence, first for their thoughts, fears, and aspirations. If you can show you are genuinely interested, you begin to break down any barriers to change. This helps focus on the need for change rather than present the solution first. Yes, time is money, but often we can let this get in the way of engaging successfully. Conversations like this do take time. It feels counter-intuitive. Findings: There is growing evidence that people who make better leaders have a leaning towards action, they are never victims of ""paralysis by analysis"". The self-aware, pro-active manager leading change understands that relationships are central to success and are thinking about their relationships in a real and active way. They think about their mental landscape and on that landscape they see the vital importance of stakeholders and are prepared to spend a far higher proportion of their discretionary time devoted to engaging with other people, quite apart from the structured meetings and emails that we usually describe as ""communicating"". Originality/value: Most management books are written with the assumption that the business world is rational, but when it comes to change, it appears this is far from the case. We are taught to put a reasonable proposition to people, the business case, the plan, and so on, then expect people to mull it over for a while, then jump into action - reason - analyse - act. But nearly always the actual sequence is - see - feel - act. There is little doubt that people engage with their stakeholders better if there is some kind of emotional connection. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change; Engagement; Project management; Stakeholders",,"Mayfield, P., Wantage, United Kingdom; email: Patrick.Mayfield@Pearcemayfield.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",00197858,,,,"English","Ind.

In 2011, the city completed a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory that serves as the basis for current sustainability planning processes, and the process to complete this analysis was uniquely collaborative and is offered as a case study. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This inventory was the product of collaboration between the city, the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and the Central New York Regional Planning and Development Board, through the Climate Change Innovation Program. Following guidance from International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives's Local Government Operations Protocol and utilizing Clean Air and Climate Protection software, the baseline year for the inventory was 2002, and the municipal analysis covered five sectors: buildings and facilities, vehicle fleet, aviation, water delivery, and streetlights and traffic lights. The city's community analysis assessed residential, commercial and industrial energy use, transportation and waste sectors. Findings: The City of Syracuse has achieved energy and GHG reductions over the inventory timeframe. While savings have been accomplished, significant challenges to future energy and GHG reductions remain. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include obtaining data quality and consistency for analysis. Practical implications: This case study could serve as a model for moving forward with GHG inventory analysis and action for small- to medium-sized cities in the NE, USA. Social implications: This was an experiment in collaboration between an academic institution, NGOs and a municipal entity. Originality/value: The city's 2010 inventory has been followed by community outreach and stakeholder engagement for the sustainability planning process. The city formed advisory teams composed of community experts in the areas of energy and green building, natural environment, waste and recycling, education and outreach, and food systems. The collaborative approach the city utilized offers a helpful model for other municipalities to follow to overcome resource constraints and complete energy and cost-saving carbon footprinting assessments. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gases; Municipal; Sustainability",,"Smardon, R.

Islamic banking expanded in the world within the last decade and as a result, Islamic finance emerged as an alternative to the conventional finance. This created Islamic companies and Islamic financial institutions which operate based on the principles of Shari'ah or Islamic Law. These Islamic corporate bodies, like the conventional corporate bodies do need good governance rules. In other words, they also need a good, sophisticated ""Shari'ah Governance Code"" which would be based on the principle of Islamic Law. This is mainly because the objective of the conventional and the Islamic Corporate governance is different as conventional corporate governance structure is more focused on the protection of the rights of the stakeholders; while Islamic corporate governance focus on retaining the Islamicity of whole corporation. The objective of this research is, as the title suggests, proposing the reasons why a special governance Code for Shari'ah corporate bodies are needed. This paper would suggest a proper governance structure to the Islamic companies and will also discuss why the conventional corporate governance Codes are unsuitable for the Islamic companies. Design/methodology/approach: This research which is primarily library based, is an exploratory legal research in nature. Findings: In the course of this research, it is found that there is a need to enact a Shari'ah Corporate Governance Code due to the widespread establishment of shari'ah compliant companies in the world.

It discusses the key national tourism policies, plans, and strategies, which together provide the framework for tourism development and management in the country. The importance of balancing a ""topdown"" framework with ""bottom-up"" local engagement is emphasized as a cornerstone of South Africa's future tourism journey. In line with the philosophy that ""structure should follow strategy"", the institutional framework to manage tourism during the next planning period is outlined.

This development along with the growing power of SNS providers calls for an investigation of the CSR engagement of SNS companies. The chapter examines to what extent three prominent providers-Google, Facebook and Twitter-fulfill their responsibilities. Methodology/approach-The chapter draws heavily on a politicized concept of CSR, namely 'corporate citizenship' (Crane, Matten, & Moon, 2008a; Matten & Crane, 2005) and 'political CSR' (Scherer & Palazzo, 2007, 2011) and discusses the role SNS providers play in administering citizenship rights. The chapter takes a qualitative case study approach. Findings-Facebook, Twitter and Google have not only made clear commitments to act responsibly, they actually enhance the citizenship status of their users in many ways, e.g. by offering a platform for democracy activists. Deficiencies and contradictions also become visible, e.g. SNS providers inhibit citizenship by failing to provide sufficient privacy protection. Research limitations/implications-The chapter is limited by its case study approach, but provides valuable insights to an industry with considerable influence. It contributes to CSR research by applying and testing the politicized concept of CSR in the context of SNS providers. Originality/value- Although SNS have received appraisal as effective tools of CSR communication, there has been little attention to CSR policy and practice of the companies providing social networks. This is unfortunate since the activities of SNS providers directly impact on millions of users worldwide.

It aims to adopt a structuralist and functionalist perspective and develop an enabling conceptualisation of power that incorporates structural and agency components in stakeholders’ reasons for engaging. Based on the conceptual interdependencies between stakeholder power and engagement, this study aims to present the limitations of previous studies on destination leadership in this area, and this paper also seeks to discuss implications for destination leadership. Design/methodology/approach – As a qualitative and exploratory study, mixed-method research was adopted using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with destination stakeholders from a prominent tourism action group. The primary research was carried out in an English seaside resort between 2010 and 2011. Data are used to draw a stakeholder map as a visual tool. Findings – Eight elements of enabling power are confirmed to be of importance in identifying stakeholder power and engagement. The level of power varies depending on stakeholders’ position within a network. These findings direct attention towards adopting a complexity leadership approach in an increasingly competitive destination environment. Research limitations/implications – The paper focuses on an English seaside resort, although results can be transferred to other similar-sized destinations where the focus is on local tourism policy development. Originality/value – The paper provides an innovative conceptualisation of power in stakeholder theory by drawing primarily on a sociological understanding of power as an enabler and not as an inhibitor for development, leadership and change in seaside resorts.

Doing so highlights the strategic, relational nature of place branding. The authors focus specifically on first- and zero-order capabilities, integrating absorptive capacity (first-order) and an innovation capability (zero-order) into a place branding framework. We define an innovation capability within a place branding context and offer absorptive capacity as a mechanism through which DMO leaders can exploit external knowledge acquisition.Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a theoretical framework of the place branding process that integrates firm capabilities. A framework based on analyzing existing place branding models and integrating organizational capabilities, which find root in strategic management literature, was developed.Findings – Findings indicate that existing frameworks address operational and customer capabilities in some manner yet largely ignore innovation capabilities. A definition of an innovation capability for place brand managers and scholars is offered, and offer absorptive capacity as means to integrate external knowledge into the DMO. Utilizing multiple levels of capabilities allows a firm to influence customer-based brand equity. Testable propositions based on the authors’ framework are offered.Practical implications – Managerial implications of integrating stakeholder capabilities into place branding include appreciating a culture of innovation within DMOs, learning from external stakeholders meaningfully and regularly and encouraging creative thinking that can produce new processes, policies or services.Originality/value – By integrating organizational capabilities, attention is drawn to internal aspects of the place branding process the place can control directly. Capabilities dictate how an organization sees itself; learns from its stakeholders; and then integrates that knowledge into organizational, stakeholder and innovation capabilities. Therefore, capabilities are inherently internal mechanisms through which a DMO can influence place brand outcomes, which are understood here as brand equity elements. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Organizational capabilities; Place branding; Stakeholder engagement",,"Zavattaro, S.M.; Department of Political Science and Public Administration, Mississippi State UniversityUnited States",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17538335,,,,"English","J.

In particular, the paper outlines the context in which papers in a special section on this topic might be understood as well as developing propositions for how a research focus might emerge in this area. The paper, therefore, seeks to contribute to discussions about whether, under which circumstances and how social accountability and engagement processes focusing on sustainable development might trigger, frame and/or promote change processes in HEIs. The papers that compose this special section are also introduced and future research avenues offered. Design/methodology/approach: Literature review Findings: Despite a dearth of literature in the area of HEI responsiveness to sustainable development (and leaving side education/learning and research for sustainable development), numerous points of intersection exist. Foremost among these is the role of HEIs as shapers of the values of society (and a place for debates about these values). In addition, HEIs are substantive organisations with sustainable development impacts. The paper suggests, however, that understanding HEIs and self-consciously seeking change in their activities has to seriously engage with the characterisation of these organisations as loosely coupled systems.

Traditionally, project management is considered to be performance focused and task oriented, whilst programme management entails a more strategic focus. The programme management literature suggests that this can result in tensions between the management of the projects and the programme as a whole. This paper uses the findings of the €2.4. billion Room for the River flood protection programme in the Netherlands as a case study, because indicators about its budget, time, quality and stakeholder satisfaction suggest high programme management performance upon completion of the planning and design stage of its 39 river widening projects. Based on a literature review, document analysis and 55 face-to-face interviews, we have analysed how the programme management of the programme contributed to this result. Six attributes for effective programme management that are identified from the project and programme management literature are used to structure the research data. Consecutively, the interactions between project and programme management are analysed. The analysis of Room for the River reveals a combined strategic/performance focus at the level of both programme and project management that enables a collaborative approach between programme and project management. This particularly enables effective stakeholder collaboration, coordination and adaptation of the programme to contextual changes, newly acquired insights and the changing needs of consecutive planning stages, which positively contributes to the performance of the programme as a whole. © 2014 IPMA and Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive programme management; Alignment; Flood protection; Netherlands; Programme management; Programme success; Project management; Room for the River; Stakeholder engagement","Alignment; Budget control; Flood control; Floods; Project management; Rivers; Flood protection; Netherlands; Programme management; Programme success; Stakeholder engagement; Information management; adaptive management; flood control; performance assessment; planning method; project management; stakeholder; strategic approach; Netherlands","Rijke, J.; Flood Resilience Group, UNESCO-IHE, Delft, Netherlands; email: j.rijke@unesco-ihe.org",,"Elsevier Ltd",02637863,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach – A value approach was applied to develop a model of retrofit activities. A Europe wide stakeholder engagement, consisting of over 50 face-to-face interviews with key informants with energy efficiency retrofit (EER) knowledge and expertise, informed analyses on flows of both tangible and intangible value for commercial EER projects. Findings – Given the need to expand the EER marketplace, the sustainability of EER processes is as important as the sustainability of EER project outcomes. Understanding value creation in retrofit processes is crucial to successfully harnessing the available energy savings potential from the built environment. Practical implications – The increasing importance of externalities, such as carbon, means that previously unaccounted for costs are now being considered in business models. For EER projects, the challenge is to respond to this new business environment, while maintaining adequate value for stakeholders. For commercial property developers, this means a growing impetus to understand the value propositions of other EER stakeholders. Originality/value – The evaluation of value creation across business relationships such as those of the construction industry has not been conducted in a systematic manner to date.

This study attempts to reconcile these diverse views and uncover the phenomenon from a business leader’s point of view. Based on rational egoism theory, this article proposes a formal mathematical model of responsible leadership that considers different types of incentives for stakeholder engagement. The analyses reveal that monetary and instrumental incentives are neither sufficient nor necessary for business leaders to consider societal and environmental stakeholder needs. Non-monetary and non-instrumental incentives, such as leaders’ values and authenticity, as well as their planning horizons, counterbalance pure monetary and instrumental orientations.

South African-listed companies are among the first in the world to be subject to compliance with IR requirements in terms of stock exchange listing requirements. IR, as a novel and evolutionary step in corporate reporting, along with the influence that integrated thinking and IR principles will have on companies, has been the subject of global debate in recent years.Design/methodology/approach - The research instrument used in the study comprised a self-administered Web-based survey aimed at CEOs and CFOs of all South African listed companies. The survey was validated by a pre-trail and data analysed by a statistician to ensure reliability.Findings - The study revealed that listed companies, in a mandated regulatory regime implemented in a short period with reference to a highly prescriptive draft framework, attach value to the IR process primarily from the perspective of their corporate reputation, investor needs and stakeholder engagement and relations. This strengthens the business case for voluntary IR as a reporting regime. Advancement of corporate reputation appears to be a key motive to compile an integrated report, secondary to compliance as a primary motive. This indicates the perceived corporate legitimising effect of producing an integrated report. Furthermore, managers are more motivated by the legitimising aspect of advancing corporate reputation and stakeholder needs in compiling the integrated report than satisfying investor needs. This results in a disconnect between the perceived audience of the report by managers and the intended audience of the report as providers of capital as envisioned by the IIRC, which should be a matter for future consideration. Better resource allocation decisions and cost reductions are not indicated as an outcome of IR in the study. Furthermore, substantial changes to management information systems, with associated costs, would be required by companies to satisfy the requirements of the report content. The study revealed that the anticipated benefit of a company reconsidering its business model and encouraging sustainable product development is not perceived to be a material outcome in companies that implement IR, nor is assessing economic value creation and strategy considered a key motive for companies to compile an integrated report.Research limitations/implications - Further validation of the survey by statistical methods in addition to the pre-trial of the survey was not considered viable by the statistician in view of the limited amount of data. This may be viewed as a potential limitation of the study. Statistical analysis must also be interpreted with caution given the limited amount of data available for analysis. Other limitations include the fact that certain industries are too heavily represented instead of there being a mix of industries representing the entire market listed on the JSE, and that a substantial proportion of thecompanies are large listed companies and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Constituents. As a result, the results may not be representative of the overall market listed on the JSE.Practical implications - Managers are more motivated by the legitimising aspect of advancing corporate reputation and stakeholder needs in compiling the integrated report than satisfying investor needs, while the intended audience of the report in the framework is the providers of financial capital. This needs to be considered in the future development of regulations and frameworks. Furthermore, policymakers and regulators should exercise caution in the early stages of IR, when there is still a lack of evidence to support significant short-term changes in reconsidering the business model as well as sustainable product development that could be convincingly attributed to mandatory IR. It is, therefore, critical that policymakers, government and regulators strive towards creating a wider enabling environment to advance sustainable product development and sustainable business models. This can include establishing incentives to encourage the development of sustainable products, or other incentives that serve to align business objectives with national and global objectives and frameworks. Industry bodies can play a significant role in developing universal industry standards in this regard. Consideration should further be given to implementing regulatory mechanisms for advancing and possibly enforcing responsible investment practices as a measure to fully engage business in the critical shift towards sustainable business practices.Originality/value - The study is significant from a global perspective because IR and integrated thinking form a new and globally developing concept and the potential benefits and expected outcomes from an organisational perspective thereof for companies are currently the subject of continued global debate. This study aims to provide valuable insights into and understanding of the perceived organisational benefits of implementing IR requirements, as well as serves to highlight the challenge areas experienced in South African companies by compliance with IR requirements. The study also contributes towards the debate of motives of managers for producing an integrated report and how this will affect future directions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Benefits of integrated reporting; Integrated reporting; Integrated thinking; Motives for corporate reporting and disclosures; Sustainable business practices; Sustainable capitalism",,"Steyn, M.; Department of Management Accounting, University of South Africa (UNISA)South Africa",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20408021,,,,"English","Sustainability Account.

However, despite external environmental pressures commonly regarded as one of the main drivers of business model evolution, there is a lack of studies that explore business model innovation as a result of multiple stakeholder influences. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to examine the changing university business model within a region of the United Kingdom, using a stakeholder perspective that will aid theoretical development and refinement in both the business model and stakeholder fields. This examination is aided by consideration of the university business model as an activity system. Repeat interviews, combined with stakeholder theory, have been used to show how the changing university business model-stakeholder relationship has progressed through different stakeholder stages with resultant changes in content, structure and governance. Furthermore, conflicting objectives between each of the stakeholder groups (i.e. academics, industry liaison staff, technology transfer office staff and government support agency representatives) have led to the university business model evolving not as a process of co-creation but rather in a series of transitions whereby multiple stakeholders are continually shaping the university business model through strategies that are dependent upon their salience. Finally, this paper contributes to the development and refinement of business model innovation research, in that the use of stakeholder constructs can illustrate the impact of multiple stakeholders' power and influence on business model innovation. © 2014 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00336807,,,,"English","R D Manage.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900820209

Design/methodology/approach: Through a meta-theoretical analysis in which theories themselves become the unit of creative synthesis, a wider framework is developed to allow a comprehensive and nuanced reinterpretation of the neo-institutional theory and the resource-based view. In focus is the practical utility and relevance of such theories within emerging economies where pharmaceutical firms respond to market and institutional changes. Findings: The imperative for organizational change is very much dependent on the combination of ethically constrained managerial choices as well as entropic institutional pressures that allow firms to successfully adapt to their dynamic environment. This is achieved through legitimization and sustained competitive advantage, the results of innovation and contextually relevant differentiated value propositions. Social implications: Contrary to popular perceptions, recent developments demonstrate that the simultaneous pursuit of efficiency and ethical preferences is possible, irrespective of the institutional matrix within which change occurs. Managers should, therefore, tap into the niche opportunities offered by favorable entropic pressures. Originality/value: The novelty in this paper is the framework it provides for analyzing the massive role played by the micro-political power of managers and how the goals they pursue become fundamental to what the organization becomes as it coevolves with the turbulent era of emergent health needs. 4, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited,.","Constrained optimization; Corporate responsibility; Dynamic capabilities; Institutional matrix; Pharmaceutical industry; Strategic renewal",,"Ahen, F.; Department of Marketing and International Business, Turku School of Economics, University of TurkuFinland",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17471117,,,,"English","Soc.

The most common resource combination comprises equity, research and development cooperation, networks, industry knowledge and reputation. Except for financial capital in the form of equity, which appears a necessary condition for responsible innovation from SMEs, resource needs vary between technological and business model innovations. Creating business model innovations appears to be possible with scarce resources, at the very least with equity and social capital.

As an alternative, private regulation, developed and administered by companies, industry associations, and nongovernmental organizations, has emerged to safeguard economic, environmental, and social sustainability in producer countries and along the value chain. The academic literature on private regulation in global value chains has grown over the last decade, but currently few major reviews of the research have been undertaken. This paper examines peer-reviewed research in the relevant disciplines published in academic journals up to December 2011. Our goal is to identify and classify the topics and theories in the global value chain literature. We conclude that the number of articles explicitly examining private regulation, in a global value chain context, is relatively small when considering the importance and growth of these chains in the world’s economy. We also conclude that agriculture, forestry, and apparel manufacturing are the most often studied economic sectors; in contrast, other sectors, such as the information, communication and technology, with their complex global value chains, and often problematic environmental and social conditions, are understudied. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate responsibility; Ethical trade; Global value chains; Private regulation; Sustainability",,"Wahl, A.; Department of Forest Resources Management, University of British ColumbiaCanada",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

It includes extensive interviews with two of the bank's cofounders, who served as the bank's leaders for more than 37 years.Findings: The case study has identified six key enabling factors for social innovation: (1) a social purpose that is deeply, and effectively, embedded in the organization's mission, strategy, and operations; (2) an ownership structure to support the social mission and a structure (e.g., bank holding company) that facilitates social innovation; (3) capital capacity - that is, ability to create credit through leverage; (4) a deep level of knowledge about the business, the clientele, and the operating environment; (5) talented people who bring both skill and passion for the mission to the institution-building process; and (6) the discipline to continuously innovate, at a scale appropriate to the problem, with resources that are adequate to the challenge.Limitations: This work has several limitations including a focus on one U.S. bank holding company, and based on interviews with that bank's cofounders.Social implications: The chapter provides a rich description of how social innovation through social investment created a meaningful social impact. Important lessons and useful recommendations are drawn for social enterprises that are committed to social innovation in the financial services industry.Originality: The chapter provides insights into the ShoreBank case based on a unique set of data.

Following the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in 2010, BP plc. was accused of having set new records in the degree of divergence between its actual operations and what it had been communicating with regard to corporate responsibility. Its legitimacy crisis is here to be appraised as a case study in the discrepancy between symbolic and substantive strategies in corporate greening and its communication. A narrative analysis of BP's ""beyond petroleum""-rebranding and the ""making this right""-campaign issued in response to the Gulf of Mexico disaster discusses their respective implications for (green) corporate change. Further, the question is addressed why BP's green image endeavors were so widely accepted at first, only to find themselves dismissed as corporate greenwashing now. The study concludes that where a corporation's ""green narrative"" consistently evokes established narratives, its legitimacy will be judged against narrative, rather than empirical truth. Thus, the narrative will be more willingly accepted as speaking for the issuing company's legitimacy, irrespective of whether it reflects substantive greening or not. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","BP; Corporate communication; Corporate environmental responsibility; Image crisis; Impression management; Narrative analysis",,"Matejek, S.; International Business, DHBW Mannheim, Coblitzallee, 1-9, 68163 Mannheim, Germany; email: matejek@dhbw-mannheim.de",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674544,,,,"English","J.

The Italian experience on the development and adoption of harmonised indicators is considered here as an example of problems and possible solutions. Design/methodology/approach-Preliminary analysis shows that, in the Italian situation, two main gaps exist. The first one relates to the incomplete statistical information on the magnitude and performance of TSOs; the second is related to the lack of a set of harmonised indicators. To address these problems, two initiatives have been recently set up in Italy. On the one hand, the newly presented “National Strategy on Social Corporate Responsibility-2012-2014” has been oriented to fill the statistical gap, by extending the compilation of socio-economic and environmental accounts to TSOs; on the other hand, a joint initiative of the Italian Statistical Institute and the CSR Manager Network Italia towards the harmonisation of the “Global Reporting Initiatives-quantitative performance indicators” and the standards of the Italian statistical system. Within the second initiative, a specific sub-set of performance indicators for TSOs is proposed and presented in this paper. Findings-The Italian experiences reported here, together with the set of proposed indicators, can be used to improve data collection and to move towards a common framework for performance evaluation in the TSOs.

An analysis of these failures reveals that they fall into only a couple of categories that reflect how organizations partner, communicate, synthesize, or make decisions. The results prompt a redefining of information sharing to capture these broader system notions, furthermore provides a foundation for identifying and explaining historic forms of collaboration that have led to both failures and successes. This paper also reviews the common information sharing safeguards that lead to shared understanding and collaborative outcomes. We map these safeguards against the failures for developing collaboration strategies, and classify them according to six basic systems engineering categories of governance, processes, operations, acceptance, performance measurement, and resource management.

These are almost all normative and rationalist and focussed on structured decision contexts. Some exceptions seek to address unstructured decision contexts via Complex Adaptive Systems or Soft Systems Methodology. Meanwhile, a second set, around 16 per cent, comes from business ethics and are empirical, behavioural decision research. Although this set does not explicitly refer to DT, the empirical evidence here supports Keeney’s value-focussed analysis.Research limitations/implications - There is potential for theory building in SSCM using DT, but the research only addresses SSCM research (including corporate responsibility and ethics) and not DT in SCM or wider sustainable development research.Practical implications - Use of particular decision analysis methods for SSCM may be improved by better understanding different decision contexts.Social implications - The research shows potential synthesis with ethical DT absent from DT and SCM research.Originality/value - Empirical behavioural decision analysis for SSCM is considered alongside normative, rational analysis for the first time. Value-focussed DT appears useful for unstructured decision contexts found in SSCM.Originality/value - Empirical, behavioural decision analysis for SSCM is considered alongside normative rational analysis for the first time.

The case study findings indicate that a PPP makes the stakeholder environment more complex to manage, due to the increasing importance of the stakeholder context and dynamics. Hence, allocating stakeholder responsibilities between the public initiator and private consortium becomes problematic as it goes hand in hand with balancing between reactive and proactive responses to stakeholder claims.

It is based on a literature review, multidisciplinary academic meetings, interviews with SC directors of two global companies operating in a reputation-sensitive environment, and desk analysis of companies' documental flows. Findings reveal that communication accomplishes four basic functions: 1) it helps embedding and spreading cultural values along internal SC units; 2) it supports conflict resolution and compensation among different managerial logics; 3) it encourages development and maintenance of relationships with SC partners; 4) it enhances the fine-tuning among SC phases and activities, supporting alignment and integration of procedures and routines. Finally, the study points out that communication is typically face-to-face when it has to support the strategic SC phases, whereas it is typically computer-mediated when supporting SC operational phases.

Yet, some firms are successful with an arms-length approach to stakeholder management, based on bargaining power rather than fairness. We address this puzzle by relaxing the assumption that all stakeholders care about fairness. Empirical evidence from behavioral economics and social psychology suggests that firms face a population of potential stakeholders that consists not only of so-called 'reciprocators,' who do care about fairness, but also of self-regarding stakeholders, who do not. We propose that a fairness approach is more effective in attracting, retaining, and motivating reciprocal stakeholders to create value, while an arms-length approach is more effective in motivating self-regarding stakeholders and in attracting and retaining self-regarding stakeholders with high bargaining power.

Specifically, its objectives are to understand how event organisers manage relationships with multiple delivery partners, what tools and practices are used to ensure consistency and what risks and benefits exist.Design/methodology/approach– An applied, qualitative, exploratory method used thematic analysis to obtain findings from seven semi-structured interviews of senior managers involved in five international sports event held in Australasia.Findings– Findings were interpreted into nine themes related to event delivery partnerships such as reducing inconsistency, localising delivery through specialists, managing stakeholder relationships, managing workloads and taking an athlete-centred approach. Recommendations include establishing relationship strategies for each partner, determining the degree of control over delivery, crafting contracts appropriate to each partner, creating a suite of tools to aid consistency, recruiting an executive team with Games/mass participation event experience and a senior management team with sport or venue operations experience, centralising knowledge and planning, up-skilling partners as necessary and fully engaging local communities.Research limitations/implications– The sample was restricted to five event organisations and only a small number of participants per organisation were interviewed.

However, the tendency to explore business-conflict linkage largely from a business perspective and to see conflict as an ""incidence"" that business has to respond to, as opposed to a ""dynamic process"" that is a function of the breakdown of stakeholder relationship, limits our understanding of the relationship between business and conflict. Focusing on the Niger Delta in Nigeria, it is argued that the contradictory tension inherent in the peace making efforts of oil MNCs and the nature of their core business activities (i.e., oil extraction) limits the incentives and undermines the capacity of oil MNCs to be peace makers.Originality/value: The chapter contributes a critical perspective to the literature on business and conflict informed by nearly two decades of empirical research undertaken by the author in Africa. It analyzes how contextual factors in resource-rich African countries, previously neglected in the literature, influence both the willingness and ability of business to contribute to peace. It concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical implications for the role of business in conflict zones.

ICT is the technology required for information processing which facilitates data processing, information sharing, communication, searching and selection. This paper concentrates on the Abernathy and Clark model and its usefulness in applying ICT as innovative in managing ST. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was administered to destination managers and to eTourism experts. Destination managers were selected as they were identified as the person responsible for the overall management of a Destination Management Organisation. eTourism experts were identified as someone who possesses special expertise, knowledge and skills on ICT applications to tourism and offered expertise on which ranged from such areas as electronic distribution, recommender systems, user-generated content, online communities, mobile technology, technology acceptance, tourism networks and Web 2.0. This was followed by semi-structured interviews. Findings: These ICT tools were found to be innovative for information management and distribution for critical decision-making. Innovation was fostered through the use of ICT for ST by leading to a better understanding of the tourism product, monitoring, measuring and evaluating, forecasting trends, developing partnerships and engaging and supporting stakeholder relationships. ICT would provide novel ways of approaching marketing, energy monitoring, waste management, and communication for destinations.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual paper that suggests the need to rethink the role of marketing in the strategic decision making of companies. The study accesses recent theories of marketing, service and value and provides illustrative case examples. Findings: Consumers are progressively more active and the traditional supplier role of controlling consumers is less viable. The case examples show the variety of ways in which companies may adopt a new role in relation to customers and the market. The paper argues that adapting to this role change needs to take place at the highest level in the company and is the way to reinvent marketing strategy. This also necessitates marketing employing unconventional methodologies and relevant theory to address the complexity and ambiguity of current markets. Research limitations/implications: The paper is a conceptual paper restricted to supplier and customer roles, albeit set in a broader context of stakeholders.

Design/methodology/approach – An example of mapping and identifying expectations is presented as a result of a thematic analysis of qualitative interview data, collected from six stakeholder groups of the media industry. Findings – Expectation types and gaps can be identified through the use of systematic expectation mapping, conceptualized in this paper as “expectation management.” Expectation management analyzes expectation types and priorities, and it assists in crafting response strategies. Four types of expectations (must, will, should, and could) were identified in an empirical study of the media industry. Research limitations/implications – As the empirical study focussed on one industry in one country, the findings should be considered an introduction to expectation mapping and expectation management, to be further developed in other settings. Practical implications – Organizations can gain strategic advantages by using expectation management to deepen communication management. New skills and processes may be needed to enable communication professionals to analyze and understand the core level of expectations. Social implications – Expectation management can help organizations respond to current societal pressures and help publics voice their concerns toward organizations.

It compares experiences in Canada, Australia and the US with conversations carried out in a UK university in 2012 (after the UK fee rise). Design/methodology/approach – The research was informed by Burns Systemic Action research (2007), following emerging lines of enquiry and responding to resonance in these. It brings together conversations held with new undergraduates, second and third year students and staff tasked with introducing engagement into the curriculum. Findings – Findings indicate that student expectations are heavily influenced by secondary schooling and a target-driven consumer culture but that change has been gradual over a number of years. Alongside wanting “value for money” and “a good social life and a good degree” students are heavily motivated by experience and keen to be challenged. Research limitations/implications – Because of the research approach, the research results may lack generalisability. Practical implications – By comparing banking or transactional approaches to teaching and learning with critical pedagogy this paper hopes to highlight the importance of opening up rather than closing down opportunities for social engagement and experiential learning. Social implications – This paper makes a plea for social engagement that properly responds to the needs of communities resisting market-driven forces that treat students as consumers and expecting more rather than less from them in return.

Although there is some existing research on volunteer sport coaches and their role in community engagement, the research base is fragmented and is limited, primarily, to the national contexts of North America and Australia. This paper reports the findings of a systematic analysis of the international research evidence that supports claims for a wider social role for volunteer sports coaches. The analysis suggests that the evidence base for such claims is weak, lacking robustness, rigour, and a clear theoretical foundation. If, therefore, there are growing expectations about the individual and community benefits that volunteer sports coaches can deliver through sports activities, we argue that it is imperative to understand more about the needs, motivations, and priorities of this large volunteer workforce.

These spaces often host socio-ecological formations and functions that are both irregular and unexpected in urban settings, rendered invisible by the disciplining of modern Western aesthetic expectations concerning what is desirable and appropriate in cities. These lands may be vacant, but they are not uninhabited. They enable forms of inhabitation that disrupt the logic of urban development and provide social and ecological prospects otherwise unavailable in cities. The concept of terrain vague is engaged in this paper to probe vacant lands as interstitial spaces that are peripheral to mainstream, dominant urban experiences in Paris, France. The case of the Petite Ceinture railway encircling Paris is explored as an outstanding example of terrain that is rendered physically, socially and ecologically invisible yet provides astounding ecological connectivity and relatively undisturbed habitat for countless species in the midst of one of the world's cultural capitals. It enables alternate experiences of urbanity for many people, including different types of mobility, novel aesthetic encounters, and social engagement outside urban surveillance infrastructure. As the Petite Ceinture provides unique home for wildlife populations such as mid-size mammals and rare bat colonies, it also hosts undocumented migrant groups, assemblages of youth, urban flaneurs, homeless labourers, artists, and groups conducting prohibited activities. These types of inhabitations are possible because the Petite Ceinture has been fully decommissioned since 1993, unmanaged and left largely to successional processes. This paper investigates terrain vague as a critical dimension of urban sustainability and ends by suggesting key ways that the conceptual and material underpinnings of terrain vague could be channeled through progressive urban planning and design. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Abandoned railway; Paris; Urban sustainability; Vacancy","environmental protection; sustainability; terrain; urban design; urban development; urban planning; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; Mammalia","Foster, J.; Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University, 4700 Keele St., Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; email: jfoster@yorku.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",02642751,,,,"English","Cities",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901825072
