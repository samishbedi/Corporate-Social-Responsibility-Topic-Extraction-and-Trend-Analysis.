Business can argue that the charges are unjustified or it can accept the challenge. The authors gathered data from a sample of major U.S. corporations concerning their activities in the area of social responsibility. All of the responding firms were engaged in some form of effort. The research includes data on the kinds of activities and their success, relates activity to company size, summarizes the shareholders' viewpoint, and describes future plans. The findings are designed to function as a benchmark and guide to management already active and to those planning programs in this area. © 1973.",,,,,,00076813,,BHORA,,"English","Bus.

The authors have gathered data from a cross section of major corporations currently showing interest in social responsibility in an attempt to deal with the organizational aspect of this work and with some biographical dimensions of the officers themselves. The findings indicate, for example, that most of the positions were established after 1968 and rank high in the organization, and that their holders report directly to the chief executive. All the officers seem to be mature, experienced, and highly educated and trained individuals, skilled in external relations. © 1973.",,,,,,00076813,,BHORA,,"English","Bus.

However, some observers [1,8,12] believe that executives have become less interested in social responsibilities and more disillusioned by the results of the social-responsibility era. The apparent change in executives' attitudes leads to several questions that need answering: Has corporate experimentation with social programs convinced managers that the pursuit of social responsibility is basically inimical to the quest for profits? Is the business community's commitment to the philosophy of corporate social responsibility moribund? Is the idea destined to die of benign neglect? Conclusions pertaining to these questions are developed in this article. The analysis includes the formulation of a theoretical basis for evaluating and resolving the central issues which confound executive decision making as it relates to corporate social responsibility. © 1976.",,,"Shanklin, W.L.; Western Kentucky UniversityUnited States",,,01482963,,JBRED,,"English","J.
