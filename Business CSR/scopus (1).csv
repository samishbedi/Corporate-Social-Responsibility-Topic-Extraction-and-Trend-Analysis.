We find that shareholder proposal activism reduces CSP. We infer that rather than pressuring firms to improve CSP, activism may engender diversion of resources away from CSP into political activities used by managers to resist external pressures and retain discretion. We also find that managers are more likely to settle proposals filed by 'salient' shareholders (i.e., those with power, legitimacy, and urgency). Settlement with salient shareholders, however, also reduces CSP, suggesting that managers' responses are symbolic; i.e., they settle with salient shareholders to demonstrate conformance but continue to resist making the substantive changes to core policies that may compromise their discretion.

We argue for modifying the prevailing focus on corporate responsibility to stakeholders, and giving more serious attention to the importance of stakeholder responsibility - to firms, and to other stakeholders who are part of the collective enterprise. We elaborate why stakeholder responsibility matters, and suggest how making stakeholder responsibility a central focus of academics and practitioners can redefine the interaction between firms and stakeholders and ultimately enhance business excellence. © 2007.

Presentation of the potential impact of corporate social performance on firm financial performance follows, including investor characteristics, the rationale behind their choices, and their influence on the marketplace for securities worldwide. The unique method used to select socially responsible investments is then provided that also includes a description of the quantitative techniques employed in the analyses.

Growing tired of what are, in their eyes, inefficient and unproductive cross-sectoral partnerships, firms are starting to form post-cross-sectoral partnerships (post-partnerships') open exclusively to corporations. This paper examines one such post-partnership project, the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), to analyse the possibility of post-partnerships establishing stable definitions of corporate responsibility'. We do this by creating a theoretical framework based on actor-network theory (ANT) and institutional theory. Using this framework, we show that post-partnerships suffer from the paradox of striving to marginalise those stakeholders whose support they need for establishing stable definitions of corporate responsibility'. We conclude by discussing whether or not post-partnership strategies, despite this paradox, can be expected to establish stable definitions of corporate responsibility'. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Actor-network theory (ANT); Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI); Codes of conduct; Corporate responsibility; Garment industry; Institutional theory; Partnership; Supplier relations",

Unfortunately, several features of federal criminal law and federal law enforcement policy have driven a wedge into this alignment, forcing managers to choose between their ethical obligations and their obligation to obey the law or aid law enforcement. In this article, I examine the nature and implications of the growing divergence between managers' ethical and legal obligations. After describing the traditional approach to business ethics analysis, I identify the features of federal criminal law and law enforcement policy that are responsible for the divergence and show how they are undermining the efficacy of the traditional approach. I illustrate this effect with the issue of workplace confidentiality. I then argue that the traditional approach must be reformed to give explicit recognition to the legal dimension of normative analysis, and demonstrate how such a reformed approach would function by applying it to three illustrative issues - organizational justice, privacy, and ethical auditing - and supplying a case study - KPMG's allegedly abusive tax shelters. © 2007.

Defined as a disposition toward cleverness in crafting morally excellent responses to, or in anticipation of, challenging particularities, practical wisdom has four psychological components: knowledge, emotion, thinking, and motivation. People's experience, reflection, and inspiration are theorized to determine their capacity for practical wisdom-related performance. Enhanced by their abilities to engage in moral imagination, systems thinking, and ethical reframing, this capacity is realized in the form of wisdom-related performance. This can be manifested either in wise business decisions or through their performance as mentors, advice givers, or dispute handlers. © 2007. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

The organizing process and the multicultural setting of the international joint venture emphasize the actions of and interactions between individuals from various organizations. The IJV-managers' use of their social relationships in business organizing is explored through analysis of narratives of IJV-managers in a longitudinal single case to provide empirically grounded theory. From the in-depth interviews with IJV-managers the business relationships are identified as characterized by four possible levels of interpersonal relationships whose type influences the functions of the relationships and visa versa. One business relationship may contain only one or many of these interpersonal levels and an effective business relationship contains the appropriate interpersonal level for the business issue at hand. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: To reach this purpose, experiences and problems from the past are described and corporate sustainability as a new frame discussed. Findings: Many attempts to imitate the ""Japanese Way"" in Western companies failed, because they were only using some instruments (often focused on product quality) and not understanding the necessity of a fundamental change of culture. Globalization and international competition lead to the introduction of National Quality Awards and their use by a growing number of companies. But the term of ""quality"" was not promoting these concepts, therefore all international award models do not use the term quality any longer. And as TQM has also been driven by consultants, many companies gave up this approach. As the contents of TQM are still a necessity for any organization, one has to look for a new headline representing identical contents. Using, e.g. the early ISO definition of TQM one can see that sustainable success has been related to a stakeholder approach. Therefore, corporate sustainability based on a stakeholder approach would be a future-oriented concept to replace the name of TQM - but not the content. Originality/value: This paper shows a new - or until now not extensively discussed - perspective for the understanding of TQM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate strategy; Stakeholder analysis; Sustainable development; Total quality management",

In this study we examined Hart's three interlinking strategies of pollution prevention, product stewardship and sustainable development, and sought to test whether the resources for their implementation must be accumulated sequentially or whether they can be accumulated in parallel. The case study revealed that Patagonia has made significant progress, and continues to make progress, in each of these three areas. The results also suggested that the company's progress in one area has not necessarily been dependent on progress in another. While acknowledging the limitations of a single case study, we conclude that Patagonia's experience offers strong support for the notion that the resources for implementing strategies towards sustainable development can be accumulated in parallel - as opposed to sequentially.

Using this as a motivation, we examine the performance and risk sensitivities of Canadian ethical mutual funds vis-à-vis their conventional peers. In order to overcome the methodological deficiencies most prior papers suffered from, we use performance measurement approaches in the spirit of Carhart (1997, Journal of Finance 52(1): 57-82) and Ferson and Schadt (1996, Journal of Finance 51(2): 425-461). In doing so, we investigate the aggregated performance and investment style of ethical and conventional mutual funds and allow for time variation in the funds' systematic risk. Our Canadian evidence supports the conjecture that any performance differential between ethical mutual funds and their conventional peers is statistically insignificant. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Business ethics; Ethical mutual funds; Mutual fund performance; Performance measurement; Socially responsible investing (SRI)",

Especially Ulrich's notion of boundary critique, by which he focuses on stakeholder roles and particularly the role of 'the affected', seems a fruitful contribution. By adapting the role definitions towards a project context, including project dynamics, and adding operating instructions, a method has been developed that can be used for actual stakeholder identification in organizational projects. This method is demonstrated on two projects. The results show that this adapted version of boundary critique, which in its original form mainly is used in the context of civil society, is also relevant in an organizational profit-based context.

We discuss coercive and enabling control as variations that help account for the distinction between compliance-based ethics programs and values-based ethics programs.

Against Jensen's account, this paper argues that choosing the alternative that is at least as good as other alternatives need not preclude managers from respecting considerations in addition to long-run market value.

It should also lead us to doubt those who call for MNEs to voluntarily improve working conditions, at least when their arguments are based on the claim that workers have a moral right to such improvement.

Kasky both sides argued that their standard for distinguishing commercial speech from political speech would create the better policy for ensuring accurate and complete disclosure of social information by corporations. Using insights from information economics, we argue that neither standard will achieve the policy goal of optimal truthful disclosure. Instead, we argue that the appropriate standard is one of optimal truthful disclosure - balancing the value of speech against the costs of misinformation. Specifically, we argue that an SEC-sanctioned safe harbor available under a closely supervised system for social reporting will bring about optimal truthful disclosure. The scheme is intended to enhance stakeholder confidence in corporate social and political commentary, while at the same time encouraging corporations to provide accurate information in a fair playing field of public debate. © 2007.

Most ethicists agree that corporate executives owe their investors the duties of loyalty, candor, and care. These fiduciary duties undergird the promises made to shareholders at the time of incorporation, placing on executives moral obligations to engage in fair dealing and to avoid conflicts of interest. We concur that executives owe all of their existing shareholders both promise-keeping and fiduciary duties and argue that some corporate executives violate these responsibilities by attempting to withhold information from or limit information to some shareholders while courting others. We analyze the ethical implications of six techniques and tools that executives use to attract certain types of shareholders while deterring others.

We found, however, an unexpected, positive feature of decoupling in the study of a local government; namely, when organizational members engage in discussions that turn away from the letter of an ethics code they often do so to address higher ethical principles embedded in the spirit of the code. The decoupled understanding of the code in these cases becomes a symbolic, legitimating gesture grounded not in strict provisions but in creative and complex interactions. This counterintuitive explanation of decoupling capitalizes on discourse that evolves from a legalistic interpretation to rich discussions that value the multiplicity of voices within organizational life. What follows is that ethical decision making emerges as creative, dynamic, and responsive to its constituents. © 2007. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Recent legislative developments like Sarbanes-Oxley attempt to enhance accountability in the business environment through the employment of checks and balances and the threat of individual liability. This kind of legalistic strategy still seems to assume the existence of an individual agent who employs moral principles to come to decisions in a deliberate, impartial manner. This paper will emphasize that moral decision-making often does not take place in this manner, but is rather a tacit process of sensing what the appropriate behavior would be. Accountability, both with respect to individuals and organizations, is less a matter of ""accounting for"" a set of concrete assets, than a question of being accountable to a set of internal and external stakeholders, or in terms of the tacit sense of moral propriety that develops among business associates and colleagues over time. © 2007.

The recent scandals at Enron and other corporations were due, in part, to failures by gatekeeper institutions. However, intermediaries exist primarily to provide for-fee services and not specifically to detect and deter misconduct. Insofar as these institutions are gatekeepers or guardians, they serve reluctantly. Hence the question: What is the responsibility of intermediaries to act as gatekeepers? This article argues that the appropriate moral, as well as legal, principle for justifying responsibility in a gatekeeper role is cost effectiveness. This conclusion is reached by means of a hypothetical exercise called the investors' bargain in which investors - who bear the costs and receive the benefits of intermediaries' gatekeeper role - are asked to choose the best means of protecting their interests. © 2007.

The legal discussion examines disclosure regulations, employment restrictions, bribery laws, and anti-fraud provisions as each applies to the lobbying context. The analysis demonstrates that given the social value placed on the First Amendment, federal law generally affords lobbyists wide latitude in determining who, what, when, where, and how to lobby. The article then turns to ethics. Lobbying involves deliberate attempts to effect changes in the law. An argument is advanced that because law implicates the use of force and because law ideally reflects the values of a democratic society, seeking to slant the law to serve a client's narrow interests cannot provide an adequate ethical end for a lobbyist. On the contrary, a lobbyist has an affirmative moral duty to seek reasonably balanced and just laws. The article examines, refines, and defends this proposition in a number of settings. © 2007.

In this article, we argue that viewing loyalty as a cognitive phenomenon - an attitude that resides in the mind of the individual - helps to clarify definitional inconsistencies, provides a finer-grained analysis of the concept, and sheds additional light on the ethical implications of loyalty in organizations. Specifically, we adopt the psychological contract perspective to analyze loyalty's cognitive dimensions, and treat loyalty as an individual-level construction of perceived reciprocal obligations. Based upon this perspective, we present a three-tiered framework of loyalty that provides a psychologically informed definition of the concept, specifies the variety of obligation types that loyalty can imply, and anticipates the potential for asymmetrical loyalty configurations between employers and employees. We use the framework to articulate moral issues associated with both symmetrical and asymmetrical loyalty configurations and discuss the implications of the framework for theory and practice. © 2007.

The hypernorm of ""necessary social efficiency"" is invoked to claim that the arguments made by Nike and various ""friends of the court"" in favor of greater protection for corporate speech are problematic.

Each reason suggests we exercise caution in conflating corporations and individuals as the law often does. First, raising the issue of corporate moral agency is important to the aim of providing a framework for ethically evaluating corporate speech. It is tempting to proceed as if the nature of corporate speech is self-evident. But this is hardly the case. Corporations are not natural persons, and we mustn't assume corporate speech is indistinguishable from human speech. Before we can ethically evaluate corporate speech, we must first clarify what corporate speech is. This requires an understanding of the fundamental nature of the corporate entity, including its moral status. Second, raising the issue of corporate moral agency is important if we wish to promote morally responsible corporate speech. Any diminished moral capacity on the corporation's part would suggest a core role for the strong legal reinforcement of any ethical aspirations here.

There is wide agreement that it mandates maximizing some kind of good, but many formulations also require a pattern of distribution. The most common of these take utilitarianism to characterize right acts as those that achieve ""the greatest good for the greatest number."" This paper shows important ambiguities in this formulation and contrasts it (on any plausible interpretation of it) with the kinds of utilitarian views actually defended by major proponents of utilitarianism. The aim is not to defend any of these views but to formulate them in a way that facilitates using them - or, more likely, some revised version suggested by the paper - in guiding decisions in business. The analysis provided here should also facilitate appraisal of utilitarianism, contribute to clarity in discussions of business ethics, and suggest a range of ethical standards that merit consideration for certain kinds of decision. If the results of the analysis are correct, a distributive reading of utilitarianism is at best misleading as a representation of its central thrust; it should not be described as the view that ethics calls for achieving ""the greatest good for the greatest number"": and, understood as its major proponents take it, utilitarianism differs more from Kantian ethics than distributive readings imply and is more difficult to defend than it appears to be when viewed as intrinsically distributive. © 2007.

In this paper, we consider the ethical and economic context that existed and facilitated Andersen's failure. Our analysis is grounded in Akerlof's (1970, Quarterly Journal of Economics August, 488-500) Theory of the Market for Lemons and we characterize the market for audit reports as a market for lemons. Consistent with Akerlof's model, we consider the appropriateness of the countervailing mechanisms that existed at the time of Andersen's demise that appeared to have effectively failed in counteracting Andersen's ethical shortcomings. Finally, we assess the appropriateness of the remedies proposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOA) to ensure that similar ethical lapses will not occur in the future. Our analysis indicates that the SOA regulatory reforms should counteract some of the necessary conditions of the Lemons Model, and thereby mitigate the likelihood of audit failures. However, we contend that the effectiveness of the SOA critically depends upon the focus and attention of the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) towards assessing the ethical climates of public accounting firms.

It suggests that these orientations could account for the weak sense of business responsibility and unethical behaviours reported in earlier works. To remedy this, the paper proposes the broadening of problem-solving methodologies so that both material and ethical/spiritual dimensions of business responsibility are given due consideration.

Design/methodology/ approach - A self-administered survey of a sample 300 Chinese managers with budgetary and personnel responsibilities in Tianjin, China was obtained for the purpose of the present study. A series of regression analyses were conducted to test the proposed relations. Findings - Results from the regression analyses provided partial confirmations for the proposed relationships. Idealism influenced perceptions of false promises, traditional competitive bargaining, and attacking an opponents' network. Perceptions of traditional competitive bargaining, attacking an opponent's network, and inappropriate information gathering were significantly influenced by relativism. Machiavellianism influenced perceptions of traditional competitive bargaining and misrepresentation of information. Research limitations/implications - Given the existing impediments to sampling and data collection in China, the sampling method used is non-probabilistic, which calls for consideration of the results as exploratory. The present study's sample is drawn from the Northeastern region of China and since ethical beliefs and orientation in China varies by region, the results of the present study cannot be generalized to the total population of China. Originality/value - The present study aims to provide the following contribution. First, as most studies in the negotiation ethics literature are focused in Western cultural contexts, this study attempts to fill this gap by investigating the negotiation ethical values of executives from Eastern culture. Second, global firms' executives can better understand the ethical mindset of their Chinese counterparts and utilize this knowledge to efficiently and effectively manage the negotiation process with their counterparts in this important market. Third, public policymakers and researchers can also benefit from this study by understanding the external validity and the degree of ethnocentrism of not only their own code of ethics but also the validity of a universal code of ethic. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; China; Negotiating",

Therefore, the objective of this paper is to introduce and describe a framework of classification and empirical illustration to provide insights into the strategic approaches of corporate code of ethics content within and across contextual business environments. Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes the content analysis of code prescription and the intensity of codification in the contents of 78 corporate codes of ethics in Australia. Findings - The paper finds that, generally, the studied corporate codes of ethics in Australia are of standardized and replicated strategic approaches. In particular, customized and individualized strategic approaches are far from penetrating the ethos of corporate codes of ethics content. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to Australian codes of ethics. Suggestions for further research are provided in terms of the search for best practice of customized and individualized corporate codes of ethics content across countries. Practical implications - The framework contributes to an identification of four strategic approaches of corporate codes of ethics content, namely standardized, replicated, individualized and customized. Originality/value - The principal contribution of this paper is a generic framework to identify strategic approaches of corporate codes of ethics content. The framework is derived from two generic dimensions: the context of application and the application of content. The timing of application is also a crucial generic dimension to the success or failure of codes of ethics content. Empirical illustrations based upon corporate codes of ethics in Australia's top companies underpin the topic explored. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Business ethics; Classification",

Design/methodology/approach - A historical analysis of the literature is carried out to identify the contribution of key features of the practice of confession and the reformation of the Church to the development of accountability in Protestant societies. Findings - The study highlights that the practice of confession is similar to accountability and the Catholic Church developed the emotion of guilt necessary for accountability. The Protestant Reformation provided for the further development of accountability to its modern form, through the restructuring of the practice of confession and the extension of the principles of accountability to itself. The conditions necessary for the practice of accountability such as popular power of the people, the concept of contracts and the emotion of guilt developed within the above environment.

Pressures for legitimacy at the institutional level suggest that firm age and size, along with industry shifts in stakeholder management, will increase the likelihood of changes in stakeholder management for the focal firm. The authors posit that organizational risk and performance will also affect the likelihood of change, as will managerial discretion, ownership, and succession.

Data from a five-year period revealed how costs associated with the strongest stakeholders (that is, with the greatest bargaining power) greatly increased relative to costs associated with weak stakeholders. The festival was also more able to increase its revenues from weak stakeholders than from those in strong bargaining positions. Conclusions are drawn on how this case confirms and elaborates upon theory, particularly by applying it to the festival sector. Management implications are also drawn on how festival organizations should manage relationships when they hold strong or weak positions relative to stakeholders.","Festival costs and revenues; Resource dependency; Stakeholder management","cost; festival; heritage tourism; stakeholder; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden"

The goal of this paper is to explicate one aspect of the debate between various attempts of offering a specific method for resolving moral dilemmas. We contrast two kinds of deliberative methods: deliberative methods whose goal is decision-making and deliberative methods that are aimed at gaining edifying perspectives. The decision-making methods assessed include the traditional moral theories like utilitarianism and Kantianism, as well as second order principles, such as principlism and specified principlism. In light of this assessment, we suggest taking a closer look at two perceptive models, casuistry and particularism. These models are used for dealing with moral dilemmas that provide for edifying perspectives rather than decision-making. These perceptive models, though less scientific and not as good at prescribing an action, are more human in the sense that they enrich our moral sensibilities and enhance our understanding of the meaning of the situation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Casuistry; Decision theory; Humanism; Moral deliberation; Particularism",

An important basis for this evaluation is stakeholder analysis. The approach is based upon established theory, knowledge of stakeholder management and empirical data. The analysis consists of a stakeholder impact index to determine the nature and impact of stakeholder influence, the probability of stakeholders exercising their influence and each stakeholder's position in relation to the project - are they proponents or opponents?

According to the IMP, when identifications and relevant behavioural or attitudinal outcomes address the same level of categorization, their relationship will be stronger. A study is presented with employees (n=281) matched to managers (n=101). Supporting the IMP, organizational identification (but not corporate identification) predicted customer-oriented behaviour on the level of the local organization, whereas corporate identification (but not organizational identification) predicted attitude toward corporate citizenship behaviour. Furthermore, multilevel analyses showed that these relationships were enhanced in organizations where managers displayed the respective behaviours themselves to a greater extent.

Past research suggests that factors such as gender, educational level, religiosity, and work experience may be related to the development of a person's ethical standards. This study attempts to do two things. First, the study provides a short review of contemporary ethical models, including the hermeneutical model. Second, the study examines factors affecting a person's ethical perspectives. Understanding the factors which shape the ethical standards of future accountants will help educational institutions develop appropriate ethics curriculum and help firms develop appropriate ethics training for their employees. Failure to bring appropriate ethical standards to the workplace will most assuredly hamper the profession's time-honored commitment to serve the public interest.

They are managed for the long run. Among the most durable and best performing family businesses, this long-run approach shows up as four priorities: continuity and persistence in pursuing a substantive rather than a financial mission, exceptional attention to the internal community of employees, unusually close connection to key external stakeholders, and courageous commanding leadership that resists pressures from shortsighted owners.

We identify four symbolic action categories that facilitate resource acquisition: conveying the entrepreneur's personal credibility, professional organizing, organizational achievement, and the quality of stakeholder relationships. Our data show that entrepreneurs who perform a variety of symbolic actions from these categories skillfully and frequently obtain more resources than those who do not. Our data also suggest three factors - structural similarity, intrinsic quality, and uncertainty - that moderate the relationship between symbolic management and resource acquisition.

Overall, we find no significant difference - even for a specific ""accounting tricks"" vignette, which resembles the Enron and WorldCom situations. We do find, however, that the practitioners were more accepting of vignettes that involved physical harm (PH) to individuals and those that were legal (but ethically questionable).

Originality/value - Improved feedback from the operative and maintenance phase has the potential to reduce total life cycle costs for future construction projects. Using Kim's OADI-SMM model of organisational learning, this paper applies a diagnostic instrument that focuses on the organisation's structural and cultural characteristics to identify breakdowns in experience transfer and learning. Awareness of the factors that inhibit experience transfer and learning can contribute to improving industry performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Construction industry; Knowledge transfer; Learning; Organizational structures","Construction industry; Life cycle; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Computer based management systems; Knowledge transfer; Organizational structures; Project management"

Design - Advances the view that, to many Victorian business people, corporate responsible behavior was implicit in how they undertook their business, but modern companies appear to have ""lost"" it, to such an extent that firms today are being encouraged to act in a corporately social manner. Highlights what has been lost and focuses on how to go about replacing it. Findings - Details the importance of: identifying the purpose and values of the business; helping employees to understand the company's policies and to ""live"" them at work; providing an effective means for employees to raise concerns that they have; and promulgating the values externally. Practical implications - Demonstrates that corporate social responsibility can enhance company reputation, which will usually feed through to the share price and lower costs of borrowing - all of which help the bottom line. Originality/value - Contends that employees in a company with high corporate social responsibility are able to feel proud of the organization, which in turn will lead to attracting quality staff and lower staff turnover.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes the form of a literature review, and analysis of the meaning of coercion, and supplier survey data. Findings - Reverse auctions, as commonly used, are shown to be fundamentally coercive, with coercion being essential for achieving the outcomes that buyers seek. Research limitations/implications - Survey responses and findings that can be drawn from them are limited due to the small sample size. Reflects the dyadic nature of buyers' corporate codes of conduct in relation to the day-to-day practice of purchasing and supply management. Practical implications - The existence of coercion indicates that reverse auctions are inconsistent with corporate codes of ethics or codes of conduct with respect to supplier relationships (e.g. fairness, honesty, and integrity). Reverse auctions are also shown to be inconsistent with US federal procurement standards and the Institute of Supply Management's ""Principles and standards of ethical supply management conduct"". Originality/value - The paper brings to the forefront the existence of psychological and economic coercion in the common use of reverse auctions, and discusses how this creates difficult problems for both buyers and sellers.

Whereas managers are considered as a source of conflicts by agency/shareholder theorists, they are often viewed as useful mediators in the stakeholder approach. This paper proposes an alternative theory on the role of management in corporate governance, the so-called short term salient stakeholder theory, and illustrates it with a longitudinal case study of Eurotunnel, the Channel Tunnel operator. When the firm's legitimate stakeholders have very different information levels and bargaining strengths, this theory predicts that (i) firms are governed in the interests of a unique stakeholder group (ii) managers have a minor role and are prone to collude with the most powerful interest group (iii) this autocratic type of governance is unstable in the long-term as the legitimate stakeholders expropriated at one period use influence strategies to gain power in the next period (iv) the chronic conflicts associated to short-term salient stakeholder management lead to poor organizational performance. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Two real-world cases that focus on accounting fraud as the ethical conception. Through these cases, we show that while accounting fraud - from a consequentialist perspective - may appear to provide a quick solution to a pressing problem, longer term effects of fraud and misconduct make ethical implications more apparent. Widely used compensation schemes also may have the tendency to fuel unethical behavior. We argue that an ethical reinvigoration of the business world can only be accomplished by encouraging the business realm to impose upon itself some measure of self-regulating along the lines of deontological ethics.

In doing so, it examines the nature of cooperation between the providers of healthcare services (hospitals) and those who commission and purchase healthcare on behalf of patients (regional health authorities) and makes specific recommendations as to how cooperation can be better realized. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a qualitative interview approach for gathering and analyzing major stakeholder (provider and purchaser) perceptions of their interorganizational relations and how these interactions impact on the quest of the healthcare provider to meet the needs of the community they serve. Findings: The paper identifies and groups relevant variables into four major themes or ""core categories"" that characterize purchaser-provider stakeholder cooperation. These themes represent provider and purchaser views on those factors characterising stakeholder relationships within the purchaser-provider dyad. This is followed by a number of suggestions as to how to improve the nature of cooperation between these stakeholders.

The book (HSM) offers many prescriptions for running contemporary state-of-the-art competitive enterprises in service of society: the normative principles of meso-level = business strategy and ethics. However, it also provides a very distinctive viewpoint on micro-level managerial ethics, as well as macro-level social and political systems. In the following section of this review, some of the main principles and tenets of HSM are described and briefly critiqued. Then (in Section 3) an augmentation of HSM is outlined. At that point, additional prescriptions for enterprise strategy are indicated in order to more fully accommodate the several known limitations of market based systems. The final section of the article then traces the historical context of the HSM thesis, seeing that if it is indeed ""not an ideology,"" as is claimed, it is certainly an informed and persuasive view from somewhere. © 2007 The authors.",,

Social theory concepts such as norm, value, belief, role, social relationship, and institution as well as game can be defined in a uniform way in terms of rules and rule complexes.

Practical implications are drawn for event managers regarding the identification, evaluation, and management of stakeholder relationships. Drawing on resource dependency and stakeholder theories, a conceptual model is presented that illustrates the conclusion that festivals and events are produced within and by a set of managed stakeholder relationships.

In the present context, marginal resources are defined as resources that providers can offer to events in periods when these resources cannot be put to productive use in their regular operations. Such marginal resources are often mobilized through networks of social relationships when the resource providers regard a connection to the public event as being valuable. The mobilization of marginal resources is analyzed using a network approach and by analyzing the motives of the participating resource providers. Cases involving two public events are presented in order to illustrate the mobilization and the development of patterns and routines over time. The cases indicate that resources are mainly mobilized through networking. Building and using the legitimacy of the event are important factors in this process. The actors providing resources are motivated by a mix of interests, but most of them have an idealistic interest in the event. The mobilized resources are combined in ways that create economy of scope and scale for the organizer. Over time, a recurring event benefits from experience and learned behavior among the actors involved. It seems to be easier to mobilize resources in a community where the actors, and clusters of actors, are well connected with each other. Copyright © 2007 Cognizant Comm.

Using interview data and document analysis, the authors show that the exercise of corporate social responsibility can be viewed in practice as a dynamic negotiation and an interaction between multiple actors.

Furthermore, we examine how discursively constituted practice relates to managerial subjectivity and the possibilities of managers being moral agents.

While bribery in the form of payments and gifts is prevalent, fraud does not appear to be as serious a problem. Most construction professionals believe that the industry suffers from unfair tendering practices, as well as over-claiming and/or withholding payment for service delivery. Negligence arises mainly from poor documentation and poor workmanship. Incidents of collusive tendering encompass cover pricing and bid cutting by contractors, while the primary form of fraudulent behaviour is deceit and misinformation.

To assess the incremental impact of each of these factors, a pooled time series, cross-sectional model was econometrically tested for 17 ECMS over the 1998-2002 time period. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a positive association between public governance, corporate transparency, and portfolio flows after controlling for other macroeconomic factors. The results suggest that good public governance and high accounting quality are important determinants of portfolio flows to ECMs. Finally, the paper establishes that while portfolio equity flows are significantly attracted to ECMs with strong democratic institutions, there is no significant association between portfolio bond flows and the presence of democratic institutions. © 2007 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College.",,

This distinction is of enormous importance for business ethics, since market transactions are governed by the competitive logic of the market, whereas administered transactions are subject to the cooperative norms that govern collective action in a bureaucracy. The widespread failure to distinguish between these two types of transactions, and thus to distinguish between adversarial and non-adversarial relations, has led many business ethicists to develop a ""uniform"" moral code. Yet in market transactions, the checks and balances built into the system of commercial exchange are such as to permit more instrumental forms of behavior. In administered transactions, by contrast, these checks and balances are absent, and thus the institutional context calls for much greater exercise of moral restraint. In this paper, I begin the task of developing an adversarial ethic for business. According to this view, the competitive environment licenses a greater range of ""self-interested"" behavior, but also imposes its own constraints on the strategies that firms may adopt in the pursuit of their interests. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Adversarial ethics; Competition; Corporate social responsibility; Market failure; Philosophy of sport",

Design/methodology/approach - Witha framework developed from the literature on cults and cult behavior as well as secondary research, the authors develop the perspective that Enron's senior leaders created an organization that encouraged executives to act in ways that were criminal. Five characteristics of cults: persuasion, isolation, elitism, charismatic (and dogmatic) leadership and wealth not benefiting group members were found to apply. Findings - The major differences between ahigh performance organization and a cult were transparency, accountability and dialogue. Practical implications - It highlights the small difference between a high performance culture and a cult and raises ""red flags"" or warning signs for executives to be aware of. Executives looking for long-term outstanding performance through high levels of social cohesion and strong behavioral norms need to be aware of the cult trap.

It draws on the fields of management, management accounting and critical accounting to present a case for further research engagement with sustainability accounting and accountability practice. Findings - The paper finds that the extant literature in the field of sustainability accounting and reporting, in contrast to the fields of management accounting and management, has largely ignored practice within organisations. The lack of ""engaging research"" is found to be due to concerns about increasing the breadth of participants in the social accounting agenda and ""managerial capture"".

Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal multiple-case study methodology was used in researching groups of five teachers in Australia and four teachers in the UK. The two groups independently participated in an initial face-to-face training day and then completed the professional development course via an online learning environment (Blackboard). The course was designed to facilitate community of practice cohesion. Data collection included surveys, data mining of online activity, discussion forums and e-mails, and semi-structured interviews. Findings: The paper finds that the participants of both case studies demonstrated sustained engagement for more than twice the minimum requirement. While the Australian case study was sustained through a community-defined regime of participation, the UK case study increasingly relied on the course facilitator to broker both practices and a community rhythm by which they could participate. Sustained participation in the Australian case study was supported by mutuality as seen in reciprocity of interaction and social engagement. Originality/value: Transformative professional development is dependent on a number of design principles, including that it needs to be sustained over time. The literature reveals that neither face-to-face nor online professional development, per se, sustains engagement.

Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a CSR disclosure checklist to measure the extent of CSR disclosure in annual reports and a multiple regression analysis to examine the association between ownership structure and the extent of CSR disclosure in annual reports. Findings - The paper finds that, even among the larger and actively traded stocks in Malaysia, there is considerable variability in the amount of social activities disclosed in corporate annual reports. Results from multiple regression analysis show that, consistent with expectations, companies in which the directors hold a higher proportion of equity shares (owner-managed companies) disclosed significantly less CSR information, while companies in which the government is a substantial shareholder disclosed significantly more CSR information in their annual reports. Research limitations/implications - The sample for this study comes from larger and actively traded stocks on the Bursa Malaysia. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to smaller and less actively traded stocks. Practical implications - The findings appear to suggest that the level of CSR disclosure in annual reports of companies depends on the extent of ""public pressure"" faced by each company. The results also raise the question of whether corporate involvement in social activities should be made a mandatory disclosure in annual reports to better assess the extent of ""corporate citizenship"" of Malaysian companies.

Design/methodology/approach - In the proposed network model, socially-responsible investment organizations (SRIOs) collaborate with corporations to enhance the flow of information through the network, providing a key focal point and filter for information to and from the various stakeholders of the corporation. Findings - Illustrations show SRIOs becoming a catalyst towards best practices, emphasizing strategic options, monitoring functions, benchmarking peer firms, and providing stronger linkages to the global environment. Research limitations/implications - The model is illustrated with anecdotal evidence. Practical implications - Utilizing SRIOs as intermediaries in the relationship between businesses and their multiple stakeholders is attractive because SRIOs possess the capabilities and skills of experts and matchmakers. The implications of increased access to information and greater valuation of corporate social responsibility are projected as a result of the SRIOs' role as expert, driving greater accountability with increased access to information. It is also seen as a direct result of the SRIOs' role as matchmaker, providing more explicit valuation of corporate social responsibility.

Specifically, this paper seeks to define conflict of interest and how it is manifested in both business and sport. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a conceptual discussion of the issue of conflict of interest as it relates to the management and governance of sports organizations. Relationships between business ethics, governance and sport management are examined in the quest to understand conflict of interest and its prevalence in and relevance to sport management. Findings - Conflicts of interest within the sport industry may have the same structural elements as those occurring in mainstream business, such as benefits, obligations and issues of trust, but it is the higher societal expectations and values placed on sport and sporting organizations that provide the key points of difference. Practical implications - Through collaboration with sport management practitioners, via inductive in-depth research, a clearer definition of conflict of interest and the range of situations in which it may occur can be developed. It is through a continued research effort in this area that sport managers will be better able to both identify and manage conflicts of interest as they occur. Originality/value - It is the lack of definitive examples or guidelines for recognition of an actual or a potential conflict of interest that appears to cause the greatest confusion within sport management. By drawing together the key concepts found within the extant literature, a clearer understanding of what constitutes a conflict of interest is provided by this paper. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Governance; Sports",

It is quite common to find studies that show a direct connection between stakeholder management and business success, especially with regard to financial success. However, this study, based on an in-depth case study on Campina, the second largest dairy company in the Netherlands, has its primary focus not on direct financial implications of stakeholder management, but on the impact proactive stakeholder management has on the interaction between companies and public authorities.

Follett holds that the manager has to accept standards which come from professional managerial associations. Additionally, Follett is aware of the contribution of business management to individual development, to the welfare and culture of society. She also presents a seminal approach to stakeholder theory.

This unique and innovative textbook is designed to encourage students and managers to confront those fundamental moral challenges, to develop skills in moral analysis and judgment, and to come to terms with their own definition of moral leadership and how it can be translated into action. Drawing on the inspiration of major literary and historical figures such as Machiavelli, Conrad, Shackleton and Achebe, and based upon an impressive array of literary sources, including novels, plays, history and biography, the book centers on four questions implicitly asked of all leaders: What is the nature of a moral challenge?. How do people 'reason morally'?. How do leaders contend with the moral choices they face?. How is moral leadership different from leadership in general?. The Moral Leader is based upon the renowned course of the same name taught at Harvard Business School for over two decades. With an emphasis on decision-making and action, students learn to identify moral problems, to address them systematically, and to develop skills that aid them throughout their studies and their professional lives. At times challenging, insightful, and always illuminating, this book is essential reading for all serious students of leadership, management, business ethics or policy. © 2008 Sandra J. Sucher.

This article demonstrates that CSP is institutionalised within the governance structure. We will attempt to make this clear by means of a description of the Dutch system of corporate governance. Under certain circumstances Dutch companies are already bound to CSP due to prevailing legislation. A governance perspective shows that CSP is institutionalised within a company's governance structure. ""Processes of responsiveness"", since long regarded as a starting point of CSP-analysis, appear to be decision-making processes. Within these processes the expectations of the stakeholders can be institutionalised, trust can be built and interests can be incorporated. This makes CSP context-dependent. However, it is possible to analyse companies by comparing the companies' individual governance structures. The article concludes that CSP-analysis can fruitfully extend into analysing in the role of the stakeholders in the influence-pathways that are incorporated within the governance structure. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate governance; Corporate social performance; Stakeholder influence",

However, the concept, aims and processes of upstream engagement remain ill-defined, are often misunderstood, and have undergone little critical analysis. This special issue of NanoEthics, entitled 'Engaging with Nanotechnologies-Engaging Differently?' takes a multi-nation, multi-case approach to explore this idea, drawing on work represented by four articles from the US and Europe, from ethnographic work in the nanotechnology lab through to analysis of a Citizens' Jury and other attempts to move public debate 'upstream'.

Design/methodology/approach - An examination of the literature and a review of best practices was undertaken to identify relevant performance measurements and indicators that could be utilized to measure incremental results and impacts related to poverty reduction strategies. Findings - Credible demonstration of policy or program impacts for poverty reduction are dependent on understanding the distinction between inputs, outputs, outcomes and indicators. Moreover, to be trusted by the public, performance reporting on poverty reduction needs to focus more selectively on identifying the key measures of performance and the engagement of key constituents.

The general ideas behind complex systems dynamics and evolution are presented and then two examples are treated in detail. The first in an evolutionary model of a market in which some new product is developed by competing firms and their ""task"" is to find a strategy in terms of quality and price that will be sustainable. This essentially requires agents/firms to discover mutually compatible strategies, and to create thereby sustainable market niches. The second example considers the internal structure of firms, in terms of their constituent working practices and skills. It demonstrates that it is precisely their ignorance of the consequences of adopting any particular practice that generates diversity in the emergent capabilities of firms, exploring the dimension of potential demand and therefore leading to a successful and sustainable business sector. The work supports the notion that the cognitive abilities that are involved are not about deduction and logic, as a traditional view of rationality might suggest, but are about the development and contraction of interpretive frameworks, which will be different for each player. The paper links these examples to a general recognition of the idea that complex, multi-agent systems evolve through successive ""structural attractors""-multi-dimensional dynamical systems-with temporary structural stability. Because real systems contain both the structure and deviations from it, then there is a constant probing of structural stability and the possibility of qualitative change to a new structural attractor. This resembles the ideas in biological evolution related to ""punctuated equilibria,"" but it also links this to the idea of emergent and evolving networks of interaction, never of course near thermodynamic equilibrium. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Cladistics; Co-evolution; Complexity; Interpretive frameworks; Market evolution; Multi-agent modelling; Structural attractors",

Design buffers involve building slack into a proven systems architecture to absorb foreseeable change requests. Choosing the appropriate amounts of reuse and slack is dependent on the uncertainty in the manufacturing technology over the infrastructure life cycle. While proven infrastructure designs can economically accommodate incremental changes in technology, adaptation costs escalate when sufficient buffers are not built-in and changes are radical. We uncover opposing stakeholder interests in determining the extent to which reuse or buffers are used. Design reuse is attractive to the client to reduce the risk that a facility fails to perform, but limits the designer's job to tedious customization work. Design buffers are attractive to the designer to do original problem-solving and limit the risks of being unresponsive to uncertainty, but not to the client who is not guaranteed that the investments will pay off. We find that inequalities between the two stakeholders in the governing power on design decision-making compound the difficulties in assessing and implementing the reuse versus buffers tradeoff. © 2007 IEEE.","Design buffers; Design reuse; Infrastructure development process; Project stakeholder management","Architectural design; Decision making; Economics; Life cycle; Problem solving; Structural design; Technology; Design buffer; Design reuse; Manufacturing technology; Project management"

This study examined travel motives as well as travel decision-making of Taiwanese travellers with a group package tour abroad. The qualitative approach - participant observation first and telephone interviews with tour participants later - was conducted for data collection. It was found that socio-psychological needs were an important motivation for travel, and socio-economic considerations were regarded as a crucial motivation for travel decision-making. Furthermore, their decision-makings are also strongly influenced by their social relationships - friends/relatives' recommendations. The results also revealed that Taiwanese travelers' travel motivations are considerably related to the price paid. The 'push factor' appeared to have much more impact than the 'pull factor' for impelling Taiwanese travelers in the pursuit of a holiday. Since the source of information for taking a vacation plays an important role for decision-making, this research suggested that the travel agency should put more efforts on nurturing a positive corporate image in order to gain consumers' trust.

However, failure to recognize that organizational capabilities involve complex and intricately woven underlying processes may lead to an incomplete understanding of how capabilities affect competitive advantage. As a means of understanding this underlying complexity, we discuss how managerial decisions on resource acquisition and deployment influence capability embeddedness and argue that capability embeddedness has an incremental effect on firm performance beyond the effects from organizational resources and capabilities. To investigate these issues, we present a hierarchical composed error structure framework that relies on cross-sectional data (and allows for generalizations to panel data). We demonstrate the framework in the context of retailing, where we show that the embeddedness of organizational capabilities influences retailer performance above and beyond the tangible and intangible resources and capabilities that a retailer possesses. Our results illustrate that understanding how resources and capabilities influence performance at different hierarchical levels within a firm can aid managers to make better decisions on how they can embed certain capabilities within the structural and social relationships within the firm. Moreover, understanding whether the underlying objectives of the capabilities that are being built and cultivated have convergent or divergent goals is critical, as it can influence the extent to which the embedded capabilities enhance firm performance. © 2007, Decision Sciences Institute.","And stochastic frontier models; Composed error models; Embeddedness; Organizational capabilities; Resource-based theory; Retail management",

The purpose of this study is to examine whether loyalty behavior and loyalty motives for a range of service industries varies with three demographic characteristics (age, sex and occupation). Design/methodology/approach - The overriding research propositions were tested by administering over 700 questionnaires across three medium-high contact service industries (dental, hairdressing and travel agents). Findings - Results indicate that age and occupation are associated with service loyalty (repurchase intention and loyalty behavior) across the three industries studied, while gender is not. What is especially evident from the data is that more mature age groups (35-54 and over 55 years) display significantly more loyal behaviour than their younger counterparts (18-24, and 25-34 years). Additionally, it was found that older clients possess different motives (social benefits, special treatment and confidence) for staying loyal compared to the younger clients. Originality/value - The results can be explained by the fact that people (consumers) reach a point in their life where their social networks shrink (children leave home, retirement from work, etc.). In many cases this relationship void is not easily filled. The concept of social support explains why older consumers satisfy their social needs by engaging in social conversation with service providers. By staying with a particular service provider (hairdresser, doctor, dentist, fitness center, dry cleaner, etc.) they become recognised and feel a sense of familiarity. It facilitates social engagement with service providers, and older consumers derive considerable psychological value from these social exchanges. The implications for firms' market segmentation strategy and future research implications are discussed.","Customer loyalty; Customer retention; Demographics; Gender; Service industries",

Design/methodology/approach - Materialism level and perceived status associated with status brands are measured amongst Bangkok people. The correlation between the two shows the nature and the extent of the impact of the strategy on materialism. Findings - Status brand strategy promotes materialism at a moderate level. Older and low to middle income people are susceptible to the impact of the strategy. The three characteristics of the brand - symbolic meaning, quality, and emotional appeal - show a strong impact on materialists. Research limitations/implications - This paper focuses on the Bangkok population and a single status brand. The analysis does not distinguish between the perception of the owner and non-owner of the brand. Practical implications - The findings point to adopting appropriate marketing strategies. These are: use direct marketing channels, expand product range to introduce affordable products, and communicate against bad connotation of materialism. Originality/value - This paper calls for a reexamining of the impact of status brand strategy in escalating materialism. The findings will help in implementing strategies to discourage excessive materialism. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brands; Business ethics; Consumer behaviour; Corporate social responsibility; Thailand",

The purpose of this paper is to describe a managerial framework of EPE based upon these parameters. Design/methodology/approach - Case illustrations are used to underpin the introduced managerial framework of EPE. Findings - The EPE of business practices is not only dependent upon the ethical values and principles of today, but those principles of tomorrow may be equally, or even more, crucial. The EPE of business practices is also dependent upon the surrounding context and its specific ethical values and principles. Furthermore, it is dependent upon the gap between different perceptions of ethical values and principles and if the outcome of the corporation's ethical values and principles are proactive or reactive in relation to the reigning ethical values and principles in the marketplace and society. Finally, it is also dependent upon the potential and eventual consequences of ethical values and principles. Research limitations/implications - The only way that we can ""objectively"" evaluate past ethical values and principles is through the use of ethical values and principles at the time and in respect to the context at hand. Research tends to fail when considering the longitudinal and evolutionary dimensions in the exploration of ethical values and principles in business practices. There is too much focus upon on-the-spot-accounts in the past and in current research efforts. An important area for further research is how to deal with the durability and variability of ethical values and principles in business practices in the marketplace and society. The key may be a stronger emphasis on longitudinal research efforts that may explore them over time and as contexts evolve. Ethical values and principles are connected and re-connected over time and across contexts in one way or another. They have a past, a current status and a future. Practical implications - The decision as to whether business practices are ethical or unethical is - relatively speaking - easy to determine from a narrow perspective, however, the decision whether business practices are ethical or unethical becomes complicated as the perspective is widened and deepened. An introduced managerial framework of EPE provides a generic foundation and structure to examine the acceptability versus unacceptability of business practices. Originality/value - The paper introduces a managerial framework of EPE, followed by case illustrations. It addresses the impact of time on ethical values and principles in any context on the potential and eventual gaps, outcomes and consequences in business practices.

Stakeholder engagement is traditionally seen as corporate responsibility in action. Indeed, in some literatures there exists an assumption that the more an organisation engages with its stakeholders, the more it is responsible. This simple more is better' view of stakeholder engagement belies the true complexity of the relationship between engagement and corporate responsibility. Stakeholder engagement may be understood in a variety of different ways and from a variety of different theoretical perspectives. Stakeholder engagement may or may not involve a moral dimension and, hence, is primarily a morally neutral practice. It is therefore argued that stakeholder engagement must be seen as separate from, but related to, corporate responsibility. A model that reflects the multifaceted relationship between the two constructs is proposed. This model not only allows the coincidence of stakeholder engagement with corporate responsibility, but also allows for the development of the notion of corporate irresponsibility. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate irresponsibility; Corporate responsibility; Human resource management; Social reporting; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder theory",

I show, first, that responsible leadership in a global stakeholder society is a relational and inherently moral phenomenon that cannot be captured in traditional dyadic leader-follower relationships (e.g., to subordinates) or by simply focusing on questions of leadership effectiveness. Business leaders have to deal with moral complexity resulting from a multitude of stakeholder claims and have to build enduring and mutually beneficial relationships with all relevant stakeholders. I contend, second, that in doing so leaders bundle the energy of different constituencies and enable social capital building. Social capital can be understood as actual or potential resources inherent to more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual recognition (Bourdieu 1980). By drawing on network analysis I suggest, third, that responsible leaders weave durable relational structures and ultimately networks of relationships which are rich in ties to otherwise unconnected individuals or groups. Against this background I argue, fourth, that responsible leadership may result in the creation of value networks (Lord and Brown, 2001) of multiple stakeholders, which enhance social capital and thereby contribute to both a sustainable business and the common good. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Leadership ethics; Responsible leadership; Social capital; Stakeholder relationships",

However, those who apply Kant in this way often hold businesses themselves morally accountable, and this conception of collective responsibility contradicts the kind of moral agency that underlies Kant's ethics. A business has neither inclinations nor the capacity to reason, so it lacks the conditions necessary for constraint by the moral law. Instead, corporate policies ought to be understood as analogous to legal constraints. They may encourage or discourage certain actions, but they cannot determine a person's maxim - which for Kant is the focus of moral judgment. Because there is no collective intention apart from any intentions of the individual agents who act as members of the corporation, an organization itself has no moral obligations. This poses a dilemma: either apply the categorical imperative to the actions of particular businesspeople and surrender the notion of collective responsibility, or apply a different moral theory to the actions of businesses themselves. Given the diffusion of responsibility in a bureaucracy, the explanatory usefulness of collective responsibility may force business ethicists to abandon Kant's moral philosophy. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bowie; Categorical imperative; Collective responsibility; Corporate internal decision procedure (CID); Corporate responsibility; Decision procedures; Deontological ethics; Kant; Maxims; Moral agency; Norman; Responsibility",

One of the most relevant conclusions from this brief review is that the process utilized in making strategic decisions is vitally important for decision effectiveness. Firms that develop a decision-making process based on reliable, diverse knowledge are more likely to make high-quality strategic decisions. Combining this decision-making process with a pro-stakeholder culture can improve opportunity recognition in areas related to stakeholders' ethical concerns. In turn, firms focused on business ethics can enhance their performance. We also believe that knowledge in this area could be enhanced, via future research, by developing answers to the following questions:•What is the relationship between the variety of ethical demands faced by firms and firms' propensity to make high-quality strategic decisions?•What effect does developing explicit decision-making guidelines for complying with business ethics demands have on strategic risk taking?•What role do the characteristics of strategic leaders play in the reconciliation of ethical demands versus economic demands facing the firm?•Do certain industry groups or partnerships encourage/discourage the development of ethical decision-making capabilities? Executives are faced with resource limitations, complicated industry environments, intense competition, and dynamic customer demands. Within this context, the effectiveness of executives' decision making is of paramount importance (Elbanna & Child, 2007; Miller & Cardinal, 1994). Through the analysis presented herein, we have attempted to offer some insight regarding the relationship between business ethics and firm performance. Executives are encouraged to embrace a pro-stakeholder culture within their firms. Doing so is likely to enable them to at least minimally satisfy influential stakeholders. More importantly, it can lead to a more thorough understanding of stakeholders' ethical concerns. In turn, this understanding can provide valuable insight as to the potential economic opportunities that can be derived from stakeholders' ethical concerns. Other questions to be answered by each firm include:•How broadly should executives define organizational ""stakeholders""?•What criteria should firms use when prioritizing inputs from various stakeholders?•Should ethical and social concerns be incorporated in all strategic decisions?•Would it be helpful to have, on the TMT, a social concerns advocate who participates in the strategic decision-making process? © 2007.",,

This article examines multi-stakeholder standards compared to other collaborative standards adopted in the past decade, and focuses subsequently on the peculiarities of multi-stakeholder standards regarding participation, governance and implementation. Multi-stakeholder standards, which involve business and NGOs, and sometimes also governments, are more specific and well-elaborated than other types of standards. But monitoring and implementation are rarely used as means for increasing participation from multiple stakeholders, including most notably those from developing countries.

Existing research indicates that this type of governance codes has a limited direct effect on ethical or whistleblowing behaviour whereas whistleblowing policies at the corporate level seem to be more effective. Therefore, evidence on the impact of (inter)national corporate governance codes on the content of corporate whistleblowing policies is important to understand their indirect impact on whistleblowing behaviour. This study analyzes the contents of whistleblowing policies, and parts of corporate codes of conduct and codes of ethics, describing such policies of 56 leading European companies. By classifying the contents in seven categories, an exploratory framework was created. General contents often identified were: applicability to all employees, a group-wide scope and an authoritative tone. The most common general violations to report were breaches of internal policies and external regulations or laws. The more specific violations most frequently mentioned were criminal offences and dangers to health and safety or the environment. Contacts to report to were the direct or indirect supervisors, a compliance officer or a confidential ""hotline"" facility. A confidentiality guarantee was common and anonymous reporting was often possible, though sometimes discouraged. Protection against retaliation is stated by ensuring that retaliation will not happen, prohibiting it or making it punishable. The requirement of good faith was frequently given. Finally, investigation of the report was often guaranteed. Surprisingly little information is given on the treatment of whistleblowers reporting an unfounded complaint in good faith, or reporting a violation they were involved in. The study's findings are most relevant to companies without a whistleblowing policy or those that intend to benchmark their policies, and to pan-European standard setters. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Codes of conduct; Codes of ethics; Compliance; Content; Whistleblowing",

This has not affected the arms industry, however. For, this industry has not been discussed in CSR literature, perhaps because few CSR scholars have questioned this industry's privileged status as an instrument of national sovereignty. But major changes in the organization of political communities call traditional views of sovereignty into question. With these considerations in mind I assess the U.S. arms industry on the basis of CSR requirements regarding the environment, social equity, profitability, and use of political power. I find that this industry fails to meet any of these four CSR requirements. Countering a claim that these failings should not be held against arms manufacturers because their products are crucial to national defense, I contend that many of these companies function not as dutiful agents of a nation-state but as politically powerful entities in their own right. So, I conclude, they should be held responsible for the foreseeable consequences that flow from use of their products. This responsibility should include civil liability and, in cases involving war crimes and violations of human rights, responsibility under international human rights standards. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Arms industry; Corporate social responsibility; Human rights; Liability",

Donaldson applied the social contract tradition of Locke and Rawls to the ethics of management decision-making, and with Dunfee, has advanced this project ever since. Current events suggest that if the field is to remain relevant it needs to return to examining social and economic fairness, and? Rawl's approach to social contracting suggests a way to start. First, however, the field needs to discard the weaker and counterproductive aspects of its Lockean legacy: Locke's hostility to government activism and his indifference with regard to outcomes for the bulk of society. Donaldson's and Dunfee's social contracting approach is not suited to, nor was it designed to, analyze or resolve broad issues of social and economic justice. Their postulated network of communities upon which they rely is problematic in a number of ways, and while they take the legal and political status quo into account, their method does not deal with the historical reality that, as the economic and social environment changes, promoting greater justice requires new and sometimes coercive government interventions. Rawls's work, however, does acknowledge the historically demonstrable necessity of using the power of government to help to achieve desirable social outcomes. While he rejected Mill's methodology, Rawls was inspired by the earlier philosopher's concerns for social justice at a time of major economic change.

Two theories from Lifespan Development Psychology - selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC) and socioemotional selectivity - are increasingly used in interdisciplinary research on older adults and are likely to contribute to the study of leisure behavior. Selection, optimization, and compensation theory describes how older adults set and pursue goals. Socioemotional selectivity theory describes continuity and change in social relationships. Both theories are empirically robust but have only been applied to leisure research in a few instances. Despite limited attention by leisure researchers, these theories provide a unique perspective on later life that may enhance the explanation and prediction of older adults' leisure pursuits and related relationships. If SOC or socioemotional selectivity theories are used to guide leisure research, the mechanisms that older adults use to adapt to changes in later life and their sources of social support must be addressed. The following article describes SOC and socioemotional selectivity theories, their relevance to leisure research, and provides guidance for using them in research on leisure behavior.

Amongst the many drivers are cost reduction, core business focus, flexibility and risk transfer. However, it is easy to be over-enthusiastic about the benefits without fully appreciating the risks and their consequences. To avoid the downsides and maximize the upsides, an organisation should take a considered risk management approach which embraces Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is defined and placed in its contemporary business context, highlighting the importance for the development of the added-value dimensions, whether economic or societal.

So far, little attention has been given to the fact that business networks in particular markets may be dissimilar because of differences among institutions. The paper advances a model where institutions are assumed to influence five major characteristics of business; (1) the processual aspects of the network, (2) the structural aspects of the network, (3) the function of firms and relationships in the network, (4) the meaning of strategy and planning, and (5) social relationships in the context of inter-firm relationships. The analysis builds on three types of substances of institutions - cognitive, normative, and regulative, which in turn are specified according to different aspects. The cognitive substance of business networks is explored through the aspects of self, time, and causality. The normative substance is explored through the aspects of achieved versus ascribed status, inner versus outer direction, universalism versus particularism, and trust. The regulative substance is specified as an authority system and a sanction system. The analysis demonstrates that, as institutions differ in these three markets, the business among them also differs in terms of the five characteristics, and this variation calls for different strategies for firms operating in these markets. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/ approach - The research was conducted on three groups of stakeholders from a collection agency (a typical outsourcing firm) over a period of two years. A questionnaire was developed based on the work by public relations researchers on measuring relationship outcomes. Analysis consisted of descriptive statistics with means and standard deviations. A correlation analysis was performed to investigate the possible effects of a number of the questions on reputation. Findings - The findings from the study showed correlations between a number of the statements measuring the relationship outcomes and the firm's perception among its stakeholders. The most important finding in this study was the significant correlation between the firm's treatment of its clients' customers and the impact on the clients' reputation.

The model also aims to address benefits beyond the functional in business-to business (B2B) settings by including psychological and social benefits. Design/methodology/ approach - The study is based on a survey of 275 B2B buyers in Australian manufacturing firms. Findings - The findings reveal that functional benefits enhance firm-level commitment to the relationship, whereas psychological and social benefits affect individual commitment to the relationship directly and firm-level commitment indirectly, thereby emphasizing the importance of considering the individual as distinct from the firm. Given that the relationship is a process over time, and in recognition of the non-static nature of relationship benefits, the paper also explores the changes in benefits over relationship stages, including their impact on commitment. In contrast to expectations results show that while all three types of benefits increase, there is no change in the impact of all three benefit types on commitment across relationship stages. Practical implications - The study recognizes that the individual in the firm also benefits from B2B relationships and offers a measure of both firm and individual relationship benefits for use in future studies. The measure may also be used as a point of discussion about relationship management. Originality/value - The study is framed within social exchange theory and, is the first to simultaneously examine three types of relationship benefits and their interaction with both the individual and firm viewpoint.

Marketing literature recognizes that stakeholders play a significant role in influencing organizations and markets, but has not targeted a single integrated approach to examine the relationship between stakeholder management and GMS. Design/methodology/approach: This research comprised several phases, including the development of a typology of GMS, an analysis of how managers prioritize stakeholders, a study of the influence of stakeholders on GMS, and an analysis of the influence of the organizational context on managers' perception of the stakeholders. The hypotheses were validated using multivariate correlational techniques. Findings: The study identified the stakeholders associated with GMS and their impact on the strategy adopted by the firms, and established how this is moderated by the firm's own economic sector and organizational characteristics. Research limitations/implications: Future studies might replicate and extend the research in other industries and countries to ascertain whether environmental concerns have different effects in other contexts. Practical implications: The surveys on GMS and stakeholder perception undertaken in the present survey are a potential source of information for managers - because they can be used as a self-diagnostic tool to determine if a firm's attitude to the environment is reactive or proactive.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper the association of ties with the sharing of different types of knowledge was measured by a specifically created and developed web survey that was made available to 22 units in the subject organization. Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MRQAP) was used to examine the resulting data in order to address the following questions: first, is there a significant association between strength of business ties and the sharing of public knowledge? Second, is there a significant association between strength of social ties and the sharing of private knowledge? Findings - Findings in this paper show that the strength of business relationships rather than the strength of social relationships contributed most significantly to the sharing of public and private knowledge in this organization. Specifically, the frequency of business interactions predicted the sharing of public non-codified knowledge, while the closeness of business relationships predicted the sharing of private non-codified knowledge and the sharing of public codified knowledge. Unexpectedly, neither business nor social ties predicted the sharing of private codified knowledge. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows that one organization belonging to a certain type of business was studied, and these results might be more relevant in the setting of similar business organizations that have similarities in their contexts and profiles with this organization. Practical implications - The results in this paper may assist organizations in rethinking the ways of approaching certain types of knowledge sharing in their strategic and infrastructural decisions and their application.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a detailed examination of the dynamics of 116 strategy changes, which are influenced by a firm's relationships in 20 New Zealand and Swedish internationalising SMEs. It uses the qualitative research method to develop theory. A conceptual model with eight categories relating to relationships and strategic change during the internationalisation process of the firm is developed. Findings: Using the conceptual model as a framework to analyse the data, it was found that existing relationships play an important role in 59 market strategy changes and 57 mode strategy changes. The main findings are that business relationships are more influential in internationalisation strategy changes than social relationships, especially with regard to mode changes in foreign markets. Most mode changes are reactive. Market strategy changes, however, are evenly balanced between proactive and reactive changes. Overall, more changes can be attributed to direct relationship influences than indirect third party influences. The findings from this study are used to develop seven propositions.

Since platforms have a desirable potential to reduce development and production costs, there is an extensive bulk of knowledge describing underlying platform principles and challenges. But the vast majority of the identified challenges are based on single firms and brand contexts, which imply that previous findings might not be applicable when platform development involves several brands, here called multibranded platforms. In the present article it is therefore suggested that there is lack of knowledge describing managerial challenges of multibranded platform development. To be able to capture such a strategy that holds certain complexity and unknown dimension, an explorative and longitudinal field study is supposed to achieve the finest insights into a yet incompletely documented phenomenon. Because of the field-study approach, findings from the study are theoretically validated in relation to existing knowledge from other contributions. To start developing a multibranded product platform development framework, the present study identifies three distinctively different strategic forces that must be handled in such multibranded platform development: (1) the creation of a common architecture; (2) accomplishing product differentiation within an expanded and multibranded product scope; and (3) corporate responsibility in the transition from single-branded to multibranded platform development. Three dimensions of managerial challenges are identified. The first is technology management challenges, which deal with commonalization in terms of the development of common multibranded architectures. The major challenge to achieve architectural commonalization is that no individuals from any brand have the proper multibranded architectural knowledge. Instead, multibranded architectures must evolve from the beginning and be founded on a new and expanded brand scope. Architectural commonalization also includes elements of unlearning since previous experiences have little relevance. The second challenge is brand management challenges and deals with brand differentiation in terms of portfolio management. Differentiation is an effect of increased diversification that particularly challenges brands of opposite generic competitive strategies. The third challenge dimension is called corporate management challenges and deals with the combination of the two others. From a corporate management perspective, it seems important to provide new organizational structures that support and combine interests of technology and brand management. Finally, multibranded platform development is a corporate strategy that affects business units and functional units thoroughly. © 2007 Product Development & Management Association.",,"Multibranded architectures; Multibranded platform development; Multimanagerial challenges; Technology management; Competitive intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Knowledge acquisition; Management science; Strategic planning; Product development"

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the deceit, via a content analysis of official investigative reports and other published documents, to determine the extent to which the Bank's culture and leadership may have influenced the rogue traders' behaviour. The findings suggest that cultural issues, and the role played by the Bank's leaders, were influential in creating a profit-driven culture that ultimately impacted the Bank's foreign exchange operating activities. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Australia; Banks; Board of directors; Business ethics; Risk management",

In this article, we outline a model of factors influencing the transfer of HR practices to MNC units abroad. The article has two main contributions. First, we develop a more holistic understanding of the outcome of HR practice transfer as encompassing three dimensions: implementation, internalisation and integration. Second, we expand current explanations of transfers of practices to foreign units. We argue that transfer of HR practices is a social process where the governance mechanisms used by the MNC, characteristics of the subsidiary HR systems, the social relationship between the subsidiary and MNC headquarters, and the transfer approach taken by headquarters management will influence the outcome of the process. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,

Sustainability Reporting should also give consumers the information they need to purchase the most sustainable products available (Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, 2004). This article analyses the driving factors influencing CSR and Sustainability Reporting at seven breweries in the Netherlands. It also gives a better understanding of organizational behaviour with reference to CSR and the reasons breweries have for Sustainability Reporting. The Dutch government has no intention of forcing organizations to publish a sustainability report, since it is trying to diminish the volume of legislation. Rather, the government prefers to rely on the willingness and initiatives of organizations to make CSR a success. In 2006, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs will evaluate the effect of its CSR policy. But is it a success already? During our research, breweries appeared to find CSR more important than Sustainability Reporting. Sustainability reporting is, for most breweries, not the way to reach stakeholders. Most stakeholders have their own means for receiving information e.g. annual reports, meetings, public statements and press releases. Although small breweries think CSR is very important, they feel no pressure from outside to publish a sustainability report. For them it is very complex and expensive to publish a sustainability report. Large breweries feel pressure from many stakeholders to be transparent, but not on a regular basis. We conclude from this research that CSR does not stimulate Sustainability Reporting, but neither does Sustainability Reporting stimulate CSR. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Breweries; Corporate community involvement; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental report; Narratives; Social report; Stakeholders; Sustainability report",

Design/methodology/approach - The author examines a range of current theories that address the question of ""why corporate morality pays"", most notably instrumental stakeholder theory. The focus is not on theoretical validity but the institutional assumptions that underpin the theory. It then compares these assumptions with the reality in emerging economies to challenge the universality of the theory. Findings - Existing interpretations of stakeholder theory and corporate social responsibility (CSR) are heavily influenced by the west and developed countries. Only when firm-stakeholder interactions are overwhelmingly rule-governed will developing a trustworthy and cooperative relationship with stakeholders result in competitiveness.

Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical propositions on how the various dimensions of national culture influence corporate social responsibility are developed and empirically tested. Findings - The authors propose that companies based in countries characterized by higher levels of power distance, individualism, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance exhibit lower levels of social and environmental performance. Empirical tests of these propositions are performed via pooled ordinary least squares regression models using a novel proprietary dataset on 463 firms from 23 North American, European and Asian countries. Power distance and masculinity are found to have a significant negative effect on corporate social and environmental performance, whereas cultural differences with respect to individualism and uncertainty avoidance have no significant effect. Originality/value - The potential contribution of this work lies in offering empirical evidence to test the widely held assumption that corporations' socially responsible behavior is influenced by the cultural context in their home country. The adoption and the external appreciation of this kind of behavior does appear to be contingent on specific dimensions of national culture, but not on others. Thus, positive social change through voluntary corporate action may be optimized via initiatives that build on specific cultural values in the relevant country. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Corporate social responsibility; National cultures",

We examine the responses of firms to activist shareholder resolutions with a particular focus on when firms choose to engage in dialogue with stakeholder groups. Based on resolutions filed by members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility from 2002 to 2005, we find that corporate managers are more likely to engage in dialogue with shareholder activists when the issue of concern involves social justice, when the firm's size is smaller, when there are more outside directors of the corporation's board, and when corporate visibility is high.

In this thought-provoking book, The Morality of Business: A Profession for Human Wealthcare, Machan argues that business, like medicine, enhances human life, and that it is indeed a thoroughly decent profession for people to choose to enter, in order to best serve the worthy goal of promoting all around prosperity. He goes beyond the utilitarian case, that business serves society quite well, to contend that caring for one's own economic well being is prudent, that enhancing the wealth of one's household is a proper objective, and to serve clients in the capacity of managing their wealth successfully is every bit as honorable as serving patients with their health needs. The result is a positive statement, in the tradition of Adam Smith and David Hume, addressing some of the most controversial topics of today, including job ""security,"" outsourcing, and government regulation. ""Machan's The Morality of Business is a valuable resource for both participants and observers of the business world. In an engaging and entertaining style Machan explains how the capitalist orientation is fundamentally ethical. Furthermore, he dissects the chief arguments used by free market adversaries and shows how they are flawed. His book will bolster capitalism's advocates and will encourage its critics to see it in a fresh light."" - Barry A. Liebling, author of Think and Act on Business Ethics: A Radical Capitalist View ""This primer has an admirable aim: providing a moral defense of business, capitalism and free markets.

In order to accommodate a closer fit the paper argues for a dynamic reinterpretation of CSR. Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual paper that presents discussions and conclusions at the theoretical level. It provides a brief overview of core parts of the CSR and the innovation literature and then analyses how the perspectives on the firm in these two literatures fit together. The final section raises normative and theoretical issues with respect to innovation and CSR. Findings - The paper documents the difficulties of assuming that innovation policy and CR policy can easily be mutually supportive. While the assumption of compatibility and synergy may be reasonable for some types of innovation, and some types of CR, it can hardly be argued on a general basis. A core finding is the need to differentiate between complementary static and dynamic views. While much of the innovation literature is dynamic in its nature, much of the CR literature has traditionally been given a static interpretation. Originality/value - The original value of the paper is that it highlights inconsistencies in the dominant static interpretation of CSR with important sides of the innovation economy.

Representatives of the corporation engage community stakeholders to identify opportunities in the schools where Johnson & Johnson support and volunteerism can help make a difference in the lives of young people. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports on an existing school to career program that was developed in the USA but has recently been adapted to meet the needs of Ireland's education community. Findings - Past research has shown the importance of linking academic studies with real world applications to improve educational outcomes for pre-college students. The BTE program has been shown to have positive benefits for students, schools, communities and Johnson & Johnson employees. In addition, BTE may provide a possible solution to the declining number of students pursuing health care careers. Originality/value - This paper looks at a unique US-based business/education intervention from the perspective of stakeholder engagement.

This is subsequently linked to the climate strategies and related capabilities of companies, reckoning with societal and competitive contexts. Findings - What a corporate climate strategy looks like depends on the type of stakeholders that a company manages more proactively, which is in turn determined by the extent to which these stakeholders control critical resources.

The results of the workshops on the cases are then taken to show how to build on the earlier conceptual framework. Findings - Much of the difficulty of trading off corporate responsibility with financial performance is due to a lack of detailed understanding of how corporate responsibility issues can affect drivers of value. The framework was validated but to be effective it requires detailed understanding of both corporate responsibility and financial management. Research limitations/implications - The cases were undertaken within one company and so the results need to be tested in other contexts.

This has led to the emergence of two different approaches to operationalising TNC responsibilities for workers' rights in developing countries: codes of conduct and global agreements. Despite the importance of this development, few studies have systematically compared the effects of these two different ways of dealing with workers' rights. This article addresses this gap by analysing how codes of conduct and global agreements both independently and interactively affect workers' rights. We do this based on a qualitative study of the Sri Lankan operations of a Swedish TNC in Sri Lanka, and on interviews with union and NGO representatives actively involved in codes of conduct and global agreements. Our results indicate that global agreements independently address all the aspects included in codes of conduct, while also addressing additional, more process-oriented aspects of workers' rights. Hence, on their own, global agreements seem to comprise the superior approach to promoting workers' rights. Furthermore, our results indicate that promoting codes of conduct has negative interactive effects on global agreements. Based on these results, we argue that the current focus on codes of conduct is counterproductive for the promotion of workers' rights. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Code of conduct; Corporate responsibility; Global agreement; International framework agreement; Labour practice; Non-governmental organisation; Transnational corporation; Union; Workplace democracy",

A comparative literature analysis of shareholder and stakeholder theory shows that the scope of corporate governance has broadened over time, a phenomenon influenced by the growing importance of CSR. While there is now a coherent stream of theoretical approaches within corporate governance that are concerned with the broader environment, there is little empirical evidence to shed light on these. Using qualitative field research, the paper aims to redress this balance. The research sample is narrowed to those connected to FTSE 100 companies in the UK. Data analysis revealed a significant alignment between the corporate governance and CSR programmes within the sample companies. Key influencers for this convergence were seen to be regulatory pressure, the rise of business ethics (due to corporate scandals) and demands from SRI investors. As such, there is evidence that businesses are starting to look beyond financial accountability as the sole route to creating shareholder value. This development is causing a shift of the corporate-governance concept to a stakeholder-based approach, with a balance of focus between the short-term financial accountability of directors with a long-term sustainable strategy. This increased alignment between corporate governance and CSR is reflected in the development of more formal governance structures, such as the growing number of CSR board committees, SEE risk registers and CSR reports.",,

Our findings show that individuals higher in cognitive moral development, lower in Machiavellianism, with a more internal locus of control, a less relativistic moral philosophy, and higher job satisfaction are less likely to plan and enact such choices. When issues involve high moral intensity such choices are also suppressed. Where organizations have benevolent climates, strong ethical cultures, and (enforced) codes of conduct, fewer unethical choices occur. Intriguingly, most of these influences are stronger for behavior than intention, suggesting a non-conscious or intuitive path for (un)ethical decisions that has seen much less investigation in the behavioral ethics literature.

These practices and meanings are, in turn, shaped by the interactions and preferences of a variety of diverse groups involved in what is routinely seen within the mainstream literature as a singularly specific sexuality and cultural project. Thus, we attend to two areas-the influence of the various social engagements associated with Gaydar together with the further extension of its trajectory 'beyond the web'. Through the case of Gaydar, we contribute a study that recognises the need for attention to sexuality in information systems research and one which illustrates sexuality as a pivotal aspect of culture.

In attending to issues and debates concerning everyday consumption practices within the domestic sphere, the following discussion suggests an approach that firmly places an understanding on how 'goods' and 'things' are used, lived with and appropriated into everyday life. Drawing on in-depth interviews carried out in the homes of 50 respondents in Greater Manchester, UK, the article develops and complements existing ideas and research in cultural anthropology, consumer studies and, more recently, sociology of consumption, which focus on understanding aspects of the complex relationships that exist between subjects and objects, and how these operate within the boundaries of ordinary, mundane and routine consumption practices. It will be shown that one aspect of this relationship relates to the ways in which 'things' act as the embodiment of meaningful social relations and significant connections between family members, friends and even wider social networks, and offers one way of understanding material culture consumption within the home. This is explored via three observed processes of display, acquisition and appropriation within the home: gift objects as familial obligation; objects as markers of memory; and the commemorative potential of objects.

We argue that existing theoretical perspectives of business groups pay attention to four critical external contexts, each of which draws from a specific theoretical perspective: market conditions (transaction cost theory), social relationships (relational perspective), political factors (political economy perspective), and external monitoring mechanisms (agency theory). Business groups adapt to these external forces by deploying various internal mechanisms along two key dimensions: one focuses on the distinctive roles of the group affiliates (horizontal connectedness) and the other focuses on coupling and order between the parent firm and its affiliates (vertical linkages). Based on these two dimensions, a typology of business group forms is developed: network (N-form), club (C-form), holding (H-form), and multidivisional (M-form). Utilizing this model we provide research questions which facilitate an improved future research agenda. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.",,

It is, in effect, ironic in how it balances change with tradition. It makes the new regulation pliable and difficult to see as a step to a state-led approach.There is a resistant trend to unions generally even if recognition cases may vary in terms of employer orientations.This article focuses on such issues by addressing a broader understanding of regulation through an ethnographic case study analysis.

Specifically, the study directly replicates the impact of social capital derived from the micro-managerial networking relationships and ties with top managers at other firms and government officials on macro-organizational performance using data from Ghana. This study further extends previous work by examining the impact of social capital derived from managerial social networking relationships and ties with community leaders on organizational performance. It examines how the relationship between social capital and organizational performance is contingent on an organization's competitive strategic orientation. The findings suggest that social capital developed from managerial networking and social relationships with top managers at other firms, government officials (political leaders and bureaucratic officials), and community leadership enhance organizational performance. The findings from the contingency analyses reveal some interesting trends. The impact of social capital on organizational performance differs between firms that pursue the different competitive strategies (low-cost, differentiation, and combination of low-cost and differentiation) and those who do not pursue those strategies.

Is that not a strange paradox? We do not think so. If there is a paradox, it is more due to the fact that a distinction is made between overindebtedness and financial exclusion, although this is only one of the aspects of the problem. While overindebtedness is generally considered a phenomenon separate from the rest of financial exclusion, this is mainly because of its visibility. The consequences of banking problems connected with a deposit account or non-cash means of payment are not as spectacular as those connected with credit can be. But the deprivation of all or part of financial services (from a bank account to loans and savings products) and overindebtedness are two sides of the same coin. These are components of the social phenomenon known as financial exclusion. Our hypothesis is that financial exclusion can be defined with regard to the social consequences of the banking problems of which it consists. From this viewpoint, overindebtedness is one of the consequences of banking problems which affect, in particular, but not only, people on low incomes. Likewise, difficulties in accessing various financial services lead to various social consequences which reinforce the process of social exclusion. However, on the one hand the banking difficulties that we are talking about are not limited only to difficulties of access but also include difficulties of use, and on the other hand, the consequences of these difficulties are broader than mere overindebtedness. The objective of this paper is to propose an analysis of financial exclusion for private individuals which structures these various types of problems and their consequences, and shows their similarities. To achieve this objective, we will firstly examine the main definitions of financial exclusion which have appeared over the last 15 years († 5.2). This analysis will enable us to highlight the aspects for understanding financial exclusion that are decisive but are frequently overlooked. This mainly concerns consideration of the difficulties in use along with difficulties in access, and the role of these difficulties in the development of the broader process of social exclusion. In fact financial exclusion is both cause and effect of social exclusion defined as ""all the mechanisms of breakdown, both in symbolic terms (stigma or negative attributes) and from the viewpoint of social relations (a break in the various social links which bind people together). Exclusion is both a process and a state which enshrines a lack of integration"". (Loisy, 2000, p. 42). Then in order to go beyond certain fragmented analyses which treat overindebtedness as being merely the result of increased precariousness and poverty or poorly considered individual choices, we analyse financialisation of social relationships within modern societies. The fact that it is possible to talk today about financial exclusion is due to the unavoidable nature of these services for people to live a normal social life. Thus in France, to receive a salary and social benefits, it is necessary to have a bank account. With regard to credit, matters are less clear: recourse to credit is often presented as a choice (sometimes ill-considered), as much as a constraint. However, as for a bank account or means of payment, borrowing is partly linked to the organisation of social relationships. So to contend with the ups and downs of life or to fulfil certain aspirations, borrowing increasingly appears an essential resource († 5.3). Finally, based on the preceding elements, we shall endeavour to show that the constraints placed on customers with modest incomes by financial institutions contribute directly to financial exclusion. These various constraints, which we shall describe in detail afterwards, make the implementation of high quality financial services a particularly delicate matter, as they need to reconcile adequate access for the customer and profitable transactions for the bank. The modes of response chosen to deal with the constraints explain both the difficulties of access and the difficulties in use and therefore overindebtedness, so there is no paradox in these different situations occurring concurrently († 5.4). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,

Prior studies that use various proxies of CSP reveal mixed results. This paper examines stakeholder relations as a solid measure of CSP, and its impact on firm performance. Building on Clarkson (1995), the study points out that stakeholder relationships are meaningful measures of social performance. Survey data have been sampled gathered from 101 Indonesian manufacturing firms. Models have been tested using structural equation modeling. Our data indicate that CSP strongly and significantly affects both a firm's competitive position and its financial performance. The relationship between CSP and financial performance is not mediated by firm strategy. It is, however, mediated by the firm's strategic position in market place. We conclude that stakeholder-oriented CSP adds to the firm's competitive advantage. Firms that apply CSP strategies are thus able to do their businesses more effectively. © Sofyan Rais, Robert V.

But, by taking a resource-based view (RBV), and by enhancing a firm's capability to engage in socially responsible activities, it can potentially create its own competitive advantages. We examine four major components of CSP - community relations, the environment, diversity, and employee relations. And we show that the ability of a firm to develop its knowledge and skills - as well as policies and implementation plans and procedures - in each of these areas is a potential resource that may in fact provide competitive advantages and higher organizational performance, bringing benefits to both society and the firm. The community dimension evaluates the firm's performance in relationship to philanthropic giving and community support. The environmental aspect considers such firm stewardship activities as pollution prevention, global warming, and recycling. The diversity component measures CSP considering such factors as board member diversity and a firm's hiring, evaluation, training, and promotion policies concerning women and minorities. The employee relations dimension examines such socially responsible human resource practices as innovative employee involvement programs and profit sharing. Together, these capabilities can provide tangible and intangible resources that can provide the firm with competitive advantages. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,

We also propose that the perspective on citizenship adopted by Néron and Norman is rather narrow, and therefore provide some alternative ways in which corporations and citizenship might be brought together.

She redefines the typical seven-step ethics management program from within - challenging the reader to reconsider what is possible within each aspect of this process. in doing so, she draws on the insights of Aristotle, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault and numerous contemporary organizational theorists and sociologists to create the space for the emergence of a morally responsive corporate ethos. © Mollie Painter-Morland 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,

The best decision, say virtue ethicists in the Aristotelian tradition, is often one that is made by a person of good character who knows the salient facts of the case and can frame the situation appropriately. In this respect ethical decisions and strategic decisions are similar. Rationality plays a role in good ethical decision-making, but virtue ethicists emphasize the importance of intuitions and emotions as well. Virtue ethics suggests a reconciliation of the factual and the normative. Virtues may explain as well as justify actions. The same is true of other psychological states and events. That psychological terms have normative implications does not render them useless in explanation. As Aristotle does not distinguish cleanly between the normative and empirical, so many moral philosophers today reject the is-ought dichotomy. They are prepared to learn from economists, psychologists, and other empirical scientists who offer information about the nature of the good life and of values. Social psychologists who study community or corporate culture suggest a close relationship between organizational and ethical features, much as Aristotle saw a close relationship between politics and ethics. We should infer from all this that in business ethics there is good reason for philosophers and organization scholars to work closely together. © 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

A case analysis is conducted of priority setting in a government health care context in Ontario, Canada, assessing how implementation of hospital accountability agreements meets the conditions of a leading international ethical framework for priority setting, ""accountability for reasonableness"" (A4R). Hospital accountability agreements provide a mechanism for government to ensure that public funding achieves desired performance in hospitals. A key goal of priority setting is fairness. A4R links priority setting, legitimacy, and fairness to theories of democratic deliberation, making a claim for fairness if the four conditions of relevance, publicity, revision/appeals, and enforcement are satisfied. Regarding the relevance condition, this analysis suggests that government only partially met the relevance condition providing limited stakeholder engagement but with evidence of policy learning and movement toward the establishment of inclusive stakeholder arrangements. Evidence suggests that government eventually progressed toward meeting the publicity condition. Government only partially met the revision/appeals condition and did not meet the enforcement condition, as the other conditions were only partially met. It is our view that regional governance structures in Ontario (i.e., Local Health Integration Networks or LHINs) provide an opportunity for the province to improve the fairness of their accountability agreement processes through enhancing transparency and stakeholder engagement.

It was 9 February 2005. Since early last year, Shiraishi Garments Co. (SGC) had begun outsourcing whole production to China to increase profit margins. As President, Takashi saw the immediate benefit of outsourcing to his bottom line. But he also saw moral issues with buying low-cost Chinese goods at the expense of worker health and safety. It concerned him for personal and business reasons. As a consumer goods company dealing in clothing and apparel, SGC needed to maintain a positive reputation: market success depended on its brand. Japanese companies had been wrestling with public trust for several years, ever since the Snow Brand milk poisoning episode in 2000, in which over 13,000 people became seriously ill. Usage of cheap overseas labour was reported widely as the reason Japanese companies were moving operations out of Japan and increasing domestic unemployment. Many Japanese companies outsourcing businesses overseas were taking steps to demonstrate concern for all employees and a strong commitment to corporate citizenship. SGC worked hard to improve labour conditions in its Chinese supply chain. For instance, when Takashi found local suppliers were reluctant to make the initial financial investments for first aid training in factories, SGC paid for the initial sessions. Soon thereafter, Chinese partners saw less time lost due to injuries and began to embrace first aid training. © Danny Samson and Prakash J. Singh 2008.",,

I suggest that there are actually many interpretations (or versions) of the separation thesis going around, ranging from semantic, empirical and reformative to some which are straightforwardly normative. While it is generally agreed that the separation thesis should be rejected, then, there is not as much agreement on what this thesis actually says. I suggest that whether or not we should reject the separation thesis, however, ultimately must depend on how we understand it more exactly - on certain interpretations, the thesis comes out as more or less trivially false, but we should demand more evidence or argument to reject it on certain other interpretations.

Research Findings/Insights: The new SEC regulations require mutual fund compliance officers to report directly to the board of directors. The board is also now responsible for hiring/firing, and for approving the compliance officer's compensation. After a literature review and a survey of compliance officers and mutual fund board members, we conclude that SEC Rule 38a-1 represents a positive step toward increasing compliance officer independence in the mutual fund industry in the United States. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The direct reporting relationship established by Rule 38a-1 between mutual fund compliance officers and boards of directors sets the industry apart from corporate America, in general, where compliance/ethics officers typically report to management. We assert that the increased board involvement in ethics and compliance-related matters that results from the new SEC regulations allows mutual fund boards to govern more effectively. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We contend that the SEC and other international regulators could improve independence and corporate governance even further if they required mutual fund compliance officers to be totally independent of management, by not allowing them to be employees of investment adviser companies. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Business ethics; Mutual fund ownership",

The paper combines an analysis of Foucault's work on discipline and control, with an examination of his later work on the ethical subject and technologies of the self. Our paper argues that the work of the later Foucault provides an important contribution to business ethics theory, practice and pedagogy. We discuss how it offers an alternative avenue to traditional normative ethical theory that both converges and diverges with other extant alternatives. By situating ethics as practices of the self, and by demonstrating the conditions under which freedom in organizations can be exercised, Foucault's ethics attempt to connect an understanding and critique of power with a personal project of self. He therefore provides a theory of subjectivity that potentially informs a reshaping of contemporary virtue ethics theory, value-based management, and business ethics teaching. © 2008.

E.g., ""citizenship"" typically implies membership in a state and an identity akin to national identity; but this connotation of citizenship is obviously problematic for multinational corporations.

At a minimum, managers are required to protect shareholder's interests when other stakeholders are unaffected by their decision. This ethical imperative has been established in the literature. In cases of conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders, the board of directors of the firm has an ethical obligation to shareholders. The structure of the board can affect its ability to fulfill this obligation. Two specific cases where managerial actions have been argued to be unethical are the adoption of classified boards and poison pills. In this study, we empirically analyze the role of board structure in protecting shareholder rights in the specific case of antitakeover provisions. We test this question on a sample of firms whose shareholders have voted to remove antitakeover provisions and find that independent, focused boards are more likely to accede to shareholder resolutions than are less independent boards. Board size is also important and related to other board structures. We draw implications of this finding for future research on the ethics of board governance. © 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

There are two fundamental issues associated with this. Firstly, would the introduction of rules have any distributional effect? Secondly, what would be the efficiency cost? In this paper, we explore both questions with reference to a job-security corporate rule. We show that the job-security rule will always produce distributional consequences which are consistent with its objectives. However, whether or not it is a socially desirable policy depends on whether the economy is at an efficient allocation and what motivated the policy. It can be shown that under some conditions, even if the initial allocation is efficient, yet not the socially desirable one, a corporate rule - like the job security one - may produce socially desirable gains. The same can be said in the case where the initial allocation is inefficient even in the presence of competitive markets (due to incompleteness problems). However, these social gains would come at the expense of competitiveness. In an internationally open environment this may offset the initial social gains from this policy. Whether or not this happens would then depend on whether agents have a social dimension to their preferences or not. If they do, their response to the initiative may offset the initial loss of competitiveness.

Findings: Early CSR research was a product of the cataclysmic events that the scholars in this field experienced personally and professionally, most importantly the labor conflicts of the 1930s and the uneasy labor peace that subsequently followed. By contrast, the more modern approach that emphasizes the ethics of executive decision making became the dominant paradigm in the 1980s when institutional support for a macro perspective disappeared. Practical implications: The first generation of scholars were concerned with issues of economic fairness and the independence of governments from interest group pressures. With these issues currently reasserting themselves on a global level, modern scholars could learn a great deal from studying the insights and practical experience of these neglected thinkers. Originality/value: This is both the first in-depth study of the content and origins of early CSR scholarship and an explanation of its limited influence. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Industrial relations; United States of America",

While the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) encourages institutions to demonstrate their commitment to ethics through research agendas, the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy proposed a three-course ethics sequence - one of which was a discipline-specific accounting ethics course. The unanswered question is whether or not the accounting academy has the embedded expertise in ethics to teach a discipline-specific accounting ethics course. While there are numerous ways to establish an expertise in the area of ethics, this study documents the level of ethics research by accounting faculty who teach at institutions in North America in 26 business ethics journals and accounting's Top-40 journals. Our data indicate that 683 (546) schools or 75.9 (60.6) percent of the 900 schools in the United States and Canada do not have an ethics scholar if one uses a five-year (20-year) research window.

Being largely a concept embedded in Anglo-American capitalism, however, with its emphasis on voluntary action rather than regulation, the transfer of CSR to the European setting has resulted in some tensions. A range of activities that may fall under CSR in the United States, such as the corporate provision of health care or education, have in Europe been undertaken largely on a tax-financed basis (Matten and Moon, 2008). Additionally, the corporate discretion of CSR is at odds with the more regulated frameworks in many European nations, which grant employees and trade unions a well-defined scope to influence corporate decision-making (Dobbin and Boychuk, 1999; Marsden, 1999; Bamber, Lansbury and Wailes, 2004). The impact of CSR on organised labour in Europe is therefore one of the most interesting examples of the impact an ascendant archetype from a dominant society can have on elements of the national business systems of other countries. Interestingly, this topic is not widely discussed currently, and there seems to be a reluctance in both the industrial relations community to engage actively with CSR (Royle, 2005) and the CSR/business ethics literature to examine the role of trade unions (Preuss, Haunschild and Matten, 2006). Furthermore, there is considerable suspicion among trade unions of CSR, and it is only recently that major players have started engaging with the topic (e.g. Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, 2005).",,

Codes of conducts, which are defined as the business principles to guarantee certain standards, are developed to demonstrate the social responsibility of a company, particularly in terms of health and safety of consumers of the end product. Labels, such as Öko-Tex 100, focus on health and safety standards of a product, and provide information about certain aspects of the product or its production process.

A central tenet of the Austrian school is that non-equilibrium market processes are primarily attributed to the subjective behaviors of entrepreneurs. Yet, human actions are not only determined by entrepreneur's unique preferences and experiences, but they are also determined by the actions of connected others. As a result, subjective explanations of market processes are extended to account for the social relationships of human action. A conceptual model that underscores the social networks of subjective and alert entrepreneurs was developed and examined in an agent based-simulation setting.

No one appears to have tried to explain the phenomenon known as 'business ethics' and the ways that we as a society interact with the concept, therefore, the authors have addressed this gap in the literature by proposing a model of business ethics that the authors hope will stimulate debate. The business ethics model consists of three principal components (i.e. expectations, perceptions and evaluations) that are interconnected by five sub-components (i.e. society expects; organizational values, norms and beliefs; outcomes; society evaluates; and reconnection). The introduced model makes a contribution to the creation of a conceptual framework for business ethics. A few tentative conclusions may be drawn from the introduced model of business ethics. The model aspires to be highly dynamic. The ultimate outcome is dependent upon the evolution of time and contexts. It is also dependent upon and provides reference to the behaviours and perceptions of people. The model proposes business ethics to be a continuous and an iterative process. There is no actual end of the process, but a constant reconnection to the initiation of successive process iterations of the business ethics model. The principals and sub-components of the model construct the dynamics of this continuous process. They provide guidance on what and how to explore our common efforts to understand the phenomenon known as business ethics. The model provides opportunities for further research in the field of business ethics. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conceptual framework; Model of business ethics",

Most of these models do not include a role for law in ethical decision-making, or if law is mentioned, it is set as a boundary constraint, exogenous to the decision process. However, many decision models in business ethics are based on cognitive moral development theory, in which the law is thought to be the external referent of individuals at the level of cognitive development that most people have achieved. Other theoretical bases of ethical decision models, social learning, and experientialism, also imply a role for law that is rarely made explicit. Law is a more important aspect of ethical decision-process models than it appears to be in the models.

It is argued that recent corporate scandals have set a new low for the accounting profession. It is, after all, the accountants who have assisted in financial management, prepared financial statements and audited these statements. As a corollary to this, it can be argued that accountants play a significant role in good corporate governance and ethical sustainable business practices. Increasingly there are calls for greater transparency and corporate governance as well as increased adoption of professional and ethical practices by businesses. Is this possible given our inherently materialistic nature of accumulating wealth? The question must therefore be asked, if new or additional legislation would not work, what will? It has also been argued that poor quality professional education is one of the problems contributing to these scandals. This paper identifies and explores five factors that seemingly influences and contributes to the perpetuation of accounting and corporate scandals because of their impact on ethical behaviour. Also discussed in this paper is the debate related to the inadequacy of university curricula particularly with regard to the influence of ethics education on accounting graduates. To investigate further these issues, we surveyed students to ascertain whether they believe education can influence ethical behaviour. The findings from the surveys could not conclusively indicate that students perceived ethics education to have a significant influence on their ethical behaviour but nonetheless they believed that it was still important to have ethics education in their programme of study. This finding, in itself, suggests that it is still possible to influence the 'thinking' of accounting graduates before they entered the complex world of business. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - A vigorous analysis of extant literature and an investigation of insider dynamics within a new friend/old friend perspective. Findings - Gift-giving is strategic and a foreign businessman must manage its monetary value very cautiously in order to alleviate the ""face"" and provide renqing so as to generate ganging and to obtain cronyism from his Chinese counterpart. In saying that, relativism prevails. A foreign company must establish a zone of ethical tolerance so that its executive knows the limits when practicing gift-giving. In China, an old friend is a supporter and therefore a foreign business should not openly criticize his Chinese counterpart. Frequent visits to China must be maintained. Practical implications - A foreign businessman needs to understand the guanxi dynamics of renqing and ganging and their sequential arrangement in the adaptation mechanism. He should use gift-giving to offer renqing so as to establish ganging with his Chinese counterparts.

In addition to reviewing key research findings on the factors that lead to success and derailment in European organisations, the paper discusses key aspects and outcomes of well-designed leadership development initiatives and how those relate to the ethical issues and problems posed as ""successful"" managers move into more senior levels with the attendant demands and pressures. Design/methodology/approach - The paper involves a qualitative analysis of data on learning and goals set and achieved as part of an international leadership development programme held in Europe. Also included is a summary of previously published research on European success and derailment factors, to provide context for the programme data. Findings - What managers report learning in a leadership development programme, and the goals they set and achieve, are very much in line with theory on avoiding ethical failure in leadership roles. Leadership development supports ethical action by providing participants with opportunities for rich and comprehensive feedback, enhancement of self-awareness, time to reflect on personal and professional relationships, and improved understanding of the nature of strategic processes. Research limitations/implications - It was not possible to track actual ethical/unethical behaviour before or after the programme, a significant direction for future research. Practical implications - Well-designed leadership development may play a more important role than previously thought in supporting ethical action. Originality/value - Ethical violations are often committed by people who have a history of good behaviour, but who are generally not well prepared to face complex issues and the increased power and privilege of the upper ranks.

It explores how alternative stakeholder perspectives lead to differing perceptions of the process and content of responsible reporting. We contrast traditional stakeholder theory, which views stakeholders as external parties having a social contract with corporations, with an emerging perspective, which views interaction among corporations and constituents as relational in nature. This moves the stakeholder from an external entity to one that is integral to corporate activity. We explore how these alternative stakeholder perspectives give rise to different normative demands for stakeholder engagement, managerial processes, and communication. We discuss models of CSR reporting and accountability: EMAS, the ISO 14000 series, SA8000, AA1000, the Global Reporting Initiative, and the Copenhagen Charter. We explore how these models relate to the stakeholder philosophies and find that they are largely consistent with the traditional atomistic view but fall far short of the demands for moral engagement prescribed by a relational stakeholder perspective. Adopting a relational view requires stakeholder engagement not only in prescribing reporting requirements, but also in discourse relating to core aspects of the corporation such as mission, values, and management systems. Habermas' theory of communicative action provides guidelines for engaging stakeholders in this moral discourse. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Discourse ethics; Relational stakeholder perspective; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder reporting; Theory of Communicative Action",

Through stakeholder engagement, stakeseekers may be turned into stakeholders. It has been argued that in the process, critics are simply co-opted. However, corporate objectives are not necessarily monolithic. Conceived as a political coalition of various interests, the structure of the corporation often reflects societal divisions. Parts of the corporation can thus serve as sounding boards for external claims.

The main objective of this paper is present new Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) model for the CS. The new ERM model for CS is offered to be a suitable managerial approach for the Turkish automotive distributor companies. The new ERM model is introduced as a useable way for implementation of corporate sustainability management (CSM) in order to meet financial, strategic operational, ecological and social goals of organizations. In order to meet the requirements of CS specific tools are necessary. The new ERM model is offered as the central tool for the development and implementation of sustainable business strategies for the Turkish automotive distributor companies. In this study, new model has been developed according to my new ERM framework model in doctorate dissertation (2007). This study is contributed to ERM literature and supported for CS efforts in the Turkish Automotive Distributor Companies. In order to developing of a new ERM model, interview with distributor managers is experienced and best ERM practice, CS surveys and ERM guidelines are analyzed. The study is also offered an application of the analytic network process (ANP) for the selection of best ERM operator in the Turkish automotive distributor companies. In order to identification of the best practice criteria to the ERM is realized to interview with high level managers of leading companies, analyzed best ERM practice surveys and ERM guidelines.

The marketing of products deemed ""socially questionable"" or ""sinful"" (like tobacco and alcohol) has long been recognized as posing special ethical challenges (Kotler, P. and S. Levy: 1971, Harvard Business Review 49, 74-80; Davidson, D. K: 1996, Selling Sin: The Marketing of Socially Unacceptable Products (Quorum Press, Westport). We contend that marketers should consider securities (i.e. common stock, options) in a similar vein, as a potentially dangerous product. Given the inherent volatility of equity prices, responsible marketers need to exercise caution and restraint in promoting securities. We evaluate whether the NYSE's current guidelines adequately encourage ethical marketing practices and deter unethical ones. Using recent examples of controversial brokerage advertisements, we expose weaknesses in the Exchange's vague injunction that members not ""mislead"" reasonable people by making ""exaggerated claims"" in their communications. From a moral perspective, we find it troublesome that intentionality need not be present for a promotion to be considered misleading. Also problematic is the continued invocation of the reasonable person standard to judge the propriety of advertisements. We close with some thoughts on improving the quality of securities marketing. We suggest that the NYSE, in the interests of fostering higher ethical behavior among member marketers, may need to revive a marketing code of conduct prevalent on Wall Street in an earlier era. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Advertising; Business ethics; Codes of conduct; Contramarketing; Demarketing; Morality; NYSE; Reasonable person standard; SEC; Self-regulation",

An inductive, longitudinal study of all players involved in a stakeholder conflict identified four clusters of influence tactics that were used by both secondary stakeholders and their target firms: issue raising, issue suppressing, positioning, and solution seeking. The stakeholders studied built elaborate influence chains and worked to direct influence flows. The study contributes to stakeholder theory by offering a refined understanding of both bilateral and mutual-influence tactics, expanding the theory's focus beyond bilateral relationships, and highlighting the use of dependence relationships among multiple embedded organizations to build influence over a specific target, and more generally, an organizational field.

In this paper I put forth the basic principles for a theory of decision-making in organizations, which integrates ethics in the core of the theory. It is based on the work of Juan Antonio Pérez López [1991, Teoría de la Acción humana en las organizaciones (Ediciones Rialp, Madrid), 1993, Fundamentos de la Dirección de Empresas (Ediciones Rialp, Madrid)] and is essentially a humanistic view of the interrelationships between people and its implications for organizational decision-making. I will first show that in any relationship between two people, the learning of the two is crucial for such a relationship to last; and then I will expand on the different aspects of that learning. This analysis will then be applied to the organizational context as a basis for organizational decision-making, Second, it applies the previous analysis to the organizational context as a basis for organizational decision making, showing how any decision in an organization needs to be analyzed on the basis of three criteria (short-run effectiveness, development of distinctive competence, and unity and identification with the organization) and how ethics is included in the last two. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Ethical foundations of organization; Learning; Management theory; Trust",

In the proposed managerial model, moral judgment of the situation is one of the inputs to managerial judgment, among several other inputs regarding costs and benefits of various alternatives. Managerial judgment results in managerial intent leading to managerial action. The model and the effects of taking an ethics course on ethical and managerial judgment and managerial intent were then indirectly tested in this study, wherein subjects judged the ethical wrongness, managerial badness, and the managerial intent regarding decisions made in a case. Forty-nine MBA students analyzed a case involving budget-based bonuses and production, in which the ethical issue evolved over three stages. It appears from the Path-analysis results that managerial judgment mediated between moral judgment and the judgment of managerial intent as suggested by the proposed model, and that taking an ethics course directly affected managerial judgment but did not affect the moral judgment. Additionally, in the first stage of decision-making (early stage of a developing ""ethical slippery slope""), moral judgment did not significantly influence managerial judgment. However, students with ethics course still were more inclined to judge the decision as managerially bad as compared to others, indicating that they were more aware or sensitive to the moral issues involved. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Framing; Judgment and decision-making; Managerial decisions; Schema; Teaching ethics",

This notion captures the slippery slope of wrongdoing as actors engage in increasingly dubious practices. We identify four kinds of individuals along this continuum in corrupt organizations, who range from complete innocence to total guilt. They are innocent bystanders, innocent participants, active rationalizers and guilty perpetrators. Traditional explanations of how individuals move from bystander status to guilty perpetrators usually focus on socialization and institutional factors. In addition to these factors, we propose that the very distance between an act and its ethical consequences (ethical distance) may also play a determining role - if not always in the same way - in the transition process. Having developed this conceptual argument, we conclude with a discussion of managerial and research implications. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Bystander; Corruption; Ethical distance; Rationalization",

Although many nontraditional marketing messages are effective through clever, entertaining, and, ultimately, benign means, others rely on deception to reach consumers. In particular, one form of covert marketing, known as stealth marketing, uses surreptitious practices that fail to disclose or reveal the true relationship with the company producing or sponsoring the marketing message. In addition to deception, stealth marketing can involve intrusion and exploitation of social relationships as means of achieving effectiveness. In this article, the authors consider the ethical implications using three stealth marketing case studies. They cast the discussion in the context of consumer defense mechanisms by employing literature on skepticism and persuasion knowledge to help explain the effectiveness of these practices. The authors identify the ethical problems inherent to stealth marketing and conclude their analysis with recommendations for marketers and public policy makers. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Consumer skepticism; Covert marketing; Deception; Ethics; Stealth marketing",

Design/methodology/approach - Business and psychology students' propensity to engage in unethical behavior (PUB), the love of money, machiavellianism, and risk tolerance at Time 1 and propensity to engage in unethical behavior at Time 2 (four weeks later) were measured. Cluster analysis was used to analyze Time 2 data and bad apples (Cluster 1, high propensity to engage in unethical behavior) and good apples (Cluster 2, low propensity to engage in unethical behavior) were identified. Then all the variables measured at Time 1 were used to predict cluster membership (bad apples vs good apples) measured at Time 2. Findings - In three discriminant analyses, it was found that variables at Time 1 predicted cluster membership at Time 2 for the whole sample and the business sample, but not for the psychology sample. The differences between bad apples and good apples were significant for business students, but not significant for psychology students. Correlation data showed that the love of money was significantly correlated with machiavellianism and risk tolerance. Research limitations/implications - Students are not assigned randomly to business and psychology courses. Students' behavioral intention, not actual unethical behavior, is measured here. Can professors change people's love of money, machiavellianism, risk tolerance, and the propensity to engage in unethical behavior and enhance students' and future managers' ethical decision making? This issue deserves critical attention in future research. Practical implications - It is plausible that corruptions and scandals are caused not by lack of intelligence, but by lack of wisdom, or virtue. Professors and researchers may have to focus on ethics training, in general, and the bad apples in bad (business) barrels (mostly male business students), in particular, identify the most critical time and methods in teaching business ethics, enhance learning based on students' own experiences, and promote ethical values in schools, universities, and organizations. Originality/value - This research shows the importance of incorporating propensity to engage in unethical behavior (PUB), the love of money, machiavellianism, and risk tolerance in identifying bad apples vs good apples across majors.","Psychology; Students; United States of America",

Kohlberg's (1971, in Cognitive Development and Epistemology (Academic Press, New York), 1976, in Moral Development and Behavior: Theory and Research and Social Issues (Holt, Rienhart and Winston, New York)) cognitive moral development (CMD) theory is one explanation of moral reasoning. One unresolved debate on the topic of CMD is the charge that Kohlbergian-type CMD theory is gender biased. This research puts forth the proposal that the issue may be elucidated by exposing an ambiguity in ""gender"" (Borna and White: 2003, Journal of Business Ethics 47, 89-99; Gentile: 1993, Psychological Science 4(2), 120-122; Unger: 1979, American Psychologist 34(11), 1085-1094). We use the Sociomoral Reflective Objective Measure (SROM) to measure CMD and the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) to measure gender as a psychosocial concept, rather than as a biological classification. The results of our study indicate that high femininity, measured as a psychosocial attribute, is associated with significantly lower Kohlbergian-type CMD scores among business practitioners. Sex moderates the effect of gender on CMD, but only indirectly. Our research also reveals that education plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between gender and moral reasoning.

However, the literature has mostly focused on the functionality design and utilitarian value of such decision support systems, mostly ignoring the potential social influence they could exert on their users.The objective of this study is to apply a social relationship perspective to the design of interfaces for PRAs. We investigate the effects of applying anthropomorphic interfaces-namely, humanoid embodiment and voice output-on users' perceived social relationship with a technological and software-based artifact designed for electronic commerce contexts. The findings from a laboratory experiment indicate that using humanoid embodiment and human voice-based communication significantly influences users' perceptions of social presence, which in turn enhances users' trusting beliefs, perceptions of enjoyment, and ultimately, their intentions to use the agent as a decision aid. These results extend the applicability of theories concerning traditional shopper-salesperson relationships to customers' interactions with technological artifacts residing on Web sites-that is, the recommendation agent software-and provide practitioners with guidelines on how to design Internet stores with the goal of building social relationships with online shoppers and enhancing their overall shopping experiences. © 2009 M.E.

Although the principal reasons for construction delays are comparable across developing countries, several factors pertaining to local industry, socio-economic and cultural issues and project characteristics also contribute to construction delays. Questionnaire surveys and interviews were conducted on a major construction project in Thailand to explore the most significant problems causing construction delays. Factors related to designers, contractors and consultants were rated among the top problems. Issues such as lack of resources, poor contractor management, shortage of labour, design delays, planning and scheduling deficiencies, changed orders and contractors' financial difficulties were also highlighted during the interviews. Notably, problems such as 'multicultural and multilingual environment causing ineffective communication', 'large number of participants of project' and 'involvement of several foreign designers and contractors' were rated among the bottom 10 problems in the 75-item problem inventory. These findings can be helpful for project managers to mitigate the construction delays in Thailand.

The hospitality industry has been used as a word to describe the commercial provision of services associated with the provision of food, drink and accommodation in restaurants, bars and hotels. The paper shows that hospitality is rooted in social engagement which in the past has had a profound impact on the behaviours of societies to travellers and strangers. The paper also suggests that the links between domestic and private settings of hospitality are inextricably interwoven with the commercial provision. Often those destined for careers in hospitality first learn the rules and obligations of hosting and hospitableness in the home. Furthermore, the domestic experience of providing food, drink and accommodation in private dwellings also suggests to many would-be entrepreneurs that they have the skills needed to be successful bar-keepers, restaurateurs, or hoteliers. Commercial hospitality provision has been criticized as offering less than authentic hospitality, a pale sham of the real thing which can only be found in domestic settings offered by hosts who are genuinely hospitable. The paper suggests that it is not inevitable that commercial hospitality is necessarily inauthentic. It is possible to learn from more traditional notions of hospitality and apply these in commercial settings.","Commercial hospitality; Domains of hospitality; Hospitableness; Hospitality","corporate strategy; domestic work; service provision"

This survey asked students to respond to four scenarios with potentially unethical business behavior and a string of questions related to the importance of ethics in business strategy and in personal behaviors. Based on arguments related to differences in recent historical experiences, the authors suggest that student responses may be as different within the East Asian (Confucian) environment as they are between this environment as a whole and the USA. Survey results indicate a greater perception of ethical problems and more importance placed on ethics per se in business practices, as well as less of an emphasis on social harmony (a key distinguishing characteristic of Confucian values identified in prior research) on the part of USA students. At the same time, substantial national differences in response are also witnessed within the set of East Asian students. A priori expectations as to the manner in which these East Asian responses should vary based on differences in recent historical experiences are partially, but not fully, supported. The authors argue that the key value of the reported research rests on a demonstration that national differences within a common cultural (e.g., East Asian or Confucian) area can be as great as differences across cultural (East vs. West) areas and that practitioners of global business must fine-tune their expectations as to acceptable business and personal actions to accommodate specific national historical experiences to be effective. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Confucianism",

The excess equity investment is gauged with respect to industry average. The abnormal equity investment is specifically referred to the number of nominal investment companies that are fully controlled by the controlling owners while subject to little governance. Our empirical evidences of 345 Taiwanese non-financial listed firms show that firm's excess and abnormal equity investments are negatively correlated with controlling shareholder's cash flow rights while are positively correlated with the control-cash flow deviation, and board affiliation. The results are supportive of the positive incentive hypothesis and the negative entrenchment hypothesis put forth by La Porta et al. (2002, Journal of Finance 57, 1147-1171) and Claessen et al. (2002, Journal of Finance 57, 2741-2742). The negative relation between equity investment and firm's value further supports the agency postulation that corporate excess and abnormal equity investments represent a leeway for controlling shareholder to exploit wealth of minority shareholders. This study potentially contributes to the literature of business ethics by portraying an empirically testable linkage from controlling owner's ethical choices to his actions and therefore firm's value. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate equity investment; Corporate governance; Ethical choices; Negative entrenchment ypothesis; Positive incentive hypothesis",

Curiously, the psychological underpinnings of a customer's perception of community with other users of the brand remain unexplored.

The aims of the paper are: to determine and to measure the system of resources of value developed by employees of a company that has developed a stakeholder management policy; to create a model that permits the company to evaluate the factors which have a major effect on the development of such a system; and to define the applications of the tool as a company's performance measurement and control system. Design/methodology/ approach - In order to pursue these aims two surveys were conducted in 2005 and 2006 on the employees of a leading Italian company in the agricultural food sector. Structural equation model methodology and multivariate analysis were used to define the quantitative measures of the system of resources and to determine the role played by stakeholder management policies in the development of the intangible resources. Findings - The authors found that the company's social policies have a significant influence, even though its intensity varies, on most of the resources analyzed, and in particular on trust, job satisfaction, networking and communication, ability to work in a group and low turnover propensity. These results confirm the strong link between the resources of value developed by employees and the social strategy of the company. Originality/value - The measurement system developed in this research can be used in any firm that wants to measure the intangible resources related to employees and represents a control tool that may support managers in planning and control the social investments of the firm. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Human resource management; Multivariate analysis; Performance measures; Stakeholder analysis",

Various types of organization-stakeholder relationship are outlined, from market-based (e.g. ethical consumerism) to participative (e.g. consultation and coalition). This organization-stakeholder network constitutes the problematic system of concern. The concept of responsibility and its attribution is critically considered, as is the likelihood of valueconflicts between members of this wider system. The tendency for 'corporate social responsibility' (CSR) to be managed hierarchically within organizations, characterized by an over-reliance on enforced codes of conduct is critiqued on ethical and practical grounds. It is argued that individuals require a capacity for moral judgement in applying codes and, more generally, when resolving conflict and dilemmas within the wider system of organization-stakeholder relations. An appropriate approach from ethical theory is therefore offered. The paper concludes with a summary of aspects of CSR to which the systems discipline could usefully contribute.

In this paper, we present a framework based on actor-network theory (ANT) for analysing these processes. The developed framework is illustrated in a study of the redefinition of Swedish garment retailers' responsibilities for workers' rights at suppliers' factories between 1996 and 2004. We show that definition processes can be characterized as battles for the right to interpretation, and that traditionally non-dominant actors can, at least temporarily, win these battles and dictate the development of the processes for defining corporate responsibility. We also show that definition processes can take an exclusionary form prohibiting certain actors from participating.

First, the holistic dilemma of addressing triple bottom line interests in economic, social and environmental issues. This speaks to a 'framework for understanding' in making sense of interrelationships between entities in a complex reality ('getting real'). Second, the dilemma of nurturing cooperation amongst stakeholders having diverse viewpoints. This speaks to a 'framework for practice' in fostering engagement between multiple perspectives based on different boundaries ('getting it right').A third dilemma of CSR is presented in terms of 'getting a grip' - a concern that speaks to a 'framework for responsibility' in addressing the moral dilemma that any methodology, approach, system or framework can neither be entirely holistic nor appropriately conversant with all perspectives. With this caveat in mind, the paper examines one particularly significant systems tool for addressing CSR dilemmas - critical systems heuristics (CSH). Applying the triadic framework, the potential value of CSH for CSR is surfaced from two contrasting perspectives - the CSR advocate and the CSR adversary.

We start by explaining how some of these companies have violated the human rights of Chinese citizens to freely trade information. We then analyze whether the justifications and excuses offered by these companies are sufficient to absolve them of moral responsibility. We argue that both justifications and excuses offered are insufficient.

Drawing upon the concept of governmentality, the case study data are analysed in order to understand how and why the self-management programme hampered the exercise of employee voice in the social accounting cycle. The paper suggests that neo-liberal forms of government, such as self-management, can align employer and employee interests in a way that marginalizes the impact of social accounting from an employee perspective. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its manifold manifestations and interpretations make its learning interesting whilst at the same time challenging. This paper reflects on the use of systems thinking to develop business students' awareness and intervention skills on CSR issues. To develop our approach, we consider three areas of CSR that we think need attention. These are (1) the incorporation of CSR issues into organizational purposes; (2) stakeholder management when thinking about CSR and (3) assessment of CSR impacts on society. Our approach shows how key systems thinking ideas and methodologies have helped us to facilitate discussion about these elements in the classroom.

In this article, we examine one common form of internet fraud, the practice of shill bidding (when a seller in an auction enters a bid on his or her own item). The significant incidence of shill bidding on eBay (in spite of the fact that it is illegal just as it is in live auctions) exemplifies the current ineffectiveness of regulatory means as well as the lack of effective societal mechanisms to prevent online fraud. Further, the proliferation of shill bidding along with other types of internet fraud may have broader implications. If unethical behavior such as shill bidding becomes too widespread on the internet, regulators and other societal forces may deem it necessary to institute controls that will impact the entire online marketplace as well as the future development and regulation of business activities on the internet. Our results indicate that shill bidding is perpetrated on eBay significantly more often than 0.1% rate of fraud estimated by the firm. This suggests that regulators, users, and others stakeholders may become concerned enough to act. The impact of those responses on the internet of the future may affect a broad array of users beyond the unethical sellers on eBay. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Internet fraud; Online auctions; Shill bidding",

Voluntary reporting has been characterised by a dearth of neutral and objective information such that the advocates of SEER recommend that it be made compulsory. Their underlying rationale is that legally specified disclosure requirements and enforcement mechanisms will enhance the quality of such reporting. This paper sets out to explore how realistic this scenario actually is, in view of the conflicting interpretations in the literature on this subject. To that end, a survey of the reporting patterns of 78 of the largest Spanish companies between 2001 and 2003 examines the extent of their compliance with the ICAC-2002 standard, which obliged them to make environmental disclosures in their financial statements. The results suggest that progressive and improved regulation could increase the volume and quality of SEER disclosures. They also suggest, however, that persistent non-compliance means that the problems associated with voluntary disclosure still exist. Finally, through an impression management perspective, the study reveals, the diverse strategies, ranging from dismissal to concealment, that are employed by companies to avoid transparency. As regulation improves and enforcement expectations rise, it becomes more difficult to dismiss compulsory reporting norms. As a result, some firms engage in more complex concealment strategies to attain corporate legitimacy, depriving stakeholders of regulatory information. The latter point serves to reconcile apparently contradictory explanations in the literature as to whether legitimacy theory might explain partial compliance with SEER regulation. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accountability; Business ethics; Ethical and environmental reporting; Mandatory environmental disclosure; Social; Spain",

In contrast to models that characterize institutions as organizational structures, roles, and patterns of exchange, this model depicts institutions as constituted primarily through the active working and reworking of relationships. Rather than adopt the network literature's focus on the overall pattern of relationships and exchanges carried out between policy actors, the author focuses directly on the nature of the relationships themselves and portrays the institution as the playing out of these relationships, employing Carol Gilligan's notion of care.

On this model, achieving a high level of capability largely depends on managerial ability to effectively bargain with stakeholders and establish solidarity vis-à-vis the successful negotiation, implementation, and execution of ""win-win"" transactional exchanges. Against this account, it is rightly pointed out that a transactional explanation of stakeholder relationships, regarded by many as the bottom line for stakeholder management, fails to provide managerial direction regarding how to resolve a variety of normative stakeholder claims that resist commoditization. In response to this issue, this paper has two overlapping goals. It seeks to elaborate a discourse theoretical approach to the problem by first drawing out Jurgen Habermas' theory of communicative action and delineating the various types of rational discourse. Second, the paper attempts to present concrete implications for SMC relative to reshaping the contours of rational, process, and transactional analysis in light of central discourse theoretical conclusions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Communicative action; Critical theory; Discourse ethics; Stakeholder management capability; Stakeholder management theory",

It can be seen from a strategic management perspective aimed at capturing knowledge, increasing ownership of the project by users, reducing conflict, encouraging innovation and facilitating spin-off partnerships. From an ethical perspective, meaningful stakeholder engagement can be seen to enhance inclusive decision making, promote equity, enhance local decision making and build social capital. The benefits from both of these perspectives are vital for sustainability; however, stakeholder engagement can also be seen from the perspective of an opportunity for social learning-a social process where diverse stakeholders share a common forum, learn about each other's values, reflect upon their own values and create a shared vision and shared objectives. Dialogue is also useful in increasing awareness, changing attitudes and affecting behaviours. Existing practices view stakeholder engagement: mostly from a management perspective; sometimes from an ethical perspective; less often as a combination of the two; and rarely have any element of the social learning perspective. There is a need for an approach that combines all the three perspectives if sustainability is to be pursued.

Resource-based models of competitive strategy do not explicitly embrace a particular economic paradigm, but to the extent their conceptualization rests on neoclassical assumptions such as imperfect factor markets and profits as rents, these models also imply a trade-off between competitive advantage and corporate social responsibility. Differences in Austrian/evolutionary economic model's assumptions about equilibrium, profits, and other economic concepts allow this paradigm to embrace alternative views of strategy such as the activities or dynamic capabilities views. These alternative views of strategy focus on learning and adaptation; they align more easily with corporate social responsibility.

The implications for stakeholders of the all pervasive drive for globalization in the construction industry is reviewed, leading to a consideration of the ethical relationship interfaces that construction organizations have with their stakeholders from the viewpoint of ethics, social contracts and corporate responsibility.

The aim of the research presented here was to show the factors affecting the stakeholder management process positively or negatively from the perspective of project implementation. A comparative study of two railway projects in Sweden was undertaken to analyse these factors. The study showed that the outcome of the stakeholder management process depended mainly upon how well the project managers presented the benefits and negative consequences brought on by the construction project. Techniques and tools exist for this purpose, but must be appropriate, and these are discussed in the context of the two projects. The challenge for project managers is to implement the project in such a way that the effects of negative impacts are minimized and, if possible, the benefits for all stakeholders are maximized.

The findings of the research show that perceptions vary significantly across professional groups as well as high and low performing managers.

This may appear somewhat paradoxical to the reader as project managers, traditionally, have been seen to attempt to mollify stakeholders while focusing their attention on the details of project management rather than to empower stakeholders to have a significant input to the project-empowerment being seen to encourage 'interference' from non-specialists into the managers' domain. This change in attitude to stakeholders marks a culture change in the real estate and construction industry, brought about by an increased emphasis on relationship management. The research reported in this paper looks at the issues of stakeholder management via a research model that has identified project contextual factors which, through perceptual processes, influence empowerment and so the outcomes of the project. Hence, the problem addressed is how and why relationship management and stakeholder management are different in two unique cultures and what elements can be considered common and what elements are different.","Australia; Empowerment; Hong Kong; Relationship management; Stakeholder management model","Construction industry; Managers; Project management; Research; Australia; Contextual factors; Culture change; Empowerment; Hong Kong; Organizational cultures; Project management process; Project managers; Project success; Real estates; Relationship management; Research models; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder management model; Management; construction industry; empowerment; modeling; project management; stakeholder; Asia; Australasia; Australia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Hong Kong"

Our answer to ""why"" provides both a response to those who oppose business ethics courses and a direction for course content. We believe a solid, comprehensive course in business ethics should address not only moral philosophy, ethical dilemmas, and corporate social responsibility - the traditional pillars of the disciple - but also additional areas necessary to make sense of the goings-on in the business world and in the news. These ""new pillars,"" that we advocate include moral psychology, organizational design and behavior, motivational theory, and a unit on how society, business, and law interact. This last unit builds upon the work of Francis P. McHugh (1988) who urged an integration of ""disciplines related to business ethics."" Our seventh pillar would encompass an integration of law, socio-political theory, and policy to demonstrate how business helps construct its own regulatory framework.

Clients need to choose an appropriate form of contract from available common options, like fixed price, design and build (D&B), and design, build, finance and operate (DBFO). Facilitating appropriate choices is usefully addressed within a balanced incentive and risk sharing (BIARS) contract framework, 'balance' implying incentives that align client and contractor objectives. What this means in operational terms, within the context of a best practice approach to project risk and uncertainty management, is explored and clarified. The work is based on a mix of conventionally funded academic research and consultancy-based research. It was stimulated by the need to explain these ideas to a client using target contracts with unbalanced risk sharing, a common practice. Best practice requires a balanced approach, and the difference is significant. Best practice also involves a number of other relevant features. The key conclusion is that full integration of contract choice decisions and other aspects of a best practice approach to risk and uncertainty management is practical and advantageous, and a reasonable next step in the evolution of best practice.","Contract conditions; Risk management","Clarification; Construction industry; Contracts; Finance; Investments; Occupational risks; Risk management; Academic researches; Best Practices; Construction projects; Contract conditions; Design and build; Fixed price; Full integration; Project risks; Risk and uncertainties; Risk sharing; Stakeholder management; Project management; best management practice; construction industry; project management; risk assessment; stakeholder"

A generic project uncertainty management process framework is employed to provide a structure for a review of approaches to analysing stakeholders and related uncertainty management issues. This framework, the SHAMPU (Shape, Harness, and Manage Project Uncertainty) process, consists of nine phases: project definition, focusing the uncertainty management process, identifying sources of uncertainty, structuring issues, clarifying ownership, estimating variability, evaluating implications of uncertainty, harnessing plans, and managing implementation. A variety of approaches to stakeholder analysis are considered in relation to these phases. In particular, characterizing projects on a 'hard-soft' spectrum suggests generic strategies for managing stakeholder expectations and fostering trust between stakeholders.

Data from 200 managers across multiple organizations and industries demonstrated that managers predominantly adopt a utilitarian perspective when forming ethical intent across a series of business ethics vignettes. Consistent with expectations, managers utilizing a balanced linear/nonlinear thinking style demonstrated a greater overall willingness to provide ethical decisions across ethics vignettes compared to managers with a predominantly linear thinking style. However, results comparing the ethical decision-making of balanced thinking managers and nonlinear thinking managers were generally inconsistent across the ethics vignettes. Unexpectedly, managers utilizing a balanced linear/nonlinear thinking style were least likely to adopt an act utilitarian rationale for ethical decision-making across the vignettes, suggesting that balanced thinkers may be more likely to produce ethical decisions by considering a wider range of alternatives and ruling out those that are justified solely on the basis of their outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach - While the network analysis enabled examination of the interconnectedness of stakeholders, the stakeholder approach identified the critical stakeholders in destination development. These two approaches helped determine how the existing relationship structures of destination stakeholders might influence sustainable destination development. Findings - The destination marketing/management organizations (DMOs) and stakeholders with access to or possession of critical resources have the highest centrality in urban destinations. In all three clusters, local government and DMOs are perceived to hold the greatest legitimacy and power over others in destination development.

The resulting propositions are examined in the context of a longitudinal case study of the United Airlines and US Airways abandoned merger in 2000-2001 Findings - The paper's analysis demonstrates that initial conditions are accentuated by the sequence of actions, offering a plausible explanation for process outcomes. Practical implications - On the practical side, the paper provides a problem-solving tool for stakeholder management to analyze the stakeholder linkages during strategic initiatives. Originality/value - The paper addresses an important research gap, exploring how stakeholder-related path dependencies influence the process of conflict escalation.","Acquisitions and mergers; Airlines; Case studies; Stakeholder analysis",

Design/methodology/approach - To provide an answer to the question the CSR literature is examined from both theoretical and practical perspectives. This paper offers a broad general review and practical assessment of contemporary thinking about CSR. It investigates three precise questions. These are: who pays for CSR, who makes decisions about CSR, and what are the long-term, potential implications of CSR? Findings - The three most relevant theoretical frameworks are each found wanting. In particular, none offers managers clear operational guidance. So, although CSR is recognised as morally attractive, it is judged unhelpful to force it on business through regulatory or legislative means. From the questions posed it is revealed that answers to the first two questions are quite clear. The answer to the third is conjecture. The paper finds that none of these questions has yet received adequate attention. The paper offers three main findings: that CSR has costs which may go unrecognised; that it draws managers into decisions which may lie outside their competence; and, if it were widely adopted on a major scale, CSR would have implications for government and civil society which we have scarcely begun to think about. Practical implications - At the same time, the proven capacity of business to contribute to society through discretionary expenditure is huge. The paper therefore concludes that it is sensible to encourage business to do more. It follows that CSR should be popularised but not imposed. Originality/value - The paper provides useful information on CSR as a business duty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate image; Corporate social responsibility",

Results supported our contention that multinational enterprises (MNEs) need to be substantially committed to social performance objectives if they are to recoup the cost of their CSP investments, and improve their capacity to compete in foreign markets. MNEs engaged in intermediate levels of CSP achieve lower levels of multinationality than firms operating at either anchor of the social performance continuum.

The business value has four determinants with risk exposure, revenue protection, cost reduction, and revenue growth. ADL thinks that a sustainable business is an organization that is successful in the short, medium, and the long term. The value of a certain company can be increased by actively looking for ways to better enhance the company's performance.

Few buyers, but most florists, have expert knowledge of the flowering time, scent, price, and nature of each flower, and are experts in arranging flowers that meet a given purpose. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate handling constraints into the inference process of a kansei engineering system. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper collected the expert knowledge concerning nature of flowers, composing flower arrangements and social manners on gifts from specialists of flower arrangements including a florist and special books. At the same time, kansei evaluation experiments on the kinds of flowers and colors were conducted. The expertise and the results of kansei experiments were organized into a flower database and inference rules for choice of a main flower, arrangement shapes and combination flowers.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a survey of tax professionals in Hong Kong. Findings - The paper finds that Machiavellianism affects tax advisors' expressed viewpoints toward the importance of corporate ethics and social responsibility, which affect professional judgements toward aggressive tax minimisation. As anticipated, high Machiavellians are more likely to endorse the traditional ""stockholder view"" of corporate responsibility (which holds that corporations have little responsibility beyond maximising their profits), and less likely to support the ""stakeholder view"" (which recognises corporate responsibilities to a broader range of potential stakeholders). The stockholder view (but not the stakeholder view) of corporate responsibility mediates the relationship between Machiavellianism and ethical/social responsibility judgements. Machiavellianism also had significant direct effects on ethical and social responsibility judgements. Originality/value - The paper provides insights into the decision processes used to justify aggressive tax minimisation strategies. The findings indicate that commonly articulated views toward corporate ethics and social responsibility may be used to support unethical strategies. In particular, the finding that the stockholder view mediates the relationship between Machiavellianism and ethical/social responsibility judgements suggests that the stockholder view may be adopted to rationalise overly aggressive tax avoidance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Hong Kong; Political theory; Tax planning",

This continued debate allows the buck to be passed. The paper aims to propose a shift in view from corporate social responsibility to corporate social performance (CSP) as a means to assess CSR policies and practices. A harmful product category was chosen to illustrate how corporate social performance using a consumer's point-of-view can be assessed. Design/methodology/approach - Literature concerned with alcohol knowledge was used to design a survey to consider whether consumers were adequately informed about alcohol. A convenience sample was used to survey Australian adults. A total of 217 surveys were analysed. Findings - Australian alcohol marketers are currently considered socially responsible promoting an ""enjoy responsibly message"" amongst many other policies and programs. A shift in view from corporate social responsibility to corporate social performance (CSP) would change the outcome. Consumers are not fully aware of safe consumption levels of alcohol and these data are consistent with US and UK studies. A shift in view would suggest that companies need to revise their policies and practices. Research limitations/implications - This study was based on a small convenience sample that varied slightly from the Australian population. Future studies, on a larger scale, are required to ensure representativeness, while replication in other countries is encouraged. Practical implications - To meet their social obligations, marketers must ensure consumers are armed with sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the sustainability approach of a sample of 52 Spanish listed firms. This process is based on the study of different indexes generated in order to evaluate the company's commitment through its stakeholders, the social and financial performance of these organisations, and the relationship between them. Previous results showed a positive and not significant relationship between these variables and a positive financial performance. This paper replicates a former research by introducing a fuzzy- logic-based methodology in order to generate the aforementioned indexes. Findings - The current results support the conclusions formerly obtained and simultaneously demonstrate that big Spanish companies are at an incipient stage of development of a clearly sustainability-oriented management. Research limitations/implications - The unavailability of a long series of organisations' sustainability information is an obstacle for a broader analysis. This research could motivate the usefulness of the fuzzy logic methodology for analysing the business sustainability approach and to develop studies on the corporate social performance.

In the absence of any objective measure of a firm's CSR Performance (CSP), their investment choices are largely guided by independent rating indices that rank firms according to their social performance metrics. As a result, firms looking to increase their attractiveness as targets of social investment focus their CSR efforts on increasing the visibility of activities that are recognised by such indices. However, the validity of these indices as accurate measures of firms' actual social performance has repeatedly been called into question. This means that the ability of these indices to measure and report on firms' actual social impact cannot be ascertained with any degree of accuracy. The result is that firms are incentivised to engage in activities (whether genuine or 'greenwashing') that cannot be said to improve social responsibility, and may even ultimately harm society. Thus, another method of measuring CSP must be found that enables firms to measure their true impact on society. We propose a new approach to measuring CSP that is integrated with stakeholder theory. Such an approach provides managers of firms with an interest in engaging in real social development for the purposes of ensuring firm survival with the ability to understand their social obligations, and the ability to measure the resulting benefit to society. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.","Corporate social performance; Corporate Social Responsibility; CSR; Salient stakeholders; Social indices",

Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the principles involved and contrasts them with examples of unethical behaviour in the news at present. The paper presents the practical application of ethical business values through case studies from different organisations where ethical values are part of a positive strategy to achieve competitive advantage. There is an analysis of the case against and for ethical values, a discussion of how business ethics can be part of an organisation's strategy, the evidence that non-executive directors and others may find of ethical behaviour in business decisions, a discussion of ethics in an international context and a short checklist of questions to provide readers with a guide to the ""ethical health"" of the organisation. Findings - The arguments in favour of defining ethical values within business are persuasive. Practical implications - There are examples from experience together with clear guidance about how to manage ethical values in business. Readers could start with the ethical health checklist of questions, decide how their ethical values statement, if any, compares with the examples in the papers, conduct an audit of an existing ethical strategy to identify if their values statement is being translated into behaviours throughout the organization, and test the impact of the ethical values strategy on the competitive position of the business. Originality/value - The paper is educational and therefore provides value to senior managers and directors in a concise but comprehensive overview of the topic that is of current concern in the business world. It points to practical actions they can take in this respect. It could be a thought starter to managers discussing the topic at an away day for example, or for strategic leaders to discuss how to use ethical values to develop a competitive position. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Ethics",

Here I advance an alternative view, founded on the Montreal School of organizational communication's conception of conversation-text relations, yet extending it in several ways. In developing a communicative theory of the firm, I highlight the functions of, and relations between, 'concrete' and 'figurative' texts, paying particular attention to their participation in the construction of an authoritative (yet never monolithic) system for cooriented and distributed action. Using examples drawn from struggles over power, strategy, and organizational form at GM, I show that seeing the firm in textual terms presents a very different view of its operations. Doing so, portrays individuals and collectives as engaging in sophisticated games where firms marshal consent and attract capital through textually mediated practice. Moreover, through game playing, the firm's trajectory is authored. Building on these arguments, I present two novel and testable propositions about the nature of organizational change in interfirm and stakeholder relationships. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Capital; Communication; Consent; Coorientation; Game playing; Intertextuality; Stakeholder dialogue; Text",

This study seeks to add to the understanding of the relationship through a questionnaire survey on Malaysian Christians in business. The questionnaire taps into three different constructs. The religiousness construct is reflected in the level of participation in various common religious activities. The love of money construct is captured through the Love of Money Scale as used in Luna-Arocas and Tang [Journal of Business Ethics 50 (2004) 329]. Response to 25 business vignettes taken from Conroy and Emerson [Journal of Business Ethics 50 (2004) 383] would surface ethical attitudes. A convenience sample of 300 was drawn from three large churches in the Kuala Lumpur area each with a congregation exceeding 1000 together with some representation from the smaller churches. The study finds some differences in the ethical attitudes of Malaysian Christians in business with different levels of religiousness. The study also finds that those longer in the faith are less accepting of unethical behavior. As such it can be concluded that there are ethical attitude differences between Christians in business with different levels of religiousness. This lends support to the claim of a positive relationship between religion and business ethics. The more significant finding is that even within a somewhat homogenous religious group there are different love of money profiles resulting in significant differences in ethical attitudes. This suggests that moderating money attitudes can contribute towards stronger ethical attitudes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Christians in business; Love of money; Religious activities; Religiousness",

The problem has been the lack of a philosophical base or the inadequate implementation of it. We are trying to solve this problem by examining the roots of ethics and then applying it to the business environment. The root that has been undeservedly overlooked has been the concept of free will, the oldest philosophical problem on which every ethics theory lies. We have chosen two theories that we think would be the best base for business ethics. We will shortly present the others. Since free will presents the core of business ethics, business ethicists must first agree on which theory to implement. Aristotle's and Aquinas' theory of free will best amplify the core of economic theory, because it gives reason a central and most important role in the theory. The concept of free will is mainly philosophical as is business ethics so the article follows this tradition, but we tried to give business examples where possible. We do not give a final conclusion because it should be reached by debate and mutual agreement between business ethicists. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aquinas; Aristotle; Ethics; Free will; Managers; Reason; Virtue",

A discourse analysis of six texts reveals three inter-connected yet distinct ways in which gender is talked about. First, the awareness discourse attempts to be inclusive of gender yet reiterates stereotypes in its portrayal of women. Second, within the individualisation discourse, formerly discriminatory elements of gender lose their importance but a gender dimension reappears within the idea of 'Brand You'. Third, in the new ideal discourse, women are constructed as ideal workers of the future. The article argues that there is little space within this web of discourses for an awareness of the continued inequalities experienced by women in relation to men to be voiced and that this rhetorical aporia contributes to a 'post-feminist' climate. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Discourse analysis; Gender; Management; Organisational theory; Post-feminism",

Yet the desire for more income remains a powerful motive among many people at all income levels. Is this simply because many people are misinformed and believe that higher incomes will make them happier, or are they motivated by something other than the pursuit of happiness? This paper argues for the latter. The paper begins by exploring this question, reviewing the literature on income and subjective well-being, and discussing of the role of utility in decision making. This paper then argues that three main factors lead us to value increased income even if it does not make us happier. First, happiness is just one value among many, and not the only conscious goal people set for themselves. Second, even when people are striving to maximize happiness, our tendency to overweight short-term payoffs leads us to overvalue the short-term rewards that income provides. Finally, I argue that our values-based decision making competes with other motivational systems and evolutionary drives. Three evolutionary desires are discussed: (1) to store resources, (2) to be sexually attractive, and (3) to manage our social relationships and our personal identity within those relationships. While all three motivations play a role in our desire for increased income, this paper argues that it is the third - the use of money and consumption as a social tool - that has the most important overall influence on our desire for increased income past the point where it ceases to increase personal happiness. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The initial research demonstrated a need to define ""innovation"" as well as recognise the approach of ""creative people"" in business by exploring existing literature. This was followed by a series of structured interviews with nine British Fashion Designers in London, and three with intermediaries aimed at putting the designers' activities within a business context: a fashion PR; a lawyer specialising in fashion business and a creative director of a fashion distributor. Findings - The research suggests ten survival strategies employed by fashion designers. The five fashion designers in a sustainable business all operated all of these principles. Those no longer in business operated between one and five of these principles. As designers gain experience and realise their ""value"", there is evidence that they can get leverage for contractual agreements with licensors, which has led to financial growth of the designers' businesses. Strategies for diversification and consultancy, if managed without diluting design values, have also led to business growth and stability. Research limitations/implications - Further research is required to consider innovation and entrepreneurship in the different creative and cultural industries, particularly concerning issues and challenges for the creative person. Practical implications - The implications are that designers need to be quick to understand the business and wider environment in which they are operating. More published material needs to be widely available to them concerning role models and business models relevant to this unique and problematic industry.

Design/methodology/approach - Primary data were obtained via a self-administered mail questionnaire distributed to a census of the top 500 private sector organizations based on revenue in each country. Findings - The research identified some interesting findings that showed that the small group of companies in Turkey that have a code may appear to be more ""advanced"" in ethics artifacts usage than Sweden. Such a conclusion is counter-intuitive as one would have expected a developed nation like Sweden to be more advanced in these measures than a developing nation such as Turkey.

On the one hand, people's dealings with rubbish are very much a reflection of historically determined political, economical, and social relationships in the village, region, and country at large; on the other hand, rubbish negotiation have become one of the vital subjects in the process of construction and reconstruction of these relationships and the social space generally. This article explores the ways in which rubbish produces order and classifies what and who is ""out of place"" and what and who is ""of the place."" The presented accounts illustrate people's never ending negotiations over who is responsible for dumping rubbish and who is responsible for it not being removed. When talking about these issues people delineate a multiplicity of contradictions and shift the responsibility from ""state"" to ""locality"" and from ""locality"" to ""state,"" from communal to individual and from individual to communal, from foreigners to locals and from locals to foreigners. All these conceptualizations are quite complex and depend on the social and cultural background of the speaker. With the expansion of tourism and related growth in owners of tourist facilities, seasonal workers, emigrants, and tourists in recent years, questions about who or what is ""out of place"" and who or what is ""of the place"" become even more relevant. While the coastal place serves as the source for this kind of negotiations, the negotiations themselves also construct this coastal place, on which local people who claim to originate from Dhërmi/Drimades situate their belonging.

The aim of the research is to discover how well-known Estonian business leaders perceive the purpose of business activities, corporate relations with the society and environment and who they consider the most significant stakeholders. These issues are studied and analyzed during a ten-year period in the real-life Estonian business environment. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical part of the paper is based on the results of in-depth interviews with 26 top Estonian managers and owners, often known as generalists. The paper discusses the results of qualitative research conducted among these business leaders, owners and top-managers in Estonian organizations, exploring how business purposes and interests, relations with the society and environment as well as different stakeholders are perceived and how these perceptions have changed in Estonia during the period of ten years (1995-2004). Findings - This paper shows how business purposes, interests, corporate relations with the society and environment as well as with different stakeholders are perceived in a rapidly developing former post-socialist and now EU member state, Estonia. It was revealed that stakeholder interests and corporate relations with the society and environment in business have not yet been considered important issues in business organizations. According to the results, the stakeholder thinking and stakeholder concepts have just recently became recognized and understood among the Estonian business leaders. There is a clear difference seen in two periods studied in this research. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of the study is related to survey methodology. In-depth interviews are conducted with 26 representatives; this sets limits to the possibility to generalize the results. In further research, the aim is to get more data through structured questionnaires thus enabling to conduct quantitative analysis and draw conclusions based on larger amount of respondents. Practical implications - In order to stay sustainable and be able to develop further there is a need for Estonian business leaders and organizations to start paying more attention to the different stakeholders, and see the organizations as a part of the environment and society.

Design/methodology/approach - Literature review and meta-analysis of current trends has been used to create a conceptual basis for current quality management questions. Findings - A large part of the development of the quality concept and quality management has taken place without much consideration of what quality management really is or should be. Over time their definitions have been widened to incorporate wellbeing of society, the environment and future generations. Whereas top managers need to address all parts of business, there is a need to separate quality issues from other issues. It is believed that there is a need for quality experts and a discipline of quality management. Quality excellence with a strong customer focus should be one prerequisite to attain true business excellence. There are of course legitimate reasons to address issues as organizational and global sustainability, human rights, financial stability and environmental protection. To properly address these issues, concepts such as business management or stakeholder management might be more appropriate. Originality/value - In the paper, the point is made that there is a need for quality management focusing on its core purpose: management of quality to provide customer satisfaction. In relation to current trends of adding aspects into quality management to develop concepts that are mere dialectal variants to the original, this ""back-to-basics"" approach is novel. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business excellence; Customers; Six sigma; Stakeholder analysis; Total quality management","Customer satisfaction; Environmental engineering; Environmental protection; Management; Quality control; Sales; Sustainable development; Business excellence; Business management; Current quality; Current trends; Customer focus; Customers; Design/methodology/approach; Financial stability; Future generations; Global sustainability; Human rights; Literature reviews; Management of quality; Meta-analysis; Six sigma; Stakeholder analysis; Stakeholder management; Total quality management; Wellbeing; Quality management"

In this conceptual article, the authors assess strategic CSR initiatives, inquiring into the conditions that might give rise to a sustainable competitive advantage in social performance. In what circumstances does a firm's CSR initiative create a first-mover advantage, and when should a firm prefer an early- or late-adopter position? Using the resource-based view and the asymmetries approach of first-mover advantages, the authors propose that for a CSR initiative to lead to a sustainable first-mover advantage, it must be central to the firm's mission, provide firm-specific benefits, and be made visible to external audiences. These strategic attributes generate internal sustainability and must be complemented to ensure external defensibility by a firm's ability to assess its environment, manage its stakeholders, and deal with social issues.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; First-mover advantage; Resource-based view; Stakeholder management; Sustainable strategic advantage",

These two approaches supplement each other. It is demonstrated that issue-focussed stakeholder management dominates in multi-stakeholder networks, because it enables corporations to address complex problems and challenges in cooperation with stakeholders. Since deliberation is the key to issue-focussed stakeholder management, it helps to cope with numerous and at times contradictory stakeholder demands and enhances the legitimacy of corporate activities. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conflict management; Corporate citizenship; Deliberation; Issue management; Multi-stakeholder network; Stakeholder dialogue; Stakeholder management",

But how and why exactly do corporations increasingly mobilise resources to disasters? Organisational researchers continue to lack basic descriptive data as well as theoretical frameworks to respond to these basic questions. This paper responds to this need by presenting descriptive research findings regarding a series of programmes designed to mobilise corporate resources to disasters. We conduct a first-order analysis of these data, and then reflect on the findings in light of existing theories of Corporate Social Performance (CSP), resilience and intangible assets. Based on these reflections, we develop a new theory that frames the mobilisation of corporate resources to disasters as a strategic attempt to develop interdependent resilience as a common intangible asset.

The practice is evaluated in terms of the strategic management model and the sustainability model. While strategic management considerations may be recognized in all elements of the dialogue practice, sustainability considerations are less prominent. It is concluded that corporate stakeholder dialogues with environmental NGOs have a high instrumental value for strategic management. For corporate environmental sustainability, however, current dialogues are a possible but not a necessary instrument. Nonetheless, the apparent learning process among the individual participants might be the added value of stakeholder dialogue in sustainability terms.

After decades of proactive response to change, starting in 1976 the pulp industry experienced a rapid and significant restructuring. In 1992, and after a prolonged hold on local investments, came a large-scale investment with major labor reductions, which created a local crisis. The aim of this study is to analyze how top managers of a local business plant perceive and explain their citizenship relationship to the community of the company town during a transition period from 1976 to 2007. Our study shows that too much reliance on top management cost reduction requirements and not caring, or underscoring, local social concerns created gaps and local stakeholder distrust. We discuss how prolonged distrust of the company to bear social responsibility ended up in a broken relationship between the company and the local community. Our case indicates at least two problems that must be handled for successful corporate citizenship. First, the traditional control-oriented management view is too narrow and not adjusted to today's citizenship reality, including how to handle corporate social responsibility. Second, we can see a possibility where the conceived needs on a global corporate level may lead to situations to obscure local needs and consequences. © 2008 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College.",,

To apply the social contract model properly to the domain of business ethics, it should be: (1) self-disciplined, i.e., not aspire results beyond what the contract model can realistically establish; (2) argumentative, i.e., it should seek to provide principles that are demonstrative results of the contractarian method; (3) task-directed, i.e., it should be clear what the social contract thought-experiment is intended to model; and (4) domain-specific, i.e., the contractarian choice situation should be tailored to the defining problems of business ethics. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Contractarianism; Integrative Social Contracts Theory; Theories of business ethics",

Although substantial empirical research has been conducted on the general topic of researcher interaction biases, none has focused specifically on business ethics research.

My account of Levinas's philosophy will show that it challenges - breaking down - deeply entrenched distinctions in the dominant strands of moral philosophy, within which the theory of individual responsibility is embedded, such as between:(1) duty to others on the one hand and supererogation on the other; (2) perfect duty to others on the one hand and imperfect duties to others on the other; (3) insiders and outsiders; kith and kin on the one hand and strangers on the other; Levinas's moral vision is an inclusive one which embraces all of humanity (at least of those present today) irrespective of historical, linguistic, cultural differences and diversities. In other words, each has responsibilities for and duties towards all others. Of course, one might say that there is nothing new about a universalising ethics - after all Kantianism, liberalism as well as utilitarianism are well known instances. However, more crucially, all these traditional moral philosophies uphold the theory of individual responsibility, which is rooted in the philosophy of individualism. Such a philosophy can make sense only of the concept of individual moral/legal agency but not corporate agency. Therefore, in this article I will attempt to show that the Levinasian vision is able to help us change our view with respect to corporate responsibility. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate responsibility; Face; Justice; Levinas; Saying; Sociality",

Results suggested that business students who received business ethics intervention significantly changed their conceptions of unethical behavior and reduced their propensity to engage in theft; while psychology students without intervention had no such changes. Therefore, ethics training had some impacts on business students' learning and education (intelligence). For our theoretical model, results of the whole sample (N = 298) revealed that Machiavellianism (measured at Time 1) was a mediator of the relationship between the love of money (measured at Time 1) and unethical behavior (measured at Time 2) (the Love of Money → Machiavellianism → Unethical Behavior). Further, this mediating effect existed for business students (n = 198) but not for psychology students (n = 100), for male students (n = 165) but not for female students (n = 133), and for male business students (n = 128) but not for female business students (n = 70). Moreover, when examined alone, the direct effect (the Love of Money → Unethical Behavior) existed for business students but not for psychology students.

What are their attitudes on the responsibilities of business in society? Do the attitudes of women students differ from those of men? What is the influence of business education on these attitudes? Our sample comprised 217 students pursuing a master's degree in business studies at two Finnish universities. The results show that, as a whole, students valued the stakeholder model of the company more than the shareholder model. However, attitudes differed according to gender: women students were more in favor of the stakeholder model and placed more weight on corporate ethical, environmental, and societal responsibilities than their men counterparts - both at the beginning and at the end of their studies. Thus, no gender socialization effect of business school education could be observed in this sense. Business school education was found to shape women and men students' attitudes in two ways. Firstly, valuation of the shareholder model increased and, secondly, the importance of equal-opportunity employment decreased in the course of education. This raises the question whether the educational context is creating an undesirable tendency among future business professionals. The results further suggest that the sociocultural context can make a difference in how corporate social responsibility is perceived.

Animal rights activists are quick to point out the link between the highly efficient factory farms that supply these chains and extreme animal cruelty and environmental degradation. Strategically, fast food is well positioned to leverage change in the methods by which animals are raised and processed for human consumption. Although progress has been made as the fast food industry has responded to pressure exerted by animal rights organizations, there is little indication of true collaborative efforts that would harness the power of the market to bring about substantive changes in the way the consuming public views the issue of animal welfare and food production. © 2008 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College.",,

Morality rejects the idea of choice and the interests of the professional as immoral. Yet the dreadful retaliations against the messengers of the truth make it necessary for morality to leave a way out of whistle-blowing. This is why it forges rights (sometimes called duties) to trump the duty to the public prescribed by professional codes. This serves to hide the obvious fact that whether to blow the whistle is indeed a choice, not a matter of objective duty. One should also notice that if it fails to achieve anything then blowing the whistle was the wrong decision (or maybe the right decision that nobody would want to make). There is nevertheless a tendency to judge it based on the motivation of the whistle blower. In a way, whistle blowers should strive to act like saints. Yet, it is logically impossible to hold both whistle-blowing as mandatory and whistle-blowers as heroes or saints. Moreover, this tends to value the great deeds of a few over the lives of the many, which is incompatible with the basic assumptions of morality. But consistency is not a main feature of professional morality. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Code of ethics; Duty; Engineering ethics; Moral luck; Moral obligation",

Further, we posit that long-run secular trends would be affected through more deliberate, cognitive means, e.g., instruction in business ethics.

However, at one crucial point in his theory, Sacconi introduces the concept of stakeholders' conformist preferences - their disposition to punish the firm if it defects from the agreement, refusing to abide by its own explicit CSR policies and norms. We take issue with him over this concept: we show that the assumption of conformist preferences is a moral premise, and it arguably weakens the normativity of the theory as a whole. As an alternative, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic approach. We draw upon recent applications of evolutionary game theory to moral philosophy (Skyrms, Danielson), and we use a computer simulation of the trust game. According to this approach, the failure of the logic of reputation, which is the problem conformist preferences were introduced to solve, is overcome through the dynamics of interaction. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","CSR; Evolutionary game theory; Lorenzo Sacconi; Social contract theory; Trust game",

The author draws several important conclusions from the empirical analyses. First, CEO incentive pay and poor relative performance increase the likelihood of misrepresentation. Second, misrepresentation impairs subsequent operating performance, although this negative effect can be partially offset by CEO replacement and increased board independence.

This is achieved through systemic smoothing mechanisms such as our socialization against waste, the role of trash cans, and the work of garbage collectors. By exposing the detritus of consumption, the ""waste mountain,"" a macromarketing analysis helps us confront the systemic avoidance of waste.

Results from phone interviews with 187 FFN providers receiving public subsidies indicated that even after controlling for familial status or household income, caregiver perceptions of higher quality care were associated with higher education levels, greater attachment to child care as a job; and lower provider depressive symptoms. After controlling for familial status, data analysed from a subset of 51 mother-provider pairs, indicated that mothers using care from providers who reported higher quality parent-caregiver social relationships reported lower work-family conflict and depressive symptoms.

This paper seeks to provide the criteria for fairly assessing corporate citizenship initiatives as these form an integral part of the changing nature of corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses the Global Compact's 2007 annual review as a point of reference and critical evaluation. The paper refers to the gap found among participants and their inability to answer to the relevant questions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as originally set forth by the UN. Findings - There has been a substantial increase in both scale and impact by this type of private sector initiative: a 50-fold growth in just seven years - unlike any other international collaborative partnership. Based on the assessment, the ongoing question regarding its legitimacy, its operationality and efficiency for improving global governance still remains a challenge at large.

The focus is on the societal and business outcomes of engagement. Design/methodology/approach - The study analyzes 20 business-NGO collaborations of three case companies - Hindustan Unilever, Nokia and Stora Enso. Cases are chosen based on revelatory sampling and data are gathered through documentary research of corporate sustainability reports, project reports and websites. Data analysis focuses on engagement forms, business and societal outcomes of engagement and utilizes a categorization of CR.

The paper will aim to address the following issues: the development of CSR as a voluntary framework based on self-regulation instruments through which corporations can manage their social and environmental impacts; corporations' exercise of power and authority in developing CSR standards globally through inter-firm cooperation; and CSR as a mechanism to transform business culture through the development of co-regulatory instruments between corporations and their stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes the emergence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a new governance framework, essentially created by the pressure of global civil society on corporations. The research focuses on the analysis of new forms of business political activities: self-regulation and co-regulation. Findings - The findings describe how transnational corporations have become private authorities, competing or collaborating with global civil society or public authorities to develop a new framework of social and environmental regulations to manage their responsibilities and exercise their global power. Practical implications - This paper highlights the need for regulatory tools to transform global governance. CSR requires the development of public accountability mechanisms for private authorities, an issue that can be resolved by developing global governance networks between public and private actors.

Taking this as point of departure, it aims to discuss the potential for aligning CSR-oriented industrial self-regulation with public governance to fill some of the governance gap in the global economy. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a conceptual discussion, empirically underpinned by three case studies. Findings - The paper finds that it is plausible, and empirically supported by the case studies, to conceive of a considerable role for CSR based self-regulation in the global economy. A central precondition is the ability of civil society organizations to establish ""moral rights"" as credible voices for ""just causes"" in a media-driven communicative society, and thereby put pressure on brand sensitive industry. The paper finds that corporate self-regulation may fill a larger part of the governance gap if public policy is oriented to engage with industry in a partnered mode. Research limitations/implications - The paper establishes a conceptual base for exploring the governance implications of CSR, casuistically underpinned by three case studies. Further studies are needed, however, to explore the scale and scope of partnered governance in the global economy. Practical implications - The paper provides insights into an approach to increase governability of the global economy.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper starts off by explaining how enterprises transformed from the international corporation model of the nineteenth century, to the multinational corporation model of the twentieth century, to the globally integrated model of the twenty-first century. It argues that, although the multinational model helped to build strong relationships with national governments and country-based NGOs, the model has become redundant and uncompetitive in the globalization era. It shares how moving to the new globally integrated enterprise model is inevitable and raises governance implications at the international, national and local level across many dimensions such as culture, skills and ethics. In fact, the new globally integrated enterprise calls for a redefinition of relationships between an enterprise and its stakeholders and with greater collaboration taking place, the role of trust will become an essential foundation for all issues of governance. Findings - The need for global governance to operate beyond national boundaries is being driven by the combination of a growing global interdependence driven by economics and the rise of transnational challenges such as climate change and poverty.

The aim is to show that such a framework can prepare the ground for a win-win-situation for all stakeholders and for a sustainable combination of interests in profits, human rights, especially the ""right to health"", and human welfare. Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual paper on the basis of step-by-step analytical and interdiscinplinary approach that requires to pick up arguments from economics, business ethics, law, political science as well as aspects of the human rights and the health governance discourse. A broad spectrum of literature and various information sources are referred to: scientific articles and monographs, newspaper and magazine articles, internet sources and information provided by the corporations themselves and by NGOs (non-governmental organizations), as well as recent academic and institutional publications. Desk research is the underlying technique to analyze the sources in a heuristic and interpretative way. For a better understanding, first the complexity of the implementation of ""the right to health"" and the role of different actors will be outlined and second, advantages, positive impacts and deficits of existing health-related CSR (corporate social responsibility) and multistakeholder initiatives by the TNPCs will be pointed out. This is to prepare a ground for arguing in favor of a global governance framework for the TNPCs and to underline the existence of external and internal drivers for the TNPCs to adhere to a global governance framework. Findings - Especially in developing countries the ""right to health"" is poorly implemented. TNPCs could contribute to improvements and partly already do so. Yet, the existing approaches are deficitary, insufficient and not sustainable. The problem calls for more accountability in regard to the access to vital medicines. A global governance frameworks for the TNPCs would pose a win-win-opportunity: While the TNPCs can benefit from more accountability, precisely defined responsibilities as well as efficiency by constructive, strategic partnerships on a stable level-playing-field and a legitimized conduct, their stakeholders benefit from an improved accessibility to vital medicines and an enhanced implementation of the ""right to health"". Originality/value - The paper contributes to the ongoing debate on how to improve the implementation of ""right to health"" by improving the accessibility of vital medicines, especially in developing (and emerging) countries. It proposes new modes of CSR-based conduct and partnerships of the TNPCs and a framework of global governance that are urgently required to tackle with a long-term perspective the problems and threats that pandemics pose on a global scale and to cut down risks for the TNPCs while also widening their markets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Developing countries; Human rights; Medicines; Public health",

It describes a management system to support a strategy, and a governance trail of activities that may be used by Non Executive Directors and Trustees as they discharge their fiduciary responsibilities. Design/methodology/approach - The object is achieved through arguing for a systematic approach to developing ethical behaviour based on core values that support the business strategy. The article then goes on to present examples from organisations from different sectors and sizes where ethical values are part of a positive strategy to determine the culture of the business. Findings - There is clear guidance about how to manage ethical values in business. Readers could start with the ""ethical health check list"" of questions. The questions could be a thought starter to managers discussing the topic at an away day for example. Managers could conduct an audit of an existing ethical strategy to identify if their values statement is being translated into behaviours throughout the organisation. They could contrast their activities with the examples in the article. Originality/value - This article is educational and therefore provides value to senior managers and directors in a concise but comprehensive overview of the topic that is of current concern in the business world. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Governance; Leadership",

This widely used measure focuses on intraorganizational cheating and thus covers only a limited part of the much broader spectrum of unethical behaviors in the workplace. Given the importance of a valid measure, this article uses stakeholder theory as a conceptual basis to develop a broader and multidimensional measure of unethical behavior in eight consecutive steps. Exploratory factor analysis generates five subscales comprising 37 items of unethical behavior primarily related to financiers, customers, employees, suppliers, and society. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrates that a five-factor model has a superior fit to a one-factor model. The subscales display good internal reliability.

Design/methodology/approach - To exemplify this relation, the paper is based on in-depth interviews with a human rights consultant. In this way, the paper presents a story from the field and thus follows a narrative method to retell the story of the consultant leading a human rights project in South Africa. Findings - The paper concludes that following rules is not enough to ensure ethical business in a global market place. As global business rests on dynamics and flexibility, it seems limited that most business ethics rests on bureaucratic notions. The value of also viewing ethical decision-making as personal responsibility is introduced through the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on in depth interviews with one person. Although this method ensures access to deeply personal and thorough knowledge about the event, it also has its limitation and risk of bias. Although this paper points towards some interesting relations between personal responsibility and international/ organisational justice, more research is needed in the field of personal responsibility to make stronger conclusions.

A key challenge in this new competitive environment is navigating through the complex dynamics of customer and stakeholder management from service definition through service delivery (Irons, 1994; Teboul, 2006). Success in this new services environment requires multi-talented individuals. They must be able to develop strong customer relationships and manage complex social networks, while also having a deep understanding of relevant service technologies and processes. These talented individuals are boundary spanners. Boundary spanners link their organizations with the outside world (Russ et al., 1998).

CSR is used as an umbrella term to describe much of what is done in terms of ethics-related activities in firms around the globe to such an extent that some consider it a ""tortured concept"" (Godfrey and Hatch 2007, Journal of Business Ethics 70, 87-98). Addressing this skepticism, I argue in this article that the focus on CSR is indeed problematic for three main reasons: (1) the term carries a lot of historical baggage - baggage that is not necessarily conducive to the clarity of the concept; (2) it is the object of increasing ethical instrumentalism; and (3) given the multiple ethical challenges that corporations face, and given the fact that the ""social"" responsibilities of business are but one set of corporate responsibilities, a suitable term would have to be more inclusive and integrative. I therefore suggests moving instead toward a sound definition of corporate integrity and aim in this article to develop a working definition by fleshing out ""7 Cs"" of integrity: commitment, conduct, content, context, consistency, coherence, and continuity. I then discuss how these 7 Cs impact our understanding of CSR or, more broadly, corporate responsibility in general. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate integrity; Corporate social responsibility; Integrity",

This apparent ambivalence in CSR consequences invites a literature study that can clarify the debate and allow for the drawing of conclusions. The results of the literature study performed here reveal that there is indeed clear empirical evidence for a positive correlation between corporate social and financial performance.

Today business ethics is faced with two challenges. The first comes from the social sciences and consultants who have both reclaimed the topics of business ethics, regretfully often at the loss of the proper ethical perspective. The second comes from the remarkable rise of corporate social responsibility which has pushed aside the mainstream business ethics methodology with its emphasis on moral deliberation by the individual. These challenges can be tackled by an institutional transformation in business ethics that links up to the long-standing European tradition of institutional analysis of the market.

The ethical components of the tourism and hotel industry are important due to the industry's great international importance. The main goal of managers is to generate profits, but only within the legal framework and bearing in mind the rule: 'Never cheat the customer.' Business ethics prescribes profit making, but with respect for ethical principles and standards. Business ethics increases the reputation and market competitiveness of an enterprise.

For this purpose, it embarks on a comparative analysis of the use of the social contract model in two earlier domains: political authority and social justice. Building on this comparison, it then develops four criteria for any future CBE. To apply the social contract model properly to the domain of corporate morality, it should be: (1) self-disciplined, i.e. not aspire to results beyond what the contract model can realistically establish; (2) argumentative, i.e. provide principles that are demonstrative results of the contractarian method; (3) task-directed, i.e. it should be clear what the social contract thought-experiment is intended to model; and (4) domain-specific, i.e. the contractarian choice situation should be tailored to the defining problems of corporate morality. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Contractarianism; Corporate morality; Integrative social contracts theory (ISCT); Kantianism; Practical guidance; Pragmatism; Rights-based theories; Stakeholder theory; Theories of business ethics; Utilitarianism",

The resource-based perspective can thus contribute to the analysis of ethical issues offering important insights on how they can influence the environmental strategy of the firm. The findings of this study show that firm resources have a strong influence on business managers' ethical attitudes. In addition, the application of resource-based rationales to ethical issues can be justified in the following several ways: it influences a managerial perception of natural environment as a competitive opportunity, it requires investments of financial and human resources, flexibility and speed in the adaptation to environmental changes, and it creates new resource-based opportunities through changes in prevention pollution technology, policy process, and market forces. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Environmental strategy; Legitimacy; Resource-based perspective; Social responsibility",

Firstly, the paper reviews literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and especially on the creation of social capital for SMEs. An exploration of Strategic Management Theory follows, focusing on the Positioning and Competence Based Schools, with the objective to find an answer to the question: how do social and environmental issues fit in the logic of creation of competitive advantage and what role do they play during strategic planning? The contributions of Hart (natural resourced based view) and Porter and Kramer (development of strategic intent in social responsible actions) are then related to the framework of possible growth paths of SMEs (Hong and Jeong, 2006, Journal of Enterprise Information Management 19(3), 292-302) in order to answer this question. Strategies that could trigger or lever these growth paths are then discussed.

Results of the PLS structural equation modeling showed that both an attitude and subjective norm favoring corruption led to a desire to act corruptly.

The current paper reports the results of a preliminary study of the ethical climate in local and international CPA firms operating in China, and the influence of ethical climate and personal ethical orientations on decision-making. Contrary to expectations, the perceived ethical climate in local firms was not more negative; however, auditors employed by local firms judged questionable actions as more ethical and indicated a higher likelihood of committing similar actions. Consistent with our hypotheses, perceptions of the ethical climate in one's organization had a significant effect on intentions to commit ethically questionable acts. In addition, high relativists (who tend to reject broad moral principles in favor of situational analysis) were significantly influenced by the perceived organizational ethical climate, but low relativists were not similarly influenced. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It focuses on the narratives provided by Chicago's Chinatown Chinese to justify their involvement in the tourism-related project of manipulating ethnic identity. In so doing, it reveals the role of social relationships and the discursive representations of those relationships, with special attention to the depictions and manipulation of ethnicity as a kind of cultural currency in the tourism exchange. By exposing these relationships, this study reveals intra-ethnic domination processes at work in an ethnic urban space of tourism; processes which, at times, serve to produce experiences of ethnic identity. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper first examines the evolving relationship between business and sustainable development. Second, the sustainability challenge within the regional context in the Asia-Pacific region is outlined. Third, the sustainability challenges posed by China's rise in the global economy are analyzed and the impacts of these challenges on current and future business strategies examined. Findings.- In order to fully understand the strategic convergence between China, business and sustainability concerns, it is important to understand the evolving relationship between business and sustainable development as well as the sustainability challenge within the regional context in the Asia-Pacific region, and assess the impacts of these issues on current and future business strategies in China.

The study uses stakeholder dependency theory and resource dependency theory to explain the content of mission statement. In line with this perspective, stakeholders in this study will be classified as either being resource providers, such as employees and customers, or non-resource providers, such as the community and the environment. The primary aim of the study is to find evidence for the theoretical relationship between the importance of stakeholders to the company and the inclusion of stakeholder groups in the company's mission statement. Design/methodology/approach - The use of a large dataset with 490 observations enables a multivariate analysis of mission statement content, focusing on country-, industry-, and company-specific factors. Findings - The study finds that stakeholder groups the company is more dependent on, are addressed in mission statements more frequently. In addition, the profile of an industry, legal origin and ownership concentration are found to be related with stakeholder inclusion in mission statements. Research limitations/implications - The database used adopts a broad definition of a mission statement, as a result of which the study may also include documents such as vision statements. Additional factors might exist that could explain the inclusion of stakeholder groups in the mission statement. For example, Hope states that both legal origin and culture are important in explaining corporate disclosure. Therefore, literature on cultural dimensions by Hofstede and Schwartz might also be used as explanatory variables in future research. Finally, additional evidence on the industry classification developed in this study is required to further substantiate these results. Practical implications - The observed differences in mission statement content with respect to stakeholder management signify the fact that the mission statement is not a standardized document which can simply be ignored by managers. Therefore, managers must be aware of the environment in which the company is situated, in order to approach the stakeholders which are most important to the organization. A failure to recognize and include essential stakeholders in the mission statement may be costly in the long run, particularly when competitors are better able to address these stakeholders. Originality/value - This study adds to the existing stream of literature on mission statements by introducing the dependence of the company on the stakeholder as an explanatory factor for the inclusion of stakeholders in mission statements. Consequently, the study uses stakeholder dependency theory and resource dependency theory to explain the content of mission statement, rather than signaling theory. Furthermore, this is one of few empirical studies on mission statements that uses a large dataset with 490 observations, enabling a multivariate analysis of mission statement content. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Mission statements; Stakeholder analysis",

The purpose of this paper is to assess the strategies used by listed property trusts (LPTs) in Australia in delivering excellence and international best practice in environmental sustainability for commercial property. Design/methodology/approach - Using content analysis, the annual reports, corporate responsibility and sustainability reports, and carbon disclosure reports for all LPTs in Australia are assessed. These public domain documents are used to identify the corporate strategies used by LPTs for implementing international best practice in environmental sustainability for the LPT commercial property portfolios. Findings - The paper finds that Australian LPTs are seen to be strategically implementing a wide range of procedures regarding environmental sustainability. These contributions represent international best practice in environmental sustainability procedures, and include strategies at the corporate, portfolio and individual commercial property levels. These results confirm the strong leadership role of Australian LPTs in implementing international best practice in environmental sustainability in commercial property. Originality/value - Previous research into sustainable commercial property has largely focused on the valuation implications with sustainability and the various sustainability rating tools. This paper rigorously assesses the strategic issues concerning implementing international best practice in environmentally sustainable commercial property; particularly highlighting the strong leadership role of LPTs in Australia in implementing these international best practices. Given the increasing significance of environmental sustainability and commercial property, this research enables more informed and practical investment decision making by property companies regarding the implementation of environmental sustainability procedures for their commercial property portfolios which are seen to be international best practice.","Benchmarking; Best practice; Corporate social responsibility; Property; Sustainable design; Trusts",

Despite the vast body of research on interorganizational exchange, there has been little effort to address the role of larger social networks in which business-to-business services firms operate.

Internationally there are no successful examples of strategic models used by government, business or civil society to make SRI mainstream by voluntary means. Research indicates that SRI internationally is in single percentage figures only. This is a particularly acute problem if the worst scenarios of climate change (for example) are to be avoided: a rapid shift (within perhaps, eight years) of public and private investment into a SRI framework is required. If the world is to avoid dangerous global warming, it is very unlikely that the strategy of a voluntary shift to an international SRI economy will achieve this, and even with a shift to a regulated economy the chances are not good. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

A connection between doing good and doing well in business is implied. Leading indices, such as the Domini Social Index and others, exemplify the movement toward investing in socially responsible corporations. However, the question remains: Does the ratings-based methodology for assessing corporate social responsibility (CSR) provide an incentive to firms excluded from SRI indices to invest in CSR? Not in its current format. The ratings-based methodology employed by SRI indices in their selection processes excludes many corporations by creating limited-membership lists. This received ratings-based structure is yet to offer an incentive for most of the excluded corporations to invest in improving their levels of CSR. We, therefore, ask under what circumstances a ratings-based method for assessing CSR could provide an incentive to firms excluded from SRI indices to invest in CSR. In this article, we attempt to offer a theoretical reply to this question. We show that when all firms are publicly ranked according to SRI index parameters, such indices can indeed create a market incentive for increased investment by firms in improving their performance in the area of social responsibility. We further show that this incentive tapers off as the amount of investment required exceeds a certain point or if the amount of payback on that investment fails to reach a certain threshold. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Ethical investment; Financial performance; Social responsible investment; Theory of SRI",

The article explains how the institutional economic approach to business ethics analyses morality with regard to an interaction process, and favours non-behavioural, situational intervention with incentive structures and with capital exchange. The article argues that this approach may have to be prioritised over behavioural business ethics, which tends to analyse morality at the level of the individual and favours behavioural intervention with the individual's value, norm and belief system, e.g. through ethical pedagogy, communicative techniques, etc. Quaker ethics is taken as an example of behavioural ethics. The article concludes that through the conceptual grounding of behavioural ethics in the economic approach, theoretical and practical limitations of behavioural ethics, as encountered in a modern context, can be relaxed. Probably only then can behavioural ethics still contribute to raising moral standards in interactions amongst the members (stakeholders) of a single firm, and equally, amongst (the stakeholders of) different firms. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Behavioural approaches to business ethics; Economics & business ethics; Pluralism; Quaker industrialists; Stakeholder theory",

It has aligned broadband developments with furthering information society and knowledge economy developments. This paper presents a positive scenario for broadband-related developments in the European Union area from 2009 to 2012. The scenario, the iNetWorked Society, is one of four developed in an extensive multi-country project funded by the European Commission under the 6th Framework Programme. Before examining the scenario, however, the paper places into a critical perspective the EU's legacy of broadband policy to date. It highlights the limitations of technology-centred policy frames and broadband strategies, which privilege supply-side infrastructure and neglect demand-side issues of applications, uses and users. Such policy frames have been associated with great variations in the level of broadband rollout, take-up and use across Member States. The paper then outlines the socio- and macro-economic conditions that need to be in place in Europe for the positive scenario of the iNetworked Society to be realised. The iNetWorked Society comprises a plausible, internally consistent scenario for developments in a number of broadband-related areas: broadband adoption, e-business, e-work, e-government and digital content.

A practical handbook for business directors who wish to minimise financial, legal and reputational risks. It combines all matters concerning corporate governance with due diligence issues and in doing so provides you with the information and tools you need to help you protect your business when under taking due diligence, particularly when making international acquisitions. The book provides clear guidance and case studies to help all involved understand the complexity of issues and to demonstrate the detailed work that is necessary both to ensure that the benefits of an acquisition can be realised and that there are no unexpected problems, for example through damage to corporate reputation that more that offsets the targeted benefits. As high profile business failures tarnish the reputation of international business it is essential that business responds by having the policies and practices in place in day-to-day operations and in particular, as this book demonstrates, when a major business development such as an acquisition is being implemented. Following the initial era of codes in the UK and regulation in the USA and major debates as regards the best approach to corporate governance in the common law countries, controversy has developed over which approach is really more appropriate for business planning purposes and risk management. Given the trend for many UK companies listed on the US market to de-list in favour of the more British approach to corporate governance and in light of more European corporate scandals this book provides a comparative analysis of the European frameworks for governance. The EU approach and the individual jurisdictions of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and France, in terms of their practical success or failure (with case studies)is covered. With the debate over an EU Constitution and the political stance of Germany (under the Merkel leadership) during its Presidency to revive the Constitution the book assesses the EU approach generally at a time when the competitiveness of companies and key business sectors must consider the thrusting economies of India and China in particular. The link with competitiveness is an increasingly crucial matter. In connection with due diligence, the book provides an update of the business world in light of the worlds economy and links corporate governance, risk management and business planning to reflect such business, political and regulatory trends and changes. In recent years there has been much comment and feedback on the effectiveness of the Sarbanes-Oxley approach to corporate governance and many updates on business ethics and sustainability issues, which this book also covers in the context of due diligence. In addition, since there has been a major shift in business awareness to develop, or be seen to develop, a more enlightened approach to climate change coverage of this area is include in the book in the appropriate context of governance, risk management and business planning, as well as the trends in different parts of the world (USA (and some others v many others!). There are case studies within the book on how business is operating in order to respond to this issue with an international dimension and comparison. The whole debate over being carbon neutral has impacted on the airline industry in particular and has relevance to how industry sectors should balance the interests of the different stakeholders and cope with rather fast attitude changes of the media and public (and the regulators). The importance of energy security has raised key competitiveness issues of major interest and commercial significance. Moreover the angle of fraud in this sector has become more evident. The area of energy security within this book is tied into ethical accounting, fraud, risk etc. and economic crime. These new areas can be set against the background issue of how much of this comes into play with due diligence. How far is this now part of risk management in todays business world. New legislation is covered in terms of developments with the UK Companies Act and Directors? duties with an increasing need to understand reputational concerns and off balance sheet values since the withdrawal of OFR. * The only book that looks at due diligence how its used and how to get it right in the context of Corporate Governance, Reputational Risk Management and Business Planning * A practical guide with case studies and checklists illustrating key business drivers which enable you to monitor risk management effectively * Covers the latest regulatory UK and EU framework for due diligence, and doing business across international boundaries, India, China, USA etc. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The interactions investigated were not restricted to stakeholder relationships but included other communications between different stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a case study approach framed within a contested political arena. Data were gathered using multiple methods including interviews with salmon farming organisations, stakeholders, rule-enforcers, issue amplifiers and political institutions. Findings - All arena participants used social reports in their interactions to communicate the social, environmental and economic consequences of salmon farming. Different social reporting practices appeared to be reflexively related to the competing motivations of different stakeholders. However, social reporting in Scottish salmon farming was fragmented, driven by many different factors and did not necessarily lead to a resolution of the conflicts within this arena. Research limitations/implications - Researching social reporting should consider the co-existence and co-evolution of different social reports, competing motivations and engagement tactics of stakeholders. This paper identifies the construction of holistic reports from multiple reports and issue amplification as two research methods to engage in social and environmental policy debates. Originality/value - This paper presents empirical evidence from an under-researched industry, which has the potential to develop the theoretical understanding of social reporting. It also introduces the arena concept as a useful tool in further social reporting research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fish farming; Reporting; Scotland; Social accounting; Stakeholder analysis",

Themes were observed in multiple research fields, suggesting broad appeal. The authors noted a substantial rise in stakeholder theory's prominence since 1995 and documented that the theory has detractors insofar as it questions shareholders' wealth maximization as the most fundamental objective of business. The authors' recommendations include urging more empirical research across a broader set of organizations apart from large publicly traded corporations, more qualitative research to document cognitive aspects of how managers respond to stakeholder expectations, and a return to the theory's emphasis on the strategic benefits of stakeholder management, albeit with a broader view of firm performance. © 2008 Southern Management Association.

BSR's raison d-être is to attract a corporate membership committed to improving their social performance collectively and individually. It consists of firms from many industrial sectors and addresses a variety of social issues with several mechanisms, including conferences, consulting, newsletters and facilitation of inter-firm cooperation. This distinguishes BSR from most business associations, which tend to focus on improving business competitiveness, political advocacy and public relations. In addition, most forms of corporate self-regulation for social issues typically address a narrow range of issues and industries with specific rather than diverse methods. BSR therefore represents an alternative instrument to both government regulation and voluntary self-regulation. Results show that BSR members tend to perform better in CSP strengths, but that they do not exhibit better performance in areas of CSP weaknesses. Thus, BSR might be an effective instrument for fostering innovative corporate social behavior, helping firms to differentiate themselves based on CSP. On the other hand, our results do not suggest that BSR helps businesses to address the weak aspects of their CSP as an alternative to stronger regulatory approaches.","Business associations; Corporate social performance","Diverse methods; Government regulation; Industrial sector; Social behavior; Social issues; Social performance; Social responsibilities; Public relations; Competition"

This empirical study uses bond market data to assess the relationship, arguing that if CSP is related to CFP it would be over the long-term, and that therefore long-term bonds are a more the suitable security to study rather than stocks. It is further proposed that CSP affects risk, and that it is risk that then affects the firm's financial performance. Thus risk is proposed to be an intermediary between CSP and CFP. Mediated regression is therefore used to assess the relationship between CSP (as measured by KLD) and CFP (as measured by the yield-to-maturity, YTM, on bonds). Risk is measured by the Moody's risk rating on a firm's long-term bonds, because it is a forward-looking measure and a long-term measure, and is therefore an appropriate measure of long-term future risk. Regression results show that the Moody's risk rating does fully mediate the relationship between KLD and YTM.

By adopting the operational strictures of economy, efficiency and performance, many universities are behaving like and being run as though they were a business. The term 'corporate university' now carries much meaning and has been the subject of significant discourse over the last decade. Resource limitations, political influences and competitive pressures are commonplace with implications for the way in which a university can fulfil a role in society, however that is defined. In this paper we consider the notion of corporate citizenship and ask whether this concept is relevant to the role of a university in Australia and New Zealand. In these countries universities are substantially (although progressively less so) funded by the government and are public service entities. The application of corporate citizenship to universities serves to highlight the duality of these institutions, which operate like corporations, and yet have more obvious historically based obligations to society. The comparison also suggests that as corporations are becoming more aware of the long-term benefits of a societal role for business entities that universities appear to be moving in the opposite direction. With a few exceptions academics have been reluctant to engage in public debates. They have progressively lost control of their working environment. The risk is that the public interest will have no place in the corporatised university of the 21st century unless academics increase their critic and conscience activities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The need for a change in corporates' approach towards stakeholder management is greater now than ever before. Though the term 'stakeholder' was first used in the West in the 1930s, this concept has been highlighted in the ancient Indian scriptures written centuries ago. These highlight the methodologies the kings used to ensure the welfare of all their stakeholders. The kings of yore, who considered themselves as trustees of their kingdom, can be compared to the top management in corporates of this era. Thus, the concepts highlighted in these ancient scriptures find as much relevance and applicability even in today's times. This article takes a brief look at few of the studies undertaken in this area and also highlights excerpts from the ancient Indian scriptures to prove that the concept of stakeholder management owes its origin to India.",,

In this study, the authors investigate the relationship between mission statement content and stakeholder management actions. Findings indicate that although social issues such as the environment and diversity are less frequently included, their mention in mission statements is significantly associated with behaviors regarding these issues. The study found no relationship between firms with mission statements that mention specific stakeholder groups (employees, customers, and community) and behaviors regarding these stakeholders. This suggests that the inclusion of specific stakeholder groups in missions is likely the result of institutional pressures, while specifying social issues in missions is related to policy decisions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Diversity; Environment; Mission statement; Social issues; Stakeholder management",

Yet, paradoxically, the cornerstone of this phenomenon, economic performance, varies widely across the world whatever indicator (for example, GDP/habitant, competitiveness) we choose to use to compare countries. Increasingly, studies tend to explain this apparently paradoxical situation with reference to the issue of corruption and ethics. In essence, corruption is perceived to be an important impediment to the economic development of a country (or area). Many studies of corruption are focused at the national level. The aim of this conceptual paper is to explore the role of the firm (as opposed to national states or international institutions) as an influence on national corruption. We call for firms to reconsider their behavior regarding corruption, particularly in relation to their relationships with their stakeholders. We argue that by focusing on issues such as cooperation and stakeholder theory, a firm will change the way it does businesses by reducing private-to-public as well as private-to-private corruption and incorporating business ethics into its management strategies.","Cooperation; Corruption; Ethics; Globalization; Stakeholder theory; Strategic management",

One of the effects that has been the development of a strong emphasis upon questions of moral motivation within the field. Often in business ethics, there is no real dispute about the content of our moral obligations, the question is rather how to motivate people to respect them. This is a question that has been studied quite extensively by criminologists as well, yet their research has had little impact on the reflections of business ethicists. In this article, I attempt to show how a criminological perspective can help to illuminate some traditional questions in business ethics. I begin by explaining why criminologists reject three of the most popular folk theories of criminal motivation. I go on to discuss a more satisfactory theory, involving the so-called ""techniques of neutralization,"" and its implications for business ethics. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Character; Deviance; Moral motivation; Techniques of neutralization; White-collar crime",

In business, moral luck commonly influences our moral judgments, many of which have economic consequences that cannot be reversed. The possibility that the chance intervention of luck could influence the way in which we assign moral accountability in business ethics is unsettling. This paper argues that if we cannot explain moral luck away, we should give consideration to moral risk in our moral judgments and the associated assignment of economic rewards regarding episodes in which moral luck plays a role. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Executive compensation; Gauguin; Luck; Moral hazard; Risk; River blindness",

Using an in-depth case study approach, this model is then applied to one firm - Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). Developing an understanding of the figurative black box of SAS's motivations contributes to unlocking the reasons why corporations are choosing (or not) to commit to CSER. If these reasons are known, they can be used to develop appropriate mechanisms to ensure that CSER is an important aspect of a company's decision-making regime. Findings of the case study provide further evidence that motivations cannot be looked at in isolation of sectoral and cultural contexts. Secondly, it was seen how catalysts - the lens through which a firm sees and interprets motivations - can have an important impact in its level of commitment to CSER. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

He believes that social responsibility advocates are wasting resources and efforts on a doomed project. This article suggests that while Reich raises several interesting concerns in his counter-intuitive book, especially about the rise in corporate political power, ultimately his argument is unconvincing. Worse yet, a careful reading suggests that Reich does not contemplate fully what it is he is asking business and society to give up in his call to jettison corporate social responsibility.

It is a vehicle for promoting transparency, more nuanced accountability, integrity, better communication, mutually beneficial exchange, and sensible development. In providing a language and vocabulary to critique business from both inside and outside its boundaries, it has becomes a necessary condition for business ethics and modern capitalism. It is especially important in a world of increasing global economics. Nevertheless, it is an extremely fragile asset.

It goes on to identify the nature of the ecological citizenship concept and the three different understandings that are prevalent in the literature. Applying these perspectives to corporations, it then establishes how ecological citizenship can help us to examine corporate responsibilities for exporting liberal citizenship, rethink the stakeholder set, and reconfigure the community of the corporation. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Business and the natural environment; Citizenship studies; Corporate environmentalism; Ecological footprint analysis; Environmental policy; Management theory; Stakeholder theory","citizenship; ecological footprint; environmental policy; environmental politics; environmentalism; stakeholder; theoretical study"

The law was passed in response to the horrendous corporate disasters that had occurred, including Enron, Worldcom, Adelphia, and Tyco. The implementation of effective business ethics became essential and the new law required the publication of corporate codes of ethics. It did not mandate their content. This paper suggests specific sections for inclusion in the general guidelines to encompass the ethical dimensions of the Act. It analyzes the compliance by the corporations in their public filings since Sarbanes-Oxley became law. The revelation of the size of the audit and accounting fees paid to Arthur Andersen by Enron and similar fees paid in other current financial debacles lead to another key requirement of Sarbanes-Oxley: mandatory auditor rotation. Here, however, Sarbanes-Oxley did not go far enough. The law required rotation only of the lead auditor within a firm. This paper submits that it should have required rotation of audit firms instead. The positions of the public companies, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Government Accountability Office, and accounting journals are explored as to the rotation of auditor firms regarding audit-partner rotation within a firm. The paper concludes that Sarbanes-Oxley should be expanded to require audit-firm rotation. This expansion is necessary to reinforce the independence of the public accountant, both in fact and appearance, and to restore competition within the accounting profession, which will benefit the investing public. It is up to the Security and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, ultimately, Congress to make this expansion a reality.","Accounting; Arthur andersen; Audit-firm rotation; Auditing; Auditor rotation; Codes of ethics; Corporate governance; Enron; Ethics education; Sarbanes-Oxley",

The social assessment framework put forward is based on TNS stakeholder management model, TRI*M, and focuses on the critical area of how aid and donor organizations can assess the effectiveness of social development programs. The Millennium Development Goals have opened up a two way street between donors and beneficiaries and has provided for a need to look at social development assessment from a new perspective. The reader is taken through a journey of how the model came about, challenges faced during the process, and a vision for how the model will be used in the future. The two basic components of the model, the Program Effectiveness Index and the TRI *M Grid for understanding program drivers, are explained. A case study covering the Tsunami relief effort in Aceh, where the model was used for the first time, is included as an example of how TNS was able to deliver insight and clear direction in an otherwise complex environment. A client perspective is also provided both in terms of needs assessment and actions taken by UNICEF as a result. The chapter concludes with a reflection of what the future holds and the opportunity to apply the framework in other countries as well as for different situations. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,

Human rights organizations justify rights by appealing to human dignity. Prominent politicians have cited the need to protect human dignity and urged the founding of international institutions. The concept of human dignity is often used to evaluate and critique the ethics of select practices. In addition, the idea of dignity is used as a universal principle to ground universalist business ethics. This paper argues that there are substantial differences between the ways in which the West and China construe human dignity. Having documented these major differences, we consider two cases to show how the differences might ""cash out"" in actual business practice. Instead of relying upon a nonexistent universal concept of human dignity, we suggest that it is respectful and sound to seek to identify the many goods (teamwork, initiative, autonomy, respect for elders) that differing parties see at play in the case at hand and then to try to come up with ways to realize as many of these goods as possible. © 2008 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College.",,

The three underlying assumptions of conscientious capitalism are: (1) interconnectedness between individuals, businesses, and global society; (2) wealth as a holistically understood state rather than solely a financial status; and (3) relevant time spanning multiple generations.

Interviews with business and finance executives at 11 colleges reveal the importance to governance change of chief executive and board member leadership and interactions, as well as executive communication style. Costs are clear constraints to action, particularly since benefits are not quantified and are difficult to describe. Efforts to discuss governance with internal stakeholders require persistence to overcome narrow, individualized concerns. Communication about governance to external stakeholders is rare and represents a missed opportunity for stakeholder feedback and the development of trust. Executives appear willing to adopt governance forms without considering the idiosyncrasies of their institutional field, limiting the working definition of governance and its potential. For corporations and not-for-profit enterprises these findings hold implications for the context in which leadership is exercised and the shape of governance structures.

As I argue, such assumptions serve to narrow the scope of business ethics in the examination of technology. To reinforce the practical implications of these assumptions and to further illustrated the current arguments, I leverage the recent dialog around U.S. Internet technologies in China. The goal of this article is to broaden that which is morally salient and relevant to business managers and business ethicists in the analysis of technology by highlighting key lessons from seminal STS scholars.

Gardner, best known for his seminal work on multiple intelligences, grounds his major conclusions primarily on the results of his impressive, decade-long, and massive Good Works Project. Despite my several agreements and significant overlap with Howard Gardner, I believe that there is insufficient evidence to accept fully his policy prescriptions. Gardner's selection of the five minds of the future - the disciplined, synthesizing, creating, respectful, and ethical minds - is based on a set of limiting assumptions concerning globalization, good work, individuality, power and control, disciplines as value-free enterprises, ethics as the point of view of the universe, and the completeness of his list. This paper suggests that our conception of education might be dramatically expanded to include a more critical and distanced stance towards: globalization, the current goals of business, individualism, the traditional disciplines, and even ethics than Gardner currently imagines. Its aims can and should be broadened to include not only good work, but also love and play. Students must learn how to control their environments, but also how to appreciate and accept life's inevitable difficulties and limits. Ethics should certainly play a more central role in education as Gardner correctly emphasizes, but our understanding of ethics must include not only respect but also care; not only principles but also dialog. To accomplish all of this, however, requires us to think beyond Gardner's five minds to include additional ""mental dispositions"" like the caring, critical, intersubjective, spiritual, and joyful minds. Each of these ""minds"" is explored in this paper. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Howard Gardner; Spirituality; Teaching business ethics",

But the experience shows that the ways of achieving the purposes or even the purposes themselves are not always ethical, do not always satisfy the true values of society. Cultural, historical, experience differences between countries determine different understanding and development of values. Although ethical questions are topical in all countries, as a bigger problem it remains in the transitional countries, in which the worth and the traditions of using them in every day and business situations are still in process. Although Lithuania already exited from the status of transitional country in economic and political senses, it will stay for a while in this status because of transitioning in values Marketing ethics is rather widely researched in world dimension. The most salient researches in marketing ethics are Th. W. Dunfee, N.C. Smith, W. T. Ross (1999), O. C. Ferrel (2001, 2002), Ph. Kotler (1993, 1999), G R. Laczniak (1990, 1993), F. W. Landgrehr (1994), E. J. McCarthy (1993),E. J. McCarthy and W. D. Perreault (1990), P. E. Murphy and G R. Laczniak (1992), J. Nantel and A. W. Weeks (1996), B. B.Schlegelmich (1998, 2001), D. B. Tinsley (2003), and others. Business, marketing ethics were researched by Lithuanian authors as well. A conception of social ethical marketing in a view of ecology was examined by V. Tamuliene (2002), V. Liesionis (2006). Business ethics like phenomenon existing between Lithuanian businessmen was researched by A. Paulaviciute (2004). Problematics of business and marketing ethics also was researched by N. Vasiljeviene (2000), G Berzinskas (2002), V. Pruskus (1997, 1998, 2003), D. Vysniauskiene and V. Kundrotas (1999), R. Freitakiene (2001) and others. Although researches in marketing, business ethics both in Lithuania and abroad are comparing numerous, situation in practice of marketing ethics essentially is not getting better. The researches of some authors show that a lot of people still muddle the concepts of ethics and ethiquette, don't realize what ethical norms should be followed, why should be followed (Paulaviciute, 2004). It is noticed; that the decisions made in the various situations differ, as far as ethics is concerned. Having analyzed these situations, it is possible to distinguish recurrent regularity, which is summarized by the authors and submitted as determinant factors of decision making process. Analysis of factors influencing ethics of marketing decisions can help to find out how to encourage ethical decisions in researched business sector. The authors rather widely give different approaches how different factors influence ethicalness of a decision taking process. They give different schemes, models. But authors do not compare factors influencing ethicalness of marketing and conditions when these factors operate. This does not give a full view and determines slower integration of marketing ethical rules to every day life of any business sector, in which following of ethical rules would become matter-of-course.","Individual factors; Marketing ethics; Media; Organisational factors",

There are a variety of ethical concerns dealing with bullying-that is, courses of action to manage the bullying contain serious ethical/legal concerns. The inadequacies of legal protections for bullying in the U.S. workplace also compound the approaches available to deal ethically with bullying. While Schumann (2001, Human Resource Management Review 11, 93-111) does not explicitly examine bullying, the five moral principles that he advocates can be applied to judge the ethics of bullying in the workplace. A possible limitation of this model is that, it is designed to be normative (judgmental), and while it does take into consideration the relationships among the victim, the perpetrator, the groups in the organization, and the organization itself in judging the ethics of bullying, it does not explicitly consider the process by which bullying might develop and persist. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of this process, Nijhof and Rietdijk (1999, Journal of Business Ethics 20(1), 39-50)) suggest applying an A-B-C (antecedents, behaviors, and consequences) model to help understand the dynamics of bullying in the workplace.

The paper aims to find how these mission-oriented entrepreneurs achieve their business objectives while serving their social and environmental causes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper identifies 21 successful sustainable entrepreneurial companies in various industries ranging from apparel to biotechnology that were exemplary in their pursuit for sustainability. The paper examined their key decisions and activities in their ""entrepreneurial process"", collecting most of the relevant information from published or self-developed case studies. Findings: The paper finds that most of sustainable entrepreneurs are an unusual breed with limited business backgrounds. Most obtain financing from non-conventional sources and employ unorthodox, yet sound human resource management practices. They are shrewd in their marketing strategies and effective in running efficient, environmentally sound operations. Also, they find innovative methods for balancing their financial goals against their objectives of making a difference in their environment and society. Practical implications: The paper's findings help demystify and provide some insights into how values-oriented entrepreneurs and their companies can simultaneously meet economic, social and/or environmental objectives. Originality/value: This paper is one of the few studies that examine the business practices of for-profit, sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs. It is also one of the few formal studies that identify commonalities among a relatively large and diverse sample of companies.

In scientific literature are not dealt with the indicators of university's effectiveness. That is why university's effectiveness can be evaluated quite subjectively. The absence of universally accepted indicators of university effectiveness creates assumptions to differently interpret results, which distorts objective view of university effectiveness in the market.

Some organizations now aim to integrate values into their business practices, which requires a thorough understanding of the organizational values. However, while many believe organizational values should reflect the collective values of the staff, the majority of values statements are generated by senior management with little examination of employees' personal values. The difficulties surrounding the development of an organization's values are exacerbated by the dearth of literature offering practical guidance. The case study presented has been conducted in a UK construction company using Schwartz's theoretical framework of human values as a starting point and framing device. Employees' values profiles were collected and analysed through an organizational-wide values survey. Follow-up workshops and post-workshop activities facilitated the sharing of common values and helped staff representatives develop their own organizational values statements, independent of the senior management, before a final stage of negotiation with them. The findings support the argument that the shaping of collective organizational values should be based on a clear understanding and communication of employees' personal values, and Schwartz's circumplex model of values and associated survey instrument are helpful framing devices to initiate and structure such a debate. Compared to the usual management-imposed approach, this bottom-up process could make organizational values explicit in a more understandable and useful way, and improve values congruence between individuals and host organizations.","Case study; Management; Organizational values; Personal values; Values statements","Construction industry; Surveys; Technical presentations; Bottom-up; Business ethics; Business practices; Case study; Human values; Organizational theories; Organizational values; Personal values; Practical guidances; Senior managements; Survey instruments; Uk constructions; Values statements; Personnel; construction industry; management; negotiation process; organizational framework; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe"

Using the ""Granger causality"" approach, we find no significant relationship between a composite measure of a firm's CSP and FP, except for market returns.

Both sides of this argument - that good ethics is good business and that bad ethics is bad business - are explored. The possibility of a moral floor above which ethical behavior is not rewarded is considered, and an economic experiment testing such a proposition is discussed. Johnson & Johnson suffers a potentially devastating blow when some cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules cause several deaths. Johnson & Johnson voluntarily pulls Tylenol off the shelf, to universal acclaim. When Tylenol is returned to the marketplace, its share of the over-the-counter painkiller market becomes greater than it was before the tragedy. Arthur Andersen, the venerable accounting firm, is caught in the web surrounding the downfall of Enron, Inc. As Enron's various sins are discovered, it is found that Arthur Andersen auditors had signed off on flawed audits and had shredded documents to cover themselves. Andersen is prosecuted for, and convicted of, obstructing justice (although the conviction is later overturned). Today the firm barely exists and has no resemblance to the Big Five accounting giant of 1999. These stories seem to indicate that ethical (or unethical) behavior leads to positive (or negative) financial results. But the philosophical arguments underpinning such statements are seldom subjected to proper analysis. They are perhaps wishful thinking, or perhaps based on examples such as the above without considering other examples that may reinforce a contrary position. This paper will explore the philosophical arguments and empirical evidence regarding these statements and state some research questions for exploration in this area. In particular we will propose the possibility that a moral floor exists above which firms that engage in ethical activities will not reap rewards, but below which firms that engage in unethical activities will be punished by actors in the economic marketplace. We will discuss an economic experiment to determine if such actors indeed form a moral floor. © Springer 2009.","Corporate financial performance; Corporate social performance; Ethical behavior",

Whilst markets are increasingly willing to reward good and responsible firms, they lack the instruments to measure corporate social performance (CSP). To convince investors and other stakeholders, firms invest heavily in building a reputation for good corporate behaviour. This article argues that reputations for CSP are often unrepresentative of true CSP and investigates how differences in 'perceived' and 'actual' - as measured by the Fortune and KLD databases, respectively - can partly be explained by firm characteristics. Amongst other things, it finds that overrated firms are more likely to be relatively big, profitable, operating in non-polluting but competitive industries and with no history of wrong doings to their primary stakeholders. They will also typically spend a lot of effort satisfying the claims of their secondary stakeholders.

Stakeholder management has become an important tool to transfer ethics to management practice and strategy. Nevertheless, legitimate criticism continues to insist on clarification and emphasises on the perfectible nature of the model. Here, rather than building on the discussion from a philosophical or theoretical point of view, a different and innovative approach has been chosen: the analysis will return to the origin of stakeholder theory and will keep the graphical framework firmly in perspective. It will confront the stakeholder model's graphical representation to the discussion on stakeholder definition, stakeholder identification and categorisation, to re-centre the debate to the strategic origin of the stakeholder model. The ambiguity and the vagueness of the stakeholder concept are discussed from managerial and legal approaches. The impacts of two major shortcomings of the popular stakeholder framework are examined: the boundaries and the level of the firm's environment, and the ambivalent position of pressure groups and regulators. Working pragmatically, with a focus on the managerial and organisational perspective, an attempt is made to clarify the categorisations and classifications by introducing new terminology with a distinction between stakeholders, stakewatchers and stakekeepers. The analysis will finally lead to a proposed upgraded and refined version of the stakeholder model, with incremental ameliorations close to Freeman's original model and a return of focus to its essence, the managerial implications in a strategic approach. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Freeman's model; Graphical framework; Pressure groups; Stakeholder; Stakeholder model; Stakeholder theory; Stakekeeper; Stakewatcher; Strategy",

In order to make room for more humane business practices, however, a new kind of business ethics is requisite: one that does not subordinate its principles to the narrow confines of short-term profit maximization. Since discussion in business ethics is often influenced and framed by the theoretical foundations of academic economics, the demand for a new business ethics translates into the need for a critique of the economic paradigms underlying traditional business ethics. In that vein, a departure from certain reductionistic economic theories, namely from basic assumptions of neoclassical economics, becomes crucial. Instead of construing human agency within a matrix of self-centered utility calculations, the real human being needs to be reintroduced into economic theory, and we must recognize the eminent role of human freedom. In pursuit of a humanistic business ethics, an economic philosophy based upon the notion of human freedom must be advanced. With astounding speed, the global exchange of products and services is transforming the natural and cultural face of the earth. Biological systems vanish, customary rules of behavior fade, legal frameworks dissolve, languages die out, and many traditional religions are on the wane. In their stead, driven by an exponential increase in information exchange, novel forms of interaction are taking hold; various new ways of life are quickly spreading, from their origins in the remotest localities on earth and even from cyberspace, all around the globe. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,

Design/methodology/approach: A structured survey was designed and administered to a sample of Lebanese respondents to test the extent of ethical sensitivity of the respondents. This study used a range of situations and scenarios to identify the levels of both sensitivity to business ethics and awareness of unethical business. Findings: Significant differences were found in ethical sensitivity in only four out of 18 situations where in all cases females were more sensitive than males to issues of ethical nature. When comparing younger to older employees, significant differences were found in six out of the 18 situations. Age of the respondents seemed to better explain some ethical differences among respondents in some situations. Research limitations/implications: The specific context (workers) in which this study was conducted may limit the generalizability of the results. In addition, such studies measure perceptions of business ethics or intentions to act in an ethical or unethical way. This does not necessarily describe the actual behavior that people will be involved in. Practical implications: The findings suggest that males and females ethical orientations tend to get closer to each other as they mature in age. This could be due to workplace socialization. Accordingly, managers are invited to see the impact of workplace culture on ethical beliefs and behaviors.

Preamble, Universal Declaration of Human Rights Accepting a conceptual challenge The debate on “business and human rights” has become a central theme on the international corporate responsibility agenda. Two processes in particular have contributed to this: the discourse on the practical consequences of the two UN Global Compact principles that are specific to human rights and the work of a sub-commission of the Human Rights Commission under the chairmanship of American law professor David Weissbrodt. The result of this work, a set of “Draft Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises,” was considered to contain “useful elements and ideas” but was not accepted by the Human Rights Commission as a document with legal standing. One factor that evoked concern and disapproval for some observers was a generally negative undertone regarding the impact of corporate activities on human rights as well as impractical monitoring and verification mechanisms “already in existence or to be created”. To overcome the deadlock that evolved from incompatible positions of different stakeholders vis à vis the draft norms, on April 20, 2005, the UN Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution on “Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Businesses,” which requested the secretary-general to appoint a “Special Representative on the Issue of Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Businesses. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,

An example of the information that could be derived from such a network is the average distance between performers who belong to part of business process that is already modeled and the ones who belong to a candidate process. A user can apply this result to complete a process model in a way that is similar to earlier selected solutions. The social network from recommendation history shows the relationship among modelers who use the recommendation system.

Ten valuable eco-efficiency management tools were highlighted, that can help business and industry to maximise efficiency, product quality and profit through improved environmental management. In the last months the green world market loses money, and companies cut off investments for alternative energy. Intentions to invest on long term in green economy are postponed. Investment funds are still attracted by the green solutions. There is not a crash, but a fall.

Respondents all over the world, but especially in Europe and the Americas, worry about safety and they don't trust current business leaders to ensure a prosperous world for the next generation. Obviously, even a few years after the corporate scandals in the United States and elsewhere, business leaders still face a significant lack of trust in the wider public. Not surprisingly, then, we find an exponential increase in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and reporting over the past years through which businesses want to show that they act responsibly, are good corporate citizens, and contribute to the well-being of societies in which they operate. “Re-building public trust” is arguably a priority for business leaders at home and abroad, and corporate responsibility among their core challenges. In fact, there is widespread agreement that it takes responsible leadership to build and sustain a business in society.

The approach holds that human beings are fundamentally free and have a sense of human dignity. Therefore, institutions need to help people enhance this dignity by providing them with the opportunity to develop their capabilities freely. I argue that this approach may help support business ethics based on virtue. Since teleology has become problematic, virtue ethics has had difficulty giving itself an ultimate justification. By combining virtue ethics with the capabilities approach, it becomes possible to ground virtue ethics on the basis of the existence of human dignity. This frees virtue ethics of the need for a strict teleology, replacing it with the notion that people must work to develop the capabilities of others although those capabilities are not pointed toward a definite goal. I further suggest that by grounding virtue ethics in capabilities, the actions of a virtuous manager become clearer. Rather than simply charging a manager with serving the public, the manager is charged with serving the stakeholders in a way that develops their capabilities. For example, a manager should not just give their employees what is just but must give them the environment and the encouragement to grow and to find fulfillment in their job. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Capabilities approach; Nussbaum; Sen; Solomon; Virtue ethics",

Using numerous real-world examples, he argues that business leaders have good reason to take character seriously when explaining and evaluating individuals in organisations. He demonstrates how the virtue approach can deepen our understanding of business ethics, and how it can contribute to contemporary discussions of character, rationality, corporate culture, ethics education and global ethics.

It is argued that these changes are shifting the corporate role towards a sphere of societal governance hitherto dominated by traditional political actors. This leads to a discussion of the ambivalent results of such a process for a responsible corporate role in a globalized world.

Nearly all important indicators and measurements of profit and efficiency were linked to the performance of the firm and the traditional business worldview strongly emphasises competitive power. There is little mention of the flip side of the coin, which is cooperative power. the purpose of this paper is to improve business performance in projects by understanding the concept 'cooperative power' and what conditions influence projects organisational problems.

The observed inconsistency between the role and rule of business, being detrimental to the society has raised a concern about implementing business governance that would integrate value framework, ethical framework and moral framework under which business decisions are taken. To comply with the moral standards for optimizing the outcome for directly negotiating parties the corporate need to adopt a dual goal concept: a strategic goal and moral goal.

Design/methodology/approach: Respondents were instructed to assume that an Ethical Practices Code had been drawn up by firms operating in the industry in which they intended to work and were asked to indicate their levels of disagreement/agreement with seven statements relating to the possible consequences of such a code. Tests of significance were used to analyze responses for the USA and Chinese groups. In addition, the effect on responses of a course in ethics was examined. Findings: Despite the recent attention focused on corporate irresponsibility and the possible adverse effects on US consumers of outsourcing to China, the findings indicate that, with one exception, attitudes toward codes of ethics were not significantly different between the Chinese and USA respondents.

The article examines the contents of the codes of ethics of companies operating in the private sector in Italy, quoted on the Italian Stock Exchange (Standard&Poor/Mib-Milano Indice Borsa). The purpose of this investigation was to identify any correlations between sector characteristics and the contents of the codes of ethics, which would enable us to map out the main principles followed in writing the companies' codes of ethics. The analysis was conducted in order to ascertain whether there were common factors deriving from the shared ethical questions faced by the companies operating in the same sector of activity. As the first step, the 40 companies were subdivided into three main economic categories - Industrial, Financial and Service. Then the contents of each code of ethics were evaluated and classified in accordance with different criteria. The main categories of classification were based on - general principles, social values, rules of conduct, relationships with third parties, implementation and sanctions. The next objective was to investigate whether these characteristics were due to the regulation of the sector of reference, the existence of sector benchmarks for best practice, or simply companies' voluntary stance on ethical issues. The main conclusions were that the codes of ethics of the Italian companies that we analysed do not seem to show relevant differences traceable to sector of activity, and their adoption is affected by several reasons other than intentionally ethical considerations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Code of ethics; Content analysis; Corporate social responsibility; Italian quoted companies",

I focus on the duties executives themselves have with respect to their own compensation. I argue that CEOs' fiduciary duties place a moral limit on how much compensation they can accept, and hence seek in negotiation, from their firms.

We qualify this process by proposing conditions more ripe for anomie and under which this deinstitutionalization is more likely to occur, propounding moderating relationships that influence organizational reconfiguration.

Second, organizational justice researchers have investigated one set of individual differences, behavioral researchers have examined another.

These decisions are made more common by the changing norms of a pluralistic business environment, and require collective moral deliberation to be adequately resolved. Discourse ethics ideally characterizes the form of valid collective moral deliberation. I argue that accommodation for the limitations of actual discourse makes discourse ethics, conceived in terms of the rules of practical discourse, practical for realizing improvements in the openness and validity of moral decision-making over states in which these rules are flagrantly violated. These rules have normative implications at the organizational level for the integrity approach to corporate ethics programs, and at the individual level for ethical leadership. ©2009 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

In this article we review and discuss research that informs the morality of influencing and regulating the emotions of others. What are the moral limits of the use of emotion as a management tool for shaping workplace behavior and influencing the thoughts and actions of consumers? Do the ethics of emotional labor and emotional appeals (e.g., in consumer advertising) depart from moral rules that apply in &quot;non-emotional&quot; contexts? To explore these questions we examine research on the means by which individuals' emotions are shaped and on the organizationally relevant consequences of individual emotional experience. We then discuss a number of potential ethical issues that are implicit or explicit in the organizationally sanctioned use of emotion management, incorporating existing literature in management and business ethics that has addressed the moral obligations of organizations in this context, and highlighting areas where there is yet work to be done.

These characteristics reflect a model for degree curriculum concerned with organizational process in general, as well as an institutional culture favourable to critical perspectives on the subject matter. The emphasis on generic processes would distinguish this curriculum from those that focus more on functional area of business organizations.The paper considers these contrasting models for curriculum design, the question of module evaluation, the institutional context, the rational and content of the ethics modules and their relationship to other elements of the degree programme.

This paper seeks to propose that the management theory of Peter F. Drucker and certain Aristotelian concepts, expressed in the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics, are applicable to the business community today. Design/methodology/approach: Drucker's management philosophy is synthesized with the moral philosophy of Aristotle to suggest a practical management framework for contemporary business practitioners. In providing a virtue-based moral framework for management grounded in a concern for character, communal wellbeing, and ultimate purpose, Drucker's Aristotelian-style of business management provides a viable, virtue-based management theory that contemporary managers should be able to embrace. Findings: Drucker has been regarded as one of the most influential management thinkers of the twentieth century. It is suggested that, given the current level of morality shown in the behaviour of business people today - business leaders in particular, what is needed is a change in managerial perspective. A change from the prevailing concern with one's own wellbeing - how much one has, or can get for oneself - to include a concern for the wellbeing of others. It is proposed that Drucker's management philosophy, which reflects Aristotelian matters of character, community and telos, though formulated many years ago, provides a framework for improving managerial behaviour today. Research limitations/implications: Drucker's pragmatic business commentary and advice reveal a deep understanding of the complexity of the business world and the realities of business from the perspective of the business person, and yet do not reject the overriding moral principles of integrity, community and achievement that serve as the foundation for society. Originality/value: The paper offers a business-relevant, virtue-based perspective that, in the author's opinion, is more than adequate for a renewed vision of management in the twenty-first century. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Leadership; Philosophical concepts; Social responsibility; United States of America",

Advances in technology, increasing globalization, heightened competition, shifting demographics – these have all been documented and written about extensively. Far less notice has been given to another, more subtle, change – one that is just as remarkable as these more visible developments. What I have in mind is the attention being paid to values in many companies today. When I began doing research and teaching about business ethics in the early 1980s, skepticism about this subject was pervasive. The whole enterprise, said critics, was misguided and based on a naive view of the business world. Back then, accepted wisdom held that “business ethics” was a contradiction in terms. The most generous view was that business ethics had something to do with corporate philanthropy, a topic that might interest executives after their companies became financially successful. But even then, it was only a frill – an indulgence for the wealthy or eccentric. Today, attitudes are different. Though far from universally embraced – witness the scandals of 2001 and 2002 – ethics is increasingly viewed as an important corporate concern. What is our purpose? What do we believe in? What principles should guide our behavior? What do we owe one another and the people we deal with – our employees, our customers, our investors, our communities? Such questions of ethics are being taken seriously in many companies around the world. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,

However, recent insights have shown that the empirical branch of business ethics lacks thorough theoretical grounding. This article discusses the use of the Rawlsian methods of wide reflective equilibrium and overlapping consensus in the field of applied ethics. Instead of focussing on one single comprehensive ethical doctrine to provide adequate guidance for resolving moral dilemmas, these Rawlsian methods seek to find a balance between considered judgments and intuitions concerning particular cases on the one hand and general principles and theories on the other. In business ethics this approach is promising because it enables decision-making in a pluralist context with different stakeholders who often endorse different or even conflicting cultural and moral frameworks without giving priority to any of them. Moreover, the method is well founded in political theory. A taxonomy of different kinds of applications is developed, and classified according to the purpose, the content, and the type of justification. On the basis of this taxonomy an inventory of 12 recent applications is made. In terms of the purpose and content of the method the applications are rather diverse. Two conceptual obstacles for applying Rawlsian methods are identified, viz. inclusiveness and the communitarian objection that people have to become detached from their personal life. It is found that methodological questions, such as the question how to retrieve the relevant empirical data, are scarcely addressed in the literature. To advance the use of empirical approaches in general, and that of Rawlsian approaches in particular, it is important not only to use empirical data but to use methodological insights from social sciences in order to further advance the field of empirical ethics. It is recommended that stakeholders be given a more active role in the assessment and justification of these methods. © Springer 2009.","Applied ethics; Conflicting values; Ethical methodology; Justification; Overlapping consensus; Rawls; Wide reflective equilibrium",

This may look somewhat idealistic or even naïve at first sight. However, we believe the arguments presented in this book build a strong case for working towards a more life-conducive economy. We have learned that there have been humanistic principles throughout history, within different religious and cultural traditions across the globe, as well as in the development of economic thought. In practice, we also increasingly find examples of humanists using entrepreneurial means to foster genuine life-serving developments, while topics such as business ethics, social entrepreneurship, and corporate social responsibility continuously deepen their footprint in management education and research. Clearly, building a more life-conducive economy and redefining the role of business in society accordingly means aiming high. Simultaneously, we should realize that our economic activities are not governed by laws of nature, but follow man-made rules.

Specifically, it aims to analyze relationships among these dimensions and diverse constructs, such as the relationship satisfaction, trust, identification with the firm, business performance, relational outcomes and loyalty. Design/methodology/approach - The benefits of corporate social responsibility as a marketing tool are analyzed in a real context, directly asking the user for his/her perceptions about the financial entities. A personal survey for users was carried out, obtaining 789 valid responses. In order to comply with the aims of this research a model of structural equations was developed. Findings - It is seen that the relationship satisfaction, trust and identification with the entity are the main determinants of loyalty, while the ethical and social dimensions have an indirect effect. The ethical behaviour influences the perceived commercial performance and it enhances trust, while corporate philanthropy improves the identification with the bank. Practical implications - The findings of this study indicate that social responsibility influences consumer behaviour and loyalty, so financial entities must especially take care of these aspects.

This increased interest is due largely to managers' desire to reduce the incidence of unwanted behaviors in the workplace. This article examines one major moderator of the ethical decision-making process - moral intensity. In particular, we explore the potential influence of a particular cognitive heuristic - the availability heuristic - on perceptions of moral intensity. It is our contention that moral intensity is a perceptual construct, and that individuals' use of the availability heuristic will influence perceptions of moral intensity which, in turn, will affect how moral issues are viewed and ultimately resolved. In this article, we present propositions concerning possible relationships between the availabilities of various phenomena and the components that moral intensity comprises, and report on two studies examining the effects of availabilities on two of these components: magnitude of consequences and social consensus. Our findings indicated that the availability of consequences associated with an act was positively related to perceptions of the magnitude of consequences of that act. We also found that the availability of others who believe that a particular act is morally acceptable is positively related to perceptions of social consensus that that act is morally acceptable.

This transformation occurred in response to changes in the competitive environment of U.S. corporations and also to the agency theory argument that high levels of compensation by means of stock options helped to overcome the agency problem inherent in the separation of ownership and control. Some critics charge that this new CEO role is objectionable for a variety of reasons, which may also be applicable to the current financial crisis in which CEO misconduct may have played a part. These objections are based largely on a team production model of corporate governance, which is held by these critics to be superior to the standard agent-principal model. This article examines the objections offered by critics of the changed role of the CEO and argues that their negative assessment of this development and their use of the team production model to support their conclusions are not warranted. CEOs have changed from hired hands to co-owners, and this change may have contributed in some measure to the current financial crisis.

The model focuses on three fundamental aspects of human resources: the different skill levels, the learning process and the social relationships existing in working teams. The resolution approach for the multi-objective problem consists of two steps: firstly, a set of non-dominated solutions is obtained by exploring the optimal Pareto frontier and secondly, based on further information, the ELECTRE III method is utilised to select the best compromise with regards to the considered objectives. The uncertainty associated to each solution is modelled by fuzzy numbers and used in establishing the threshold values of ELECTRE III, while the weights of the objectives are determined taking into account the influence that each objective has on the others.","ANP; ELECTRE III; Human resources allocation; Multi-objective optimisation","ELECTRE III; Fuzzy numbers; Human resources; Learning process; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Multiobjective optimisation; Nondominated solutions; Optimisations; Pareto frontiers; Skill levels; Social relationships; Fuzzy sets; Image retrieval; Personnel; Resource allocation; Multiobjective optimization"

The constant growth of the World Wide Web has triggered the appearance of complex systems to control and manage information. The hierarchical construction of classificatory systems has guaranteed the first footsteps for the formalization of online knowledge. Notwithstanding, some popular taxonomies (folksonomies) without neither default relationships among elements nor a precise point of departure, have been growing. These contemporary bottom-up processes inscribe social relationships in a network: they show that every phenomenon is interrelated, that nothing that exists is self-sufficient or independent, and that it is possible to manage a sustainable dimension of knowledge by means of a collaborative approach relating to information. Apart of analysing the connectivity between individuals also the social role of information must be considered. This role relates to the de-codification of links, bonds and contaminations between different layers of knowledge involved in everyday life. We claim that it is exactly in ""the space between"" these two different and interrelated dimensions, that is to say, the connectivity between individuals and the social role of information, that interactive design can find a new field for development. The main objectives of this paper are, firstly, to investigate ""the space between"" these two dimensions, decoding the idea of cybrid design; secondly, to explore which are the possibilities to overcome some limitations of the actual paradigm; and lastly, to point out how the use of technological systems that link the analogical and electronic dimensions of reality (like WiredBook and Electronic Margin) can trigger the emergence of an augmented hybrid reality which analysis can contribute to define new guidelines to facilitate a bottom-up construction of knowledge in a specific field.","Augmented reality; Bottom-up knowledge; Connected intelligence; Interactive design; Interconnectivity; Space in-between","Augmented reality; Complex networks; Design; Hierarchical systems; Online systems; World Wide Web; Bottom-up knowledge; Connected intelligence; Interactive design; Interconnectivity; Space in-between; Information management"

This is the crisis in social relations. In this article, Pierre-Yves Cusset asks the question ""are social relations in France in crisis?"" Do we still have shared values, national solidarity etc.? And if so, what do these things consist in? He begins by presenting the case that there is a crisis in social relations: the breakdown of the family unit, the increasing brittleness of family relationships, a questioning of the role of the public services, decreased participation in elections, increased levels of crime, problems of integration etc. He then shows that some of these developments, which, though they render social relations more brittle, are the ""down-side"" to new freedoms that extend the process of individualization (sexual tolerance, increased choice of relationships etc.). He emphasizes, in this way, that the fragility of private social relationships may be compensated for by their greater quantity and even perhaps their higher quality. Lastly, he shows that it is the preservation of the civil bond (which links everyone to society as a whole) that is trickiest, given recent developments, both where a sense of national belonging/identity and civility/civic-mindedness are concerned. And it is very much this civil bond which lies at the heart, in present-day France, of the challenge of constituting a society.",,

We examine why organizations within the same institutional field responded differently, delaying the industry response. We found that one population of firms was aligned with increasing pressures from its stakeholders for improved environmental performance, and the other was influenced by local cultural, political, and economic ideals less demanding of environmental actions.

It aims to deepen our understanding of such social practices in their cultural, social, economic and political contexts by examining portrayals of business and accounting transactions and of reflections of social and economic concerns in two German novels set during a time of economic and political crisis, namely the Weimar Republic's hyperinflation period. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses, against the historical, social and economic backgrounds of the inflation period, the novels' authors' social and political perspectives as reflected in the novels; the literary devices employed; the way in which the description of business and accounting matters aids our understanding of everyday inflation period transactions and underlying economic and social concerns; and the links made between accounting/business, money and inflation on the one hand, and morality and rationality on the other hand. Findings: The paper finds that in this exceptional economic situation, the relationship between accounting and morality as explored by Maltby is reversed. The portrayal of (often unusual and creative) economic transactions is used to illustrate the lack of economic, legal and moral certainty experienced by individuals and to evoke and critique the damage caused by the hyperinflation on German society and on human relationships, including the commoditisation of all aspects of life and the resulting moral decline. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature exploring the role of representations of business/accounting and finance in narrative fiction. The novels examined here provide an alternative means for observing, interpreting and critiquing social phenomena, specifically in a setting where financial considerations dominate human interaction and social relationships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fiction; Germany; History; Hyperinflation; Literature",

It is therefore, useful to understand how a corporate communication strategy can leverage these trends. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the take-up and use of new media in organizations, highlighting a current approach to implementation issues. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews and explores new media in organizations from three ecological layers: the social, discursive and technical, addressing who is communicating, the communication content and new media technology used. Findings - The paper recommends a customer-centered approach to implementing new media adoption in organizations using action research. Research limitations/implications - Academic literature is lagging behind the pace of technological change, and evaluation studies are limited. Originality/value - The paper shows how new media and Web 2.0 services can be employed to work in tandem with conventional communication tools such as phone, fax and corporate intranets. Such a hybrid approach enables organizations to maintain and strengthen existing stakeholder relationships, but also reach out and build relationships with new stakeholders who were previously inaccessible or invisible. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Action research; Communication management; Communication technologies; Corporate communications; Information media",

Second, while the majority of CR research conducted within business studies concentrates on the financial outcomes for the firm, the societal outcomes of CR are left largely unexplored.

The websites of the largest U.S.-based firms - according to the 2007 Fortune 500 list - are reviewed and their CSR efforts in Latin America are noted. The firms' positions on corporate citizenship in Latin America are mapped onto a three-by-three matrix in which firms' commitment to corporate citizenship ranges from profit-making motivations to a more holistic approach where support for non-profit causes is embraced by the entire firm and implemented at all levels (Marsden, Business and Society Review 105(1), 9-26, 2000). The largest U.S.-based multinationals were selected for this study because of their leadership role and the fact that other firms within their respective industries may seek to emulate the firms' level of commitment to corporate citizenship. While the matrix can be used to evaluate corporate citizenship efforts in any market - or globally - the emphasis in this study is on Latin America, a region of interest for two reasons: because of the paucity of research on this particular emerging market region as it relates to CSR, and because there is some evidence to suggest that philanthropic initiatives by the region's wealthy individuals lag behind individual philanthropic efforts in other world regions (Oppenheimer, Latin America's Rich Should Donate More. McClatchey-Tribune Regional News, 2007). If this is the case, this study aims to identify whether companies are picking up the slack.

This may stem from flawed analyses by regressing financial performance on corporate social performance, and/or perhaps from several inadequately controlled variables. Previous studies did not recognize investment in research and development as a critical variable because there is considerable empirical evidence to indicate that it has a strong positive impact on profitability. This misidentification creates biased estimates of the financial impact of CSR. Between 2002 and 2004, we examined 1000 Taiwanese cases in which firms include their R&D expenditures as one of their business strategies for sustainable development; they also identify their charitable expenditures as contributions to CSR. Based on theoretical assertions and empirical evidence in the literature, we identified a positive relationship between CSR and financial performance. When the model is properly specified, we found that while CSR does not have much positive impact on short-term financial performance, it does offer a remarkable long-term fiscal advantage. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

After discussing the emergence of business ethics as an academic discipline, it explores and attempts to answer two Marxist objections that might be brought against the enterprise of business ethics. The first is that business ethics is impossible because capitalism itself tends to produce greedy, overreaching, and unethical business behavior. The second is that business ethics is irrelevant because focusing on the moral or immoral conduct of individual firms or businesspeople distracts one's attention from the systemic vices of capitalism. I argue, to the contrary, that, far from being impossible, business requires and indeed presupposes ethics and that for those who share Marx's hope for a better society, nothing could be more relevant than engaging the debate over corporate social responsibility. In line with this, the article concludes by sketching some considerations favoring corporations' adopting a broader view of their social and moral responsibilities, one that encompasses more than the pursuit of profit. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics (as academic subject); Corporate social responsibility; Fiduciary responsibility; Friedman; Marxism; Milton; Prisoner's dilemma; Profit maximization",

It is now widely accepted that the private sector is a crucial partner in achieving this ambitious target. Building on this insight, the 'Bottom of the Pyramid' concept provides a framework that highlights the untapped opportunities with the 'poorest of the poor', while at the same time acknowledging the abilities and resources of private enterprises for poverty alleviation. This article connects the idea of business with the poor to sustainable development and especially to the notions of inter- and intragenerational justice. These principles of justice can be linked with the 'Bottom of the Pyramid' approach directly through the Rawlsian principles to foster holistic thinking. On this basis, the article offers a normative-ethical reasoning of corporations' possible responsibilities for the poorest of the poor. Today's state of worldwide inequalities is likely to generate future tensions between the privileged western world and the uncounted mass of poor (let alone the ethical dubiousness of this status). However, it is at the same time problematic if not even impossible to improve the situation of the poor by simply copying the resource intensive western way of living to the 'Bottom of the Pyramid' due to the limited carrying capacity of the earth. After highlighting possible moral dilemmas which may occur through such a potential trade off, this article concludes with an outlook on how the concepts 'Bottom of the Pyramid' and sustainable development could be combined. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bottom of the Pyramid; Categorical imperative; Corporate citizenship; Human rights; Intra- and intergenerational equity; Moral dilemma; Poverty alleviation; Rawlsian principles; Sustainable development",

However, they also provide a socially useful service by making prices better reflect true values, protecting other investors from purchasing overpriced securities. Short sellers can also help to provide liquidity in the markets. Recently, there has been a hue and cry against so called ""naked"" short selling, which involves not delivering the shares that have been sold. This gives manipulators a tool for depressing stock prices and deprives purchasers of voting rights and potential stock lending revenue.

While few, if any, will be able to escape totally the effects of climate change, it will fall most heavily, at least initially, on the poor, regardless of where they reside. We may observe already possible scenarios. The tragic situation in Darfur may be less an ethnic conflict and more a clash between marginal farmers and herdsmen in an increasingly more arid local climate. More powerful storms on the scale of hurricane Katrina, which affected the poor more than other economic groups, may become commonplace. The alteration of the maple sugar cycle may be a harbinger of stress on the world's flora and fauna that humanity depends upon. Mainstream climatologists have concluded that human behavior, primarily the effects of industrialization, causes human-induced climate change. Left unchecked climate change will have serious consequences for humanity, especially the poor. Business, the primary agent of industrialization, is both the problem and the solution.

Consistent with past studies, we find that the two variables appear to be related when we use traditional statistical techniques. However, using a time series fixed effects approach, we find that the relation between CSR and financial performance is much weaker than previously thought. We also find little evidence of causality between financial performance and narrower measures of social performance that focus on stakeholder management. Our results suggest that strong stock market performance leads to greater firm investment in aspects of CSR devoted to employee relations, but that CSR activities do not affect financial performance. We conclude that CSR is driven more by unobservable firm characteristics than by financial performance. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Corporate culture; Corporate governance; Social responsibility",

It considers how the concept has come to be framed within Japanese business, which is increasingly globalized and internationally focused, yet continues to exhibit strong cultural specificities. The discussion is based on interviews with managers who deal with CSR issues and strategy on a day-to-day basis from 13 multinational companies. In looking at how CSR practice has been adopted and adapted by Japanese corporations, we can begin to see what implications arise from the fact that CSR is a Western-led concept, so opening up critical questions about the future development and evolution of CSR practice within a global context. In being exposed to the concept of CSR as practiced vigilantly in western countries, Japanese multinational company managers have certainly come to re-evaluate aspects of business likely to need rectifying (with potential concerns being gender inequalities, discrepancies in employee conditions, and issues over human rights and supply chains). Japan can be thought to be lagging behind in its understanding and adoption of CSR, in part because corporations do not necessarily state their policies as formally as might be expected. Yet, by analyzing more deeply the kinds of responses gained from CSR managers in Japan (and by placing their remarks within a broader context of Japanese culture and business practices) a far more subtle and revealing picture becomes apparent, not least a more complex picture of the local/global interaction of the frames of reference of corporate responsibility. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR managers; Globalization; Japanese multinational companies; Sustainability",

One example of business leaders engagement in citizenship activities is PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) leadership development program called ""Project Ulysses"" which we present and discuss in this article. Using a narrative approach we ask: ""What can business leaders learn from selected Ulysses narratives for acting as agents of world benefit and with respect to engaging responsibly in the fight against some of the most pressing social problems at the local level?"" Our contribution is organized as follows. We begin the article with a brief discussion on the role of business leaders in the fight against world's social problems and address some areas of concern as to whether or not business leaders should play a role in fighting these global issues. We then introduce ""Project Ulysses"" which takes place in cross-sector partnership in developing countries. Following an overview of the research methodology we present four Ulysses narratives which tell us about learnings in the light of fundamental human problems, such as poverty and misery. Each story is analyzed with regard to the above question.

Knobe's explanation of this data is that people determine intentionality based on the moral consideration of whether the side effect is good or bad. This observation and explanation has come to be known as the ""Knobe Effect."" One implication from the Knobe Effect is that it seems profit-driven businesses can only intentionally cause harmful and never good side effects. This paper examines the Knobe Effect, and argues for a way that business persons can understand it and avoid its implications. The argument has three parts. The first point is that business persons who care only about profits are blameworthy and rightly should not get credit for good side effects. Second, when a morally praiseworthy person who cares about values other than profits causes side effects, her actions are intentional and praiseworthy. Therefore, profit-driven business persons can be praised for intentionally producing good side effects if they consider other moral values as moral agents should. Finally, morally praiseworthy business persons need only to be Minimally Good Samaritans and not totally altruistic. When a business person strives for profits, adheres to other morally important values, and produces morally good side effects, then we should say that she intentionally caused those effects and is praiseworthy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Doctine of double effect; Environmental ethics; Experimental philosophy; Intentionality; Knobe Effect; Side effects",

The results show that, among the eight selection factors that were studied, technical competence in accounting, communication skills, and interpersonal skills were the most influential, while professionalism and leadership abilities were the least important. Ethics was ranked fourth by the females and sixth by the males. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences between the genders with respect to five of the eight factors.

Specifically, this study investigates ethical perceptions, religiosity, personal moral philosophies, corporate ethical values, gender, and ethical intentions of U.S. and Moroccan business managers. The findings demonstrate that significant differences do exist between the two countries in idealism and relativism. Moroccan managers tend to be more idealistic than the U.S. managers. There is a strong positive relationship between religiosity and idealism. There were mixed findings in examining the correlates of religiosity and various components of ethical intentions. Moroccan managers were more homogenous in their corporate ethical values than were the U.S. managers. The results demonstrate that (in general) idealism is a good predictor of ethical intentions and behaviors. Additionally, managers from the two countries differed in the degree of relationship between perceptions and intentions in three of the four scenarios.

While an important body of work, ethical breaches are often found to cut across job functions and involve multiple disciplines embedded in a business organization. This research seeks to explore a cross-functional explanation for ethical reasoning by using an instrument new to business ethics research, the Wason selection task, but well-grounded and validated in cognitive research and evolutionary psychology, to assess an individual's ability to detect rule-based social contract violations. A sample of 276 full-time business practitioners, enrolled in part-time M.B.A. programs, from the accounting, finance, information technology, marketing, supply chain, and human resource management job functions were compared on their ability to detect rule violators across a series of production scenarios in the Wason selection task. Rates of cheater detection were calculated to determine if substantive differences existed across job functions. This was followed by a series of pair-wise comparisons of percentages of cheater detection across the job functions using z-tests for assessing statistical significance. The data analysis showed differences in cheater detection, with most of the variance due to the marketing job function group.

In particular, ethical principles are important in the industries of health care and other services that deal directly with human beings. Indeed, ethical principles are important for treating customers, users and consumers of service industries firms, but they also apply to other stakeholders of the service firm. This article shows that the basic ethical principles do not only apply at the individual level, but also get their significance at the organisational level. Thus, the ethical ideas of autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability are very important in order to propose an ethical framework for value-driven management of service industries firms.

If a company thinks its managers might leave in the near future, would there be reasons for it to provide continuous training of these professionals? Do companies interpret all likely resignations in the same way? We attempt to provide an answer to these questions, by analysing the behaviour of companies' vis-a-vis continuous management training in terms of their expectations of the appropriability of the benefits that stem from such training. Appropriability is in turn assessed with regard to firms' expectations that their managers will leave their organisation without it having had the chance to recover the outlay invested in training. The analysis of business behaviour also demands an understanding of how these turnover expectations are produced and, more specifically, of the variables on which turnover expectations depend or might depend. The empirical study we carried out with over 300 Spanish companies revealed that company projections for voluntary turnover of management employees are positively connected with earlier experiences of turnover, with markets prone to change, and with business risk situations, and negatively associated with developed social management networks, satisfied managers and their degree of specificity in relation to the company. Nevertheless, no significant relationship was observed between expected turnover and the intensity of continuous management training. In general, companies make their management training investment decisions independently of the overall turnover expectations they might have. Different causes might exist for this absence of a relationship, centred in particular on the need for management training and an associated sense of urgency, which takes precedence over the risk of not recovering the investment when the business decision is taken, and on the nature of the management turnover perceived by the company, which is more complex than a strictly economic one.","Appropriability; Continuous Management Training; Internal labour markets; Managers; Moral hazard; Readiness; Turnover",

The paper aims to look at patterns of leadership practice developing in firms in this regard and what might be shaping them. It also seeks to consider current practices in light of movement toward next-generation corporate citizenship. Design/methodology/approach - The study surveyed a representative sample of Fortune 500 companies. To benchmark how companies are embedding citizenship into their governance, structure, and systems, two scorecards were devised measuring practices pertaining to: Corporate Board Governance; and Operational Management of Corporate Citizenship. Criteria chosen represent Board and management policies, behaviors, and/or public commitments. Findings - It was found that, while corporate Boards are assuming more responsibility for oversight of conduct and taking account of specific social and environmental issues, citizenship is not yet fully embedded into Boards or the operating structures and systems of most firms. Research limitations/implications - Companies appear to be moving through developmental stages as they integrate citizenship into their governance and operations, with several developmental patterns emerging. While there seem to be specific patterns of development that link to the industry, issues faced, and culture of firms, it is difficult to generalize specific influences within industry from the relatively small sample. Further benchmarking is needed to better understand these issues and which ideas represent best practices going forward. Practical implications - A next generation approach to corporate citizenship requires more than top down advocacy - this needs to be backed up by Board oversight and engagement and by layered management structures, systems, processes, and policies that make citizenship part of every employee's remit, across the company's value chain. Originality/value - The paper provides a unique set of frameworks to assess company performance in relation to governing and managing corporate citizenship.

Consequently, this New Public was unable to form genuine opinions or interpret public policy.

Design/methodology/approach - A normative approach has been adopted and the research is based, primarily, on an examination of relevant literature. Findings - Society facilities the growth of economic entities by providing them with resources. As their command over resources increases, these entities gain significant economic, social and political power and accountability is demanded of their managers as a check on possible abuse of this power. Historically, as companies have increased their power in society, those to whom and that for which their managers are held accountable have been extended. Today, the managers of large public companies are considered to be accountable to society as a whole for a wide range of corporate activities. The discharge of corporate accountability traditionally relied on the preparation and audit of accountability reports (financial statements). However, from the 1990s, responding to the increasing severity of the impact on society of unexpected corporate failures - and continued failures - responsible corporate governance was added as an accountability requirement. Further, as the activities for which companies are accountable have been extended (paralleling the growth of their ""power"" in society), so corporate responsibility information has featured as an element in their accountability reports. As these changes have occurred, the importance of the tripartite audit function in securing corporate accountability has come to be recognised and its members - the company's external and internal auditors and its audit committee - have become increasingly multi-disciplinary in nature.

The lack of skills, finance and knowledge are found to be prohibiting the effective embedment of sustainable development within companies and hence cause an under-performance in this regard. The study concludes that the establishing of a new business model for sustainable development in China is needed urgently, and this should be a joint effort with the Chinese government.

The article concludes that greening companies such as Shell - that are not born green - might be considerably advanced if these companies strengthen their relationships with companies such as Vestas - that are born green. This is so since companies that are born green have strong green ecocentric business beliefs that can function as important engines in shared green sense-making with companies that are not born green and have more hesitant green beliefs.

The proposed PO-CSR 2 framework encompasses four complementary means of framing public opinion: the philosophy of measurement of the market view (PO1); the action theory of the mobilization view (PO2); the negative, constraining mode of the social control view (PO3); and the proactive stance of the strategic enactment view (PO4). The article unfolds the particular characteristics of these four views and shows how they, individually and in conjunction, can serve as useful tools for understanding and analyzing corporate social responsiveness. Far from being a narrow concept that focuses attention mainly on the popularĝ€""and, some would say, superficialĝ€"" aspects of responsiveness, the author argues that public opinion is a concept that embodies variety and provides a multifaceted point of departure for reflections on the relationship between business and society. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsiveness; Environmental assessment; Issues management; Public opinion theory; Stakeholder management",

Although most studies indicate that CSP is a determinant of CFP, other aspects of this research have been inconsistent. Some studies are criticized for using unreliable CSP measures; others for missing control variables; and still others for assuming linearity without valid testing. This paper responds to these issues with an updated study of the CSP-CFP relationship, testing two approaches to measuring CSP, controlling for key variables identified in the literature, and testing for nonlinearity of certain independent variables. Chief among our findings is a positive CSP-CFP relationship, which supports proponents of stakeholder theory. We also determine that empirical models specifying two CSP component measures are stronger than those using a fully aggregated measure. Lastly, we find that control variables must be properly specified to avoid bias and that some of these measures are quadratically related to CFP.

A morally managed and a self-interested firm compete in a market in which their corporate social performance (CSP) provides product differentiation. Some citizens have altruistic or warm glow preferences for products with associated CSP, personal giving to social causes, holding shares in firms providing CSP, and contributing to social pressure to increase CSP. Social pressure is delivered by an activist NGO funded by voluntary contributions by citizens. The model characterizes an equilibrium in the product market, the capital market, and the market for social pressure. The equilibrium establishes a price for CSP and for activist-induced social pressure. The theory provides predictions of the market values of firms, the prices of products, firm profits, target selection, contributions to the activist, and the amount of CSP supplied. For example, if citizens do not distinguish between morally motivated CSP and CSP induced by social pressure, the activist is more likely to target the softer, morally motivated firm. Higher quality activists are better funded, target self-interested firms, and obtain greater corporate social performance. Lower quality activists target morally managed firms. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,

Drawing from signaling theory, we hypothesized that an environmental message on the organization's recruitment website would increase prospective applicants' perceptions of organizational prestige, which would then increase job pursuit intentions. Personal environmental attitudes were also examined as a possible moderator. Design/Methodology/Approach Participants (N = 183) viewed a web site printout that either did or did not contain a message indicating the organization's environmental support. Participants rated their attitudes toward the environment, perceptions of the organization, and job pursuit intentions. Findings Findings demonstrated that the environmental support message positively affected job pursuit intentions; further, this effect was mediated by perceptions of the organization's reputation. Contrary to the person-organization fit perspective, the message's effects on job pursuit intentions were not contingent upon the participant's own environmental stance. Implications These findings highlight the importance of corporate social performance as a source of information for a variety of job seekers. Even relatively small amounts of information regarding corporate social performance can positively affect an organization's reputation and recruitment efforts. Originality/Value In general, this research contributes to the growing body of literature on corporate social responsibility. It is the first study to test whether the effects of pro-environmental recruiting messages on job pursuit intentions depend upon an applicant's personal environmental stance.

Traditionally, business ethics research emphasized the effects of overt or explicit attitudes on ethical decision-making and neglected intuitive or implicit attitudes. Therefore, based on an implicit social cognition approach it is important to know whether implicit moral attitudes may have a substantial impact on managerial ethical decision-making processes. To test this thesis, a study with 50 participants was conducted. In this study the participants were asked to work on a deliberative managerial ethical decision-making task, in which they had to decide on one of two options. Implicit moral attitudes towards the two options were measured using the implicit association test (IAT). A semantic differential scale was used to diagnose explicit moral attitudes towards the two options. Each step taken within the deliberative decision-making process, as well the decision itself, was assessed using a scoring model-based decision analysis and a decision-making questionnaire. The results of this study show that implicit moral attitude has a great influence on the deliberative ethical decision-making process. The derived conclusion is that complex and deliberative decision-making processes in the context of business ethics can be affected by implicit social cognitions such as implicit moral attitudes. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Ethical decision-making; Implicit association test (IAT); Implicit attitudes; Implicit social cognition; Mental processes; Moral judgements",

Cases here analyzed demonstrate that alternative ways of doing business are possible. These enterprises share more democratic ownership structures, more balanced and broader governance systems, and a more comprehensive view of organizational goals and performance - which goes beyond the narrow concept of financial bottom line and into a stronger and systematic care of the needs and requirements of the different stakeholder groups.

In this paper, we employ an institutional economics framework to examine the legal environment in several English-speaking countries in order to determine potential constraints that might cause managers to avoid the adoption of such systems. Our findings indicate that in British Commonwealth countries (1) the courts tend to view stockholders as the primary corporate constituency group and (2) there is a lack of documentary privilege. Therefore, any internally generated metrics on ethics and corporate social responsibility matters could potentially be either trivialized or used against the corporation in court proceedings. Before adopting a voluntary ethics measurement system, managers should be aware of these and other potential institutional constraints that may impede such efforts.",,

To the contrary, its point is that evolutionary psychology is a potentially useful method among many others to help us to better understand our ""moral universe."" However, evolutionary psychology will never allow us to pierce through ""the illusions that evolution and culture have saddled us with"" as the psychologist Steven Pinker over-promises. This is true for the simple reason that science itself is both a product of evolution and a cultural practice. The aspiration of some evolutionary psychologists to transcend evolution (nature) and culture (nurture) through science is itself a dangerous illusion. Nevertheless, evolutionary psychology's modest findings to date are a welcome contribution to anyone interested in making better and wiser ethical decisions, business or otherwise.

But, as in all abstractions, this truth comes at the expense of falsehood - namely, that persons are assets to deploy on behalf of owners.

Two competing hypotheses are entertained. The shareholder view predicts that stronger takeover protection will lead to a decrease in corporate attention to shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders alike, as managers divert resources from share-holders to the pursuit of their private interests. The stakeholder view, in contrast, predicts that stronger takeover protection will increase corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Because catering to non-shareholding stakeholders contributes to the long-term value of the firm, managers will be more likely to attend to those stakeholders when relieved from short-termism triggered by the threat of hostile takeovers. Using a sample of 878 U.S. firms from 1991 to 2002, the study finds that an exogenous increase in takeover protection leads to higher corporate attention to community and the natural environment, but has no impact on corporate attention to employees, minorities, and customers. Additional analyses show that firms that increase their attention to stakeholders experience an increase in long-term shareholder value. These findings provide additional evidence that relief from short-termism is a likely source of the increase in corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders following the increase in takeover protection. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Agency theory; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Shareholder value; Short-termism; Stakeholder management","Industrial management; Managers; Agency theory; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Shareholder value; Short-termism; Stakeholder management; Shareholders"

The study employs interview and questionnaire analysis to examine the part played by a range of factors in supporting effective governance. Research Findings/Results: The findings suggest that pervasive corruption and weaknesses in underlying frameworks have hampered attempts to improve practice. The results indicate that the mere emergence of detailed governance codes in developing countries does not necessarily mean that de facto practices will improve. Theoretical Implications: The results suggest that corporate governance standards in developing countries may appear on paper to be broadly similar to those in developed countries. However, a widespread perception exists that Ugandan frameworks are not yet strong enough to support what might normally be considered to be ""good"" practice. Sound corporate governance is seen as being a multi-faceted notion, with a range of political and social frameworks requiring strengthening before meaningful improvements can be made. Practical Implications: The evidence indicates that attempts to improve governance standards in a particular nation require more than the simple publication of codes of best practice. Root and branch changes in a wide-range of contextual factors, including at political and cultural levels, are required to provide the conditions in which meaningful improvements in corporate governance will occur. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Africa; Business Ethics; Corporate Governance; Government; Stakeholders",

However, what about the major companies from the new Central-Eastern Europe (CEE) Member States? The present paper is one of the first attempts to analyse the understanding and relevance of the CR of some major CEE companies that are leaders in sustainability reporting. This analysis is conducted in direct comparison with a similar analysis on major Western European companies. Methodologically, the paper intertwines two qualitative strands of research: an analysis of 19 CR reports (12 from CEE and 7 from Western Europe) provides a general impression about the understanding of CR across different socio-political contexts. This report-based depiction is complemented by two surveys of 22 companies (11 from CEE and 11 from Western Europe). The surveys show the relevance that the companies attach to specific CR issues. Overall, the paper concludes that the understanding of CR is context-specific, but also that, in the case of major companies that are leading in CR reporting, the differences are not as stark as one might expect. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose that the life-course model of deviance can help account for this attenuation of acquiescence in misbehavior. As employees learn to perceive informal prosocial control during their socialization into the workforce, we hypothesize that they will become more willing to blow the whistle on misconduct. Analysis of the 2003 NBES (n = 1,417, with a subset of 314 who observed misconduct) reveals that young and short-tenured employees do perceive less informal prosocial control, and that informal prosocial control does boost whistle-blowing; however, tests for mediation of the relationship between youth and short-tenure and whistle-blowing by informal social control were largely negative, suggesting that other explanations are still needed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Age; Criminology; Deviance; Life-course; Whistle-blowing",

Simultaneously, there is a growing tendency among different institutional investors to take into account nonfinancial aspects - social, environmental, and ethical values - of company management. In this respect, increasing numbers of asset managers are aware of the importance of nonfinancial aspects of company management for finance markets. Asset managers integrate corporate social responsibility, sustainability policies and corporate governance strategies as indicators in risk management and the search for long-term investments. The largest segment of socially responsible investment (SRI) screened and mutual funds are portfolios that are privately managed on behalf of institutions. Socially responsible investors include private and public pension funds, mutual funds, and private accounts that are managed on behalf of institutional investors such as corporations, universities, hospitals, religious institutions, and nonprofit organizations, among others. The aim of this paper is to analyze the development of SRI-screened management corporate pension plans in the Spanish finance market. Spain is one of the European countries with a less developed SRI institutional market. Since SRI is still at the fledgling stage in the Spanish institutional market, this analysis is restricted to the awareness of SRI among a sample of the total number of corporate pension funds or schemes in Spain.

However, it may be argued that a sustainable business model for the long-term requires a detailed understanding of the various factors that may help ISPs in attracting future customers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the drivers and barriers of consumer adoption of broadband in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - A survey research approach was utilised to examine the effect of a number of constructs from attitudinal (utilitarian outcomes and hedonic outcomes), normative (social influence), control (self-efficacy and facilitating conditions resources) and demographic (age) categories on the behaviour of consumers when adopting broadband in the UK. Findings - Results indicate that all the constructs, apart from hedonic outcomes, significantly influenced the adoption behaviour of consumers. Research limitations/implications - This study provides a snapshot of the adoption behaviour of broadband within UK households. The findings may therefore change as technology becomes established and consumers become more experienced in its use. By undertaking a longitudinal study, the elimination of any variables could achieve anomalies in the obtained results. In addition to a discussion of the findings, the paper outlines the contributions and limitations of the study and provides suggestions for future research activity.

This article goes beyond the popular view to examine where the real action typically occurs - in the Dialogue process where corporations and shareholder activist groups mutually agree to ongoing communications to deal with a serious social issue. Use of the capitalized word ""Dialogue"" is intended to distinguish this formal process between corporations and shareholders from all the other forms of dialogue or two-way communication exchanged between a corporation and its stakeholders. The phenomenon of Dialogue between a corporation and dissident shareholders has not been analyzed in the academic literature or in the popular press because it occurs behind the scenes and out of sight from media scrutiny. Yet this is where a great deal of social change initiated by shareholder activists is negotiated. This article contributes both theoretically and empirically to the study of Dialogues between shareholder activists and corporations. We explain how Dialogues occur in the context of the shareholder resolution process and examine two Dialogues that focus on international labor issues in two industries. Then data on Dialogues during the period, 1999-2005, from the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility are analyzed.

However, while some companies (e.g., Henkel, BHP, Johnson and Johnson) have a long standing tradition in reporting non-financial information, other companies provide only limited information, or in some cases, no information at all. Previous studies have suggested that there are, country and industry-specific, differences in the extent of CSR reports (e.g., Kolk et al.: 2001, Business Strategy and the Environment 10, 15-28; Kolk: 2005, Management International Review 45, 145-166; Maignan and Ralston: 2002, Journal of International Business Studies 33(3), 497-514). However, findings are inconclusive or contradictory and it is often difficult to compare previous studies owing to the idiosyncratic methods used in each study (Graafland et al.: 2004, Journal of Business Ethics 53, 137-152). Furthermore, previous studies have relied mainly on simple measures, such as word counts and page counts of reports, to compare the extent of reporting that may not capture significant differences in the content of the reports. In this article, we seek to overcome some of these deficiencies by using textual analysis software and a more robust statistical method to more objectively and reliably compare the CSR reports of firms in different industries and countries. We examine a sample of leading companies in four countries (US, UK, Australia, and Germany) and test whether or not membership of the Global Compact makes a difference to CSR reporting and is overcoming industry and country specific factors that limit standardization. We conclude that GlobalCompact membership is having an effect only in certain areas of CSR reporting, related to the environment and workers, and that businesses from different countries vary significantly in the extent to which they promote CSR and the CSR issues that they choose to emphasize in their reports. These country differences are argued to be related to the different institutional arrangements in each country. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Content analysis; Corporate social responsibility; Country; Global Compact; Global standards; Industry; Leximancer",

Zipcar, the world's largest and fastest growing car club, merges a Web 2.0 brand presence with the customer-orientated responsiveness of organizations. Everything is done online from registering, booking and billing. Cars are parked in clusters in dedicated locations close to homes and offices. Car sharing creates less congestion on the roadways and fewer greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric pollutants. Besides protecting the environment and bringing down CO2 by moving car owners to the concept, the solution imparts authorities with a positive opportunity for better city planning, handing them the opportunity to affect traffic intensity and parking issues positively.",,"Atmospheric pollutants; Car rental; City planning; On-Demand; Service systems; Sustainable business; Traffic intensity; Urban areas; Web 2.0; Air pollution; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Regional planning"

It identifies the crux of MacIntyre's critique as centering on the fundamental Aristotelian concepts of internal goods and practices. MacIntyre essentially follows Aristotle in arguing that by privileging external goods over internal goods, business activity - and certainly modern capitalistic business activity - corrupts practices. Thus, from the perspective of virtue ethics, business is morally indefensible. The paper continues with an evaluation of MacIntyre's arguments. The conclusion is drawn that MacIntyre's critique, although partially valid, does not vitiate modern business as he claims. In short, modern business need not of necessity be antithetical to individuals' pursuit of internal goods within practices. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Capitalism; Macintyre; Virtue",

Golden parachutes ensure effective corporate governance that, in turn, preserve the firm's value for all stakeholders.

Emphasis has been on strategies for managing operational risk and the benefits of a more integrated approach to the overall risks affecting a company. However, it is unclear whether these new approaches to risk management have been accepted and implemented by the industry. Based on interviews with 20 experienced chief risk officers working in Swedish industry, this explorative study aims at investigating and analyzing current opinions and considerations on the implementation of operational risk management (ORM). The development toward more integrated risk management approaches as proposed in the enterprise risk management (ERM) is also in focus. The results of the interviews indicate that the Swedish industry approach to ORM is today rarely a strictly formalized, straightforward activity. Instead informal, decentralized, pragmatic, bottom-up approaches to ORM are preferred over an ERM approach to overall risk exposures. The respondents stressed that their companies' activities with ORM had been guided by the Swedish regulatory (precautionary) approach, notably regarding environmental and occupational risks. Stakeholders such as the financial markets and insurers, as well as various guidelines and policy documents relating to corporate responsibility and corporate governance had further directed the development. However, as a result of stricter international regulation relating to ORM and ERM, it is likely that incentives for more formalized risk management approaches will emerge also in Sweden. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.","ERM; Operational risk management; Stakeholder analysis; Swedish industry",

Applying Forsyth's (1980, 1992) personal moral philosophy model which consists of two independent ethical ideology dimensions, idealism and relativism, we hypothesized and found support for a positive relationship between creativity and relativism. It appears that creative people are less likely than non-creative people to follow universal rules in their moral decision making. However, contrary to our hypothesis and the general stereotype that creative people are less caring about others, we found a positive relationship between creativity and idealism. These findings indicate that highly creative people are likely to be what Forsyth called ""situationists,"" individuals with both an ethic of caring and a pragmatic moral decision-making style. The finding that creative individuals tend to be situationists, and particularly that they tend to be high in idealism, appears to refute the line of reasoning that argues for a ""creative personality"" characterized in part by social insensitivity.

It is tempting to think that these conflicts can be morally resolved if we gained full knowledge of the situations, were rational enough, and were sufficiently objective. This paper explores the view that there are situations in which people in business must confront the possibility that they must compromise some of their important principles or values in order to protect other ones. One particularly interesting case that captures this kind of situation is that of Google and its operations in China. In this paper, I examine the situation Google faces as part of the larger issue of moral compromise and integrity in business. Though I look at Google, this paper is just as much about the underlying or background views Google faces that are at work in business ethics. In the process, I argue the following: First, the framework Google has used to respond to criticisms of its actions does not successfully or obviously address the important ethical issues it faces. Second, an alternative ethical account can be presented that better addresses these ethical and human rights questions. However, this different framework brings the issue of moral compromise to the fore. This is an approach filled with dangers, particularly since it is widely held that one ought never to compromise one's moral principles. Nevertheless, I wish to propose that there may be a place for moral compromise in business under certain conditions, which I attempt to specify. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Censorship; China; Google; Human rights; Moral compromise",

Prescriptions offered to address this crisis draw accordingly on the need for greater regulation of market behaviour, business practices and boardroom pay. Whilst these reforms are necessary, they fail to recognise that such business practices have their roots in an extreme political and economic ideology - neoliberal market fundamentalism. This paper seeks to suggests that a greater appreciation of the nexus between politics, philosophy and economics is critical in order to develop a different practice. As such, the author provides a socio-historical and political context for understanding the present crisis before offering a critique and reform of the business educational agenda. The author argues that such a context would engender greater understanding of business practices and systems for both students and practitioners and would go some way in enabling them to fashion a more critical reflexive and engaged practice. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on a critical-historical review of the literature on the crisis. In so doing, the paper opens up the analysis to philosophical and political approaches to understanding financial crises. Findings: The paper finds that explanations for the crisis can be found through a critical appreciation of philosophical and political texts. This finding also suggests that current business and management education and practices can benefit from an incorporation of these historical strands of thought. Research limitations/implications: In drawing on various strands in philosophy, politics, economics and sociology, the paper finds that a singular account for the crisis is flawed. The paper also finds that a richer and deeper appreciation of the crisis can be found through a critical-historical positioning of the crisis. This necessitates an understanding of politics and philosophy in business practices and education. Practical implications: In explaining the crisis, the paper suggests that many of the current financial innovations are problematic and a more critical approach is needed to engage with these new innovations. Originality/value: The paper seeks to open up new vistas for business education and practices. Through a critical-historical interrogation of the crisis, the paper opens up new spaces for understanding international economics and business practices.

However, when analysing an organisations' adoption of sustainable practices, it is often clear-within the UK-that there are few activities that have been undertaken as an ethical stance instead of legal obligation (McCormick in Environmental politics and policy in industrialized countries, MIT, London, 2002). Our hypothesis is that most methodologies and practices for environmental management do not adopt a holistic perspective, causing significant problems in implementation from inadequate structures and communication channels (Espinosa et al. in Eur J Oper Res, 187:636-651, 2008). In particular we consider that most organisations are currently stifled with management hierarchies that prevent informal/social networking, which may be one of the most powerful natural forms for self-organisation. It is proposed that sustainable development requires more efficient communication channels that foster self-organisation and self-regulation as a method for more productive change processes. In this paper, we explain the reasons why meta-systemic principles of self-organisation and distributed network management offer clear criteria to design an environmental management system that operates on the basis of self-controlled individuals and communities. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Cybernetics; Environmental studies; Informal networking; Sustainable development; System dynamics",

Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on research conducted in Chile where a combination of self-completion questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation was carried out in a non-probabilistic sample of 46 organisations. Findings: Findings suggest that there is a shared definition of work characterised by five elements; namely, the existence of great work pressure exerted by managers; a sustained focus of upper levels on organisational efficiency as an isolated element that does not include HRM; the inexistence of worker autonomy and empowerment; the use of administrative jargon and understandings of loyalty, dedication, compliance and professionalism as desired qualities in workers. The paper argues that there are three distinct categories of cultural discourse in Chilean organisations: pessimistic/fatalistic, optimistic/maniac and pragmatic/bureaucratic. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the type of sampling used, findings cannot be taken to represent the whole of Chilean organisations. Practical implications: Data presented in this paper help in understanding many of the behaviours observed in Chilean organisations, which provides HR policy-makers and practitioners with sounder foundations for designing organisational programs, policies and action plans.

To contribute to the discussion on the meaning of work in Korea, this article starts by reporting findings from a review of Korean literature.The article further presents findings from a survey of both managerial and union members on the perceived importance of core values in the workplace. Among four people-centered core values, human-centered management/human resource development and knowledge sharing were the values preferred by the managerial group. Managers placed more importance on accountability values, among which obedience to the law was significantly emphasized by the managers.With respect to the social responsibility values, the managerial group scored higher for the value of social responsibility, faithful tax payment, and transparency of information disclosure with no significant difference.As to the leadership values, the managerial group's scores were higher for flexibility and capacity for change management, vision formation, and implementation capacity.The article closes with a discussion of the findings, limitations of this research, recommendations for further research, and the practical implications. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Business ethics; Core values; Korea",

Design/methodology/approach: The approach takes the form of survey research and case studies. The paper is informed by corporate image and reputation research undertaken for major international corporations, governments and NGOs in the UK and in countries throughout the world dating back to the late 1960s. Findings: The paper finds that corporate image is an important factor in the success or failure of virtually all major organisations; corporate reputation is the synthesis of many factors: the brand(s) image, the products (and/or services) class image(s), the brand user(s) image, the image of the country of perceived ownership of a corporation, and the corporate culture/personality; corporate reputations can be measured, and changes in corporate reputations can be tracked; and corporate responsibility is replacing corporate social responsibility as an increasingly important factor in how people regard the corporate reputation of organisations. Practical implications: Policy makers should actively research and manage their corporate reputation. Familiarity breeds favourability, not contempt. All too often senior managers and their advisers (brand and corporate consultants, design consultants, advertising and public relations advisers, etc.), who have responsibility for the organisation's corporate reputation, muddle the distinctions between corporate reputation, corporate image, corporate identity, corporate personality, corporate culture, and other ways by which the elements of the corporate reputation are defined, and therefore used and measured.

Respondents were asked to respond to the Ethics Position Questionnaire developed by Forsyth (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 39(1), 175-184, 1980), in order to determine their idealism and relativism levels. Subsequently, they answered questions about five scenarios related to accounting practices, with the objective of measuring their ethical judgments. Based on the idealism and relativism levels of our respondents, they were classified into one of four groups, representing different ethical ideologies (absolutism, exceptionism, subjectivism, and situationism). The results indicated that age was the major determinant of relativism. Contrary to previous research, older respondents revealed themselves significantly more relativistic than younger ones. Gender seems to be the most important determinant of ethical judgments; against expectations, men evidenced significantly stricter judgments than women in two of the five scenarios. Findings also indicated that respondents' ethical judgments did not differ significantly based on their ethical ideology, supporting the idea that ethical ideology is not an important determinant of ethical judgments. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accounting; Business ethics; Ethical decision-making; Ethical ideology; Ethical judgment; Ethics",

In this article, we empirically derive a framework that measures the performance of CDFIs through an analysis of their stakeholder relationships. Based on qualitative data from 20 English CDFIs, we develop a typology of CDFIs according to three dimensions: organisational structure, type of lending and type of market served.

The authors aim to show how prior dyadic relations with a stakeholder and perception of situational demands on the relationship determine the choice of aggressive vs cooperative strategies in managing stakeholder relationships. Design/methodology/approach - To develop a blueprint for predicting collaboration strategies, literature on stakeholder theory, stakeholder management strategies, field theory, and organizational mental models was surveyed. From the literature, 31 predictors of eight stakeholder management strategies were identified. To operationalize the study's constructs, results of a national survey were analyzed to determine the significant predictors of stakeholder management strategies. Findings - Factor analysis identified two groups of stakeholder strategies: aggressive strategies and cooperative strategies. Aggressive strategies feature some form of forceful attitude or behavior toward stakeholders in an attempt to alter other stakeholders' behavior. Cooperative strategies feature supportive attitudes or behaviors towards its stakeholders. Models were developed for these two types of stakeholder management strategies. When the level of trust among stakeholders is low, a firm that presses to complete the collaboration activity may choose aggressive strategies in dealing with its trading partners. On the other hand, a sense of interdependence, a perception that its trading partners share the urgency to collaborate, plus awareness that the collaboration activity benefits all will lead the organization to adopt cooperative strategies. Practical implications - By examining the factors contributing to an organization's decision to pursue aggressive (e.g. the radio frequency identification - RFID Mandate), rather than cooperative stakeholder management strategies, this study has important implications to advocates of change (e.g. firms mandating RFID compliance), and firms at the receiving end of aggressive stakeholder strategies. Originality/value - The findings have important implications for advocates of change (e.g. firms mandating RFID compliance). For trading partners to cooperate, the trading partners must be convinced of the urgency of change, that it is appropriate and right to comply with the call for change, and that they have the ability to do it correctly. To firms at the receiving end of aggressive stakeholder strategies, the approach taken by their trading partners may seem like ""bullying tactics"" exercised by firms in a position of power. Instead, this research suggests that firms use aggressive stakeholder management strategies because of a heightened sense of urgency, difficulty in conveying legitimacy in carrying out the collaborative undertaking to the trading partners, and lack of faith that all stakeholders will do their share to make the collaborative undertaking work. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Management theory; Stakeholder analysis; Strategic choices; Supply chain management",

Rather than delineating codes of professional conduct, this text pushes the reader towards an understanding of the nature of ethical dilemmas and the factors that influence the ways in which accountants frame ethical questions. The book is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on developing thinking about the different kinds of ethical questions that could be posed in relation to accounting. The second part focuses more explicitly on accounting practice, exploring the ethical function of accounting in relation to the market economy, ethics in relation to the accounting profession, and the ethics of the international accounting harmonization project.

We suggest that the negative market CSP/CFP relation should not be interpreted as CSP having no value.

Any consideration of paradigm issues in the theoretical business ethics literature is rare and only very occasional references to relevant issues have been made in the empirical journal literature. This is very much the case in the growing fields of cross-cultural business ethics and undergraduate student attitudes, and examples from these fields are used in this article. No typology of the major paradigms available for, or relied upon in, business ethics has been undertaken in the wider journal literature, and this article addresses that gap. It contributes a synthesis of three models of paradigms and a tabulated comparison of ontological, epistemological and methodological assumptions in the context of empirical business ethics research. The author also suggests the likely (and usually unidentified) positivist paradigm assumptions underlying the vast majority of empirical business ethics research published in academic journals and also argues for an increased reliance on less positivist assumptions moving forward. © 2008 Springer science Business Media B.V.","Cross-cultural business ethics; Empirical business ethics research; Epistemologies and methodologies; Ontologies; Paradigm analysis; Paradigm typologies; Undergraduate student attitudes",

It also provides what the author believes to be the key drivers in employer-employee relations and the benefits to good employer-employee relations for each individual within the employment relationship. The results of this research indicate a significant shift in business ethics as it relates to the employers relationship to the employee within a work environment. It further shows the state of the employment relationship prior to World War II. Written contracts were unheard of, but rather, the employment agreement was steeped in a tradition that carried the promise sealed with nothing but a handshake. Now employees have little or no rights; and the ones they are given are provided not by the employer, but by government regulation and court precedent. Issues such as time off for illness, sexual harassment, and workers' compensation are all handled through legal or regulatory means rather than ethical considerations. The research further shows that the distinct lack of leadership within organizations play a significant role in the disintegration of employer-employee relationships. Specifically, how the lack of leadership relates to the emotional intelligence of the leader. Areas such as empathy and social skills are under trained and under developed by organizations. This research shows that the employer who is willing to give employees what they want and need are far more likely to have success, but more importantly, the organizations will be doing the right thing. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accountability; Corporate social responsibility; Empathy; Enthusiastic employee; Ethics; Living wage; Public education; Responsibility; Rewards; Social skill; Togetherness",

This article analyzes recent events connected with the Made in China label from the perspective of evolving Chinese business ethics. Part 1 analyzes three of these events. Part 2 details and analyzes the state of business ethics in China today. Part 3 concludes by exploring the future of business ethics in China.

Numerous contributions argued theoretical frameworks and taxonomies of CSR practices. The authors want to ground in this knowledge and provide further evidence about how companies adopt CSR practices to address stakeholders' claims and consolidate their trust. Evidence was provided by a longitudinal case study about an Italian food company that is one of the largest producers of baby food. This company reshaped its corporate strategy along three decades through the adoption of CSR practices in order to win stakeholders' trust about food safety and supply chain behaviour. The empirical exercise was informed by a literature review of the relevant contributions in terms of CSR business practices and levels of efforts to adopt them. In light of this review, the authors adopted for the research framework the taxonomy of business practices proposed by Spiller (2000, ""Ethical Business and Investment: A Model for Business and Society"", Journal of Business Ethics 27, 149-160) and the levels of commitment towards CSR proposed by Stahl and Grigsby (1997, Strategic Management; Total Quality & Global Competition (Blackwell, Oxford)).

The author presents the results of the research done on the media visibility of companies belonging to the Spanish Stock Exchange in the four most important newspapers in Spain.

In addition, the study also examines if there are systematic differences across countries (Italy and the US) in the decision to address the concerns of various stakeholder groups. Data was collected from 244 managers and 72 companies simultaneously in two different national business contexts, Italy and the US. The results of the study provide some evidence that managerial perception of three stakeholder group characteristics - power, legitimacy, and urgency - form a parsimonious group of variables that explain the process of stakeholder prioritization. However, only limited support was found for the relationship between salience accorded to a stakeholder group and engagement efforts directed toward the group. The results of the study also show that the managerial decision as to which of the stakeholder groups' demands to address will be influenced by society-specific expectations. The significance of this study lies in investigating the stakeholder prioritization and engagement process, as it is being practiced, which, one could argue, would help in developing guidelines for effective stakeholder management that stands a realistic chance of being adapted and followed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated whether the perceived usefulness of the Nigerian VAS conformed to what the managers, as preparers, had envisioned the VAS to accomplish. Using methods pioneered in the empirical literature about the effects of information provision on managers, senior managers in two companies were interviewed about their past, current, and future views concerning the VAS. One company produced a VAS while the other did not produce one even when the Nigerian government made it mandatory. Empirical research about VAS is rare, especially the reasons for nonproduction of a VAS. The collection of interview data at the individual manager level enabled the findings to be compared with various aspects of the VAS literature, including emerging economies, finance studies in the United States, and normative literature in South Africa and UK studies. The non-VAS company respondents strongly considered the government to be the main user, compared with the employees as main users in UK studies. Our findings had some strong support for shareholders as did the United Kingdom. The majority of the VAS-producing respondents noted that a VAS might not be useful to employees, but could be used to measure productivity, demonstrating the function of VAS as a complementary performance indicator. The non-VAS company respondents did not know if a VAS measured productivity, as it was merely a rearrangement of the Income Statement and thus similar to UK views.

I then draw out the implications of the Clash's punk ideology for critical accounting educators today, and especially the implications for ethics education. The Clash's message and moral compass are especially relevant today as (like the Clash's England) both Bush's America and an immediately post-Howard Australia have been vastly altered by a harsh neo-liberalism under which alternative (and especially collectivist) voices have been frequently mocked and suppressed. The Clash was able to simultaneously be both realist and idealist and, whilst this contradiction captured the hearts of many, the classic line-up of the band was to disintegrate under the weight of its own contradictions. The critical accounting community is reminded to continue to aspire to both aspects of the realist/idealist dialectic that is so vividly apparent in the Clash's powerful and poignant early work and especially from the self-titled debut album up to Sandinista! © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, business is like a game, but it is not the equivalent of a game. If business is equated to a game, then the potentially negative implications for ethical content and the application of ethical theories are numerous.

Subsequently, the adoption of codes of ethics has spread throughout the world and they now feature extensively in many organisations. The literature relating to codes of ethics, therefore, spans many decades and is undoubtedly comprehensive. The purpose of the paper is to provide an appropriate anthology of codes of ethics. Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive, historical, anthological approach has been taken. Findings: This paper examines the motivations for the adoption of codes of ethics, which naturally also includes international codes, their frequency of use and content. Codes are also not without critique and it is appropriate to highlight the criticisms of codes, to provide an assessment of their potential effectiveness, the issues surrounding implementation and enforcement and the relationship to organisational culture and leadership.Research limitations/implications: As noted, the literature on codes of conduct is extensive and while effort has been made to capture the key themes the review is not necessarily exhaustive. Originality/value: The literature is characterised by the means of institutionalising ethics in organisations and the paper concludes with a summative reflection on the key dimensions that appear to be paramount for improving the efficacy of codes of conduct. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate governance; Ethics",

Design/methodology/approach: A two-phase methodology is used involving two call centre cases within a call centre group. Phase 1 establishes the need for Six Sigma customer-based measures in addition to internal performance measures and phase 2 studies the implementation of this wider set of Six Sigma performance measures. Findings: The development and application of Six Sigma performance measures that cover both strategic and operational performance measures lead to a more sustainable approach to business improvement, rather than traditional call centre internal performance measures which may be misleading for the overall performance of the call centre. Research limitations/implications: The development of the strategic and operational, or double, DMAIC approach offers opportunities for developing wider applications in service contexts using customer-orientated performance measures. Practical implications: If call centres rely solely on internal performance measures, a misleading picture of call centre performance may be obtained. There is a need to apply Six Sigma to cover both strategic and operational performance measures. Originality/value: A combined strategic and operational approach to Six Sigma has been developed which enables service-based organisations (call centres) to develop sustainable business improvement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business improvement; Call centres; Operations and production management; Performance measures; Six sigma; Strategic evaluation",

Design/methodology/approach: The theory of control behavior was used in this study to understand the different kinds of primary and secondary health-coping strategies used by participants and their impact on intra- and inter-personal empowerments. Using semi-structured interviews, interpretive phenomenology was used to elicit and analyze attitudes and behaviors of Chinese participants' management of MS. Findings: Unlike previous studies which only emphasized the tangible aspects of physical health, the current paper suggests the importance of viewing health benefits in a more holistic manner. It was clear from the Chinese participants that ""disability"" and ""healthy"" were not viewed as two separate concepts. Being healthy does not mean an absence of disease but as role functioning, energy and vitality, social relationships, and emotional well-being. The exploratory paper also found that empowerment outcomes involved an interaction of both the inter- and intra-personal components and, at the same time, were driven by primary and secondary control-related preferences. Research limitations/implications: Future research should include individuals with other disabilities and different demographic and socio-cultural characteristics to confirm the generalizability of the findings uncovered here. Practical implications: The impact of culture and contextual/situational variables on individual's choice of primary and secondary control strategies has important implications for developing health strategies across different ethnic minority groups. Originality/value: The results provide support for the view that there are two dimensions to the process of patient empowerment. Rather than emphasizing primary control strategies, individuals can empower themselves by maintaining a balance between primary and secondary control strategies with respect to their health-related goals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Control theory; Culture; Disabled people; Empowerment; Interpersonal skills; Public health",

E. Freeman has engrossed much of the business ethics literature. Subsequently, some advocates have moved a bit too quickly and without proper definition or argument. They have exceeded Freeman's intentions which are more libertarian and free-market than is often thought. This essay focuses on the versions of stakeholder theory directly authored or coauthored by Freeman in an effort to recover (1) Freeman's intentions and (2) the argumentative justification of stakeholder theory. It then argues that Freeman's appeal to legal, economic, and ethical constraints ultimately produce arguments that are invalid. One can thoroughly support legislation constraining corporations or seeking to prevent age discrimination, market monopolies, and externalities and regret the extent that capitalism is heir to such shortcomings without it following that (1) business beneficiaries should be changed from stockholders to stakeholders and (2) the latter should be given serious decision-making power. Further, stakeholder theory neither defines nor battles any obvious opposition. Hence, it is difficult to see what it changes about business management. In short, stakeholder theory either changes too much about business, or nothing important at all (depending on one's interpretation).

It is the objective of this article to present a perspective on corporate responsibility initiatives based on such a distributed view of agency. By using this framework as an analytical tool, managers and scholars can improve the overall effect of corporate responsibility initiatives by paying more attention to potential incongruence with other practice areas within or beyond their primary domain of influence. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Actor networks; Corporate social responsibility; Distributed agency; Moral landscapes; Science technology studies; Sustainability",

Many researchers have sought to link high levels of Corporate Responsibility with good Corporate Reputations. Yet, the link between these two concepts is not clear and managers do not have much guidance on how they could embrace Corporate Responsibility to enhance Corporate Reputation. One potential reason for the current confusion is that stakeholders have, for the most part, been considered as being homogenous in terms of their expectations of Corporate Responsibility, which means reputational impact is difficult to define. This paper challenges the notion that Corporate Responsibility is an homogenous construct. A latent class model is used to provide evidence that customers and employees of a financial service organisation can be segmented into three groups. This suggests that these groups have different expectations of Corporate Responsibility and as such positive reputation is likely to be driven by meeting these different sets of expectations. The understanding of how Corporate Responsibility impacts on Corporate Reputation is heightened and further implications for the management of reputation and directions for future research are discussed. © 2009 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.","Corporate Responsibility; Latent class analysis; Reputation Management; Stakeholder segmentation",

We find that little in fact has changed between the 1958 and 2008 versions of CR except for the context of (global) business, especially the threat posed by sustainability questions and the more systematic ideological rejection of regulation.

Several scholars have argued that Friedman asserts that businesses have no or minimal social duties beyond compliance with the law. This paper argues that this reading of Friedman does not give adequate weight to some claims that he makes and to their logical extensions. Throughout his article, Friedman emphasizes the values of freedom, respect for law, and duty. The principle that a business professional should not infringe upon the liberty of other members of society can be used by business ethicists to ground a vigorous line of ethical analysis. Any practice, which has a negative externality that requires another party to take a significant loss without consent or compensation, can be seen as unethical. With Friedman's framework, we can see how ethics can be seen as arising from the nature of business practice itself.

Ninety-seven of these companies have some sort of social information on their websites, and 95 of them have formal corporate responsibility reports. Seventy-one of these companies indicate that their reports were based on the G3 guidelines, and 66 of these provide a detailed index to them. The nine G3 HR guidelines can be subdivided into 17 specific items; six of them can be interpreted as requiring only that actions or measures taken be described, and these are widely followed, primarily in the form of policy statements. The remaining items, reported much less frequently, are quantitative, requiring total numbers or percentages of specific actions or incidents, or identification of operations in which such incidents are at significant risk. Thus, although the G3 guidelines for human rights reporting contemplate quantitative statements of performance, most of the reports examined for this article do not provide any, nor, for the most part, indicate why not. I argue that the reporting likely would be more informative if the guidelines were rewritten to request the nature of the processes and procedures the company is implementing for achieving the desired human rights outcomes, and the degree to which they are in place.",,

Also, we wanted to determine what ethics resources are currently available and whether additional resources would be helpful. We conducted a structured telephone interview of all 13 chief executive officers (CEOs) of critical access hospitals in New Hampshire.

On average, the three most frequently noted domains were organizational- professional staff relations, reimbursement, and clinical care. All CEOs indicated they would like to have additional ethics resources to address these conflicts. This study verified that CEOs encounter a broad spectrum of ethical conflicts and need additional ethics resources to address them.

The most common insurance fraud activity and one that contributes a significant portion of dollar losses is the practice of padding claim amounts in the event of a loss. One of the largest issues insurance companies face is that policyholders often do not perceive insurance claim padding as an unethical behavior. However, very little research has examined the factors that contribute to such perceptions. Considering how consumers often attempt to justify fraudulent behavior from a fairness perspective, the present work examines how the amount of the deductible in an insurance claim situation can influence feelings of fairness and ethicality. The results of an experimental study show that higher deductible amounts result in stronger perceptions that insurance claim padding is fair to the insurance company, weaker perceptions that the behavior is unethical, and higher proposed claim award amounts. The study also shows, however, that the deductible amount effects are attenuated for consumers who display higher ethical standards as reflected by their scores on the consumer ethics scale. Implications are discussed with respect to the insurance industry, deviant consumer behavior, and general business ethics theory. © Springer 2008.","Consumer ethics scale; Deviant consumer behavior; Insurance claim padding; Insurance fraud; Perceived risk",

However, few have actually tried to understand and explain it, and even fewer have discussed whether the opposite - standardisation - is possible and desirable. In this article, we take a broader perspective on the issue of the heterogeneity of SRI. We distinguish between four levels on which heterogeneity can be found: the terminological, definitional, strategic and practical. Whilst there is much talk about the definitional ambiguities of SRI, we suggest that there is actually some agreement on the definitional level. There are at least three explanations which we suggest can account for the heterogeneity on the other levels: cultural and ideological differences between different regions, differences in values, norms and ideology between various SRI stakeholders, and the market setting of SRI. Discussing the implications of the three explanations for the SRI market, we suggest that there is reason to be sceptical about the possibilities of standardisation if not standardisation is imposed top-down. Whether this kind of standardisation is desirable or not, we argue, depends on what the motives for it would be. To the extent that standardisation may facilitate the mainstreaming of SRI, it could be a good thing - but we entertain doubts about whether mainstreaming really requires standardisation. © Springer 2008.","Ambiguity; Business ethics; Definitions; Ethical investment; Heterogeneity; Mainstreaming; Responsible investment; Socially responsible investment; Standardisation; Sustainable investment",

Arguments from social contract philosophy and speech act theory lead to consider a communication contract that identifies the necessary individual skills for ethical communication on the basis of a limited number of explicit clauses. These latter are pragmatically binding for all partners involved and help to ensure that the ground rules of cooperative communication are observed within a group or an organization. Beyond promoting ethical communication, the communication contract clarifies how individual discursive behaviour can be constructively and ethically monitored by group leaders in business meetings. A case study which shows what may happen when ground clauses of ethical communication are violated is presented.

The model specifies that sales manager personal moral philosophies, whether sales managers themselves are rewarded according to the outcomes or behaviours of their salespeople, sales team job security, intra-team cooperation, and sales team tactical performance all influence sales team ethical standards. In turn, ethical standards influence the probability that sales team members will behave (un)ethically when faced with ethical dilemmas. Design/methodology/approach - The model is tested on a sample of 154 Finnish sales managers. Data were collected via mail survey. Analysis was undertaken using structural equation modelling. Findings - Ethical standards appear to be shaped by several factors; behaviour-based management controls increase ethical standards, relativist managers tend to manage less ethically-minded sales teams, job insecurity impedes the development of ethical standards, and sales teams' cooperation activity increases ethical standards. Sales teams are less likely to engage in unethical behaviour when the teams have strong ethical standards. Research limitations/implications - Cross-sectional data limits generalisability; single country data may limit the ability to generalise to different sales environments; additional measure development is needed; identification of additional antecedent factors would be beneficial. Practical implications - Sales managers should consciously develop high ethical standards in sales teams if they wish to reduce unethical behaviour. Ethical standards can be improved if sales managers change their own outward behaviour (exhibit a less relativistic ethical philosophy), foster cooperation amongst salespeople, and develop perceptions of job security. How sales managers are rewarded may shape how they approach the management of ethical behaviour in their sales teams. Originality/value - This paper appears to be the first to simultaneously examine both sales manager-specific and sales team-specific antecedents to sales team ethical standards and behaviours. As such, it provides an important base for research in this critical area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Employee behaviour; Sales management; Standards; Team working",

It demonstrates the benefits of viewing external and internal brands synergistically in relation to the value propositions offered to stakeholder groups and the beneficial outcomes that can result from this. Design/methodology/approach - Stakeholder constituencies that can facilitate or constrain marketing effectiveness are identified. The analysis underpins a model that shows links and feedback mechanisms between corporate, external and internal brands; stakeholder evaluation of these; and the implications for stakeholder contribution, loyalty and advocacy. Findings - The paper demonstrates the significance and application potential of a conceptual framework that analyses the relationship between the brand benefits and values that an organisation espouses, how these are experienced by customers and employees, and the implications for marketing and human resource management. Its conclusions have particular significance for services brands where successful customer-organisation relations are dependant on staff commitment that is itself predicated on organisation concern for employee well being. Research limitations/implications - The model provides a framework for further empirical testing of the relationships shown that includes their operation in particular organisation, industry and sector contexts. Practical implications - The paper presents a business based rationale for the marketing function to recognise greater stakeholder concern - especially that of customers and employees - for ethical marketing and sustainability; and the financial, social and ethical capital benefits that can accrue from responding to this. Originality/value - The perspective on branding in the paper recognises the stakeholder management implications of the new marketing paradigm by proposing a holistic approach whereby external and internal brands are viewed synergistically within an integrated marketing strategy.

Using the core elements of Confucianism, the article constructs a notion of a Confucian Firm with its concepts of the moral person (Junzi), core human morality (ren, yi, li) and relationships (guanxi), as well as benign social structure (harmony), articulated in corporate and organizational terms. The basic character of the Confucian Firm is described, and its philosophical and cultural foundation is critically assessed with respect to its moral legitimacy and relevant to today's China. China's recent Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) development is a high profile response to global business ethics concerns. Efforts have been made to emulate and develop good business practice fashioned in CSR norms and visions. The so-called ""human-based"" and ""virtue-based"" business practices rooted in local cultural heritage have been touted as a Chinese response to this problem. This investigation is particularly relevant in the context of the increasingly prominence of the Chinese corporations (China Inc.) in the wake of the rise of China as a global power. How relevant is Confucianism to the building of a modern Chinese corporation that is willing and able to practice reasonable norms of business ethics?

In particular, integrating and extending the resource-based view of the firm and stakeholder management literatures, we develop the arguments that good stakeholder relations not only enable a firm with superior financial performance to sustain its competitive advantage for a longer period of time, but more importantly, also help poorly performing firms to recover from disadvantageous positions more quickly. The arguments are supported by the analysis of a series of first-order autoregressive models. Our findings further suggest that the positive effect of good stakeholder relations on the persistence of superior performance is not as strong as that of some other firm resources, such as technological knowledge, but it is the only factor examined that promises to help a firm recover from inferior performance. Therefore, the role of positive stakeholder relations in helping poorly performing firms recover is found to be more critical than its role in helping superior firms sustain their performance advantage.

They are crucial to expanded development of ethical markets and hence to the addition of moral dimensions to the normally amoral behaviour linking consumers and retail and production businesses. The study reported here attempts to assess the contribution of UK ethical, social and environmental certification and labelling initiatives to 'sustainable' consumption and production. The research sought to assess the overall potential of initiatives to inject human values into the supply-distribution chains, through a qualitative survey of 15 of the 26 main UK initiatives: in social justice, animal welfare and environmental sustainability from the agriculture, food processing, timber, aquaculture, textiles and personal care sectors. By analysing the basic characteristics and concepts of these labels and investigating the emergence of labelling initiatives, we assess whether labels help add an ethical dimension, or whether, in some respects, they also reduce such missions to the technical management of adding only another 'utility' to a product. The analysis assesses whether the gradual 'mainstreaming' of ethical initiatives such as 'Fairtrade' risks subsuming ethical goals within business participants' competitive and profit-oriented logics. However, the contrasting perspectives revealed between rival labelling initiatives show that the scope and functions of labelling projects go beyond the manifest ones of information communication between consumers and producer and actually introduce elements of socio-political regulation. These are essential for more sustainable and ethical business practices and are an integral part of any humanisation of business involvement. © Springer 2009.","Civil society regulation; Corporate responsibility; Ethical business; Ethical labelling; Fairtrade",

This state of harmony relies mainly upon a narrow mandate limiting the endeavour largely to a mapping exercise. It also relies upon a process of 'operationalisation' that is yet to be undertaken despite the recent release of a 4th Report. After a brief presentation of the main parameters of the framework proposed by the 3rd Report and of its precarious advantage over other similar initiatives, this article takes a close look at the main link that needs to be operationalised: i. e. the link between corporate responsibility for human rights and the concept of legal and criminal responsibility. The article then addresses the constitutive elements of the concept of responsibility to shed light upon the responsibility of business organisations in a human rights law context. It looks at the innovative ways in which the concept of corporate criminal responsibility has been dealt with in various domestic jurisdictions and at the new paradigms of corporate agency resulting in the process. Building on this inquiry, the analysis focusses on the way in which the legal discourse acquires new dimensions of corporate responsibility by moving away from an individualistic perspective. On the basis of this, the article suggests conceptual tools that can become instrumental in the process of the operationalisation of the 3rd Report, albeit at the likely cost of rendering the consensus around it more fragile. © Springer 2009.","Business and human rights; Corporate agency; Corporate social responsibility; Human rights; SRSG 3rd report; UN",

Adopting a scholarship of integration approach and evaluating the six studies of communities of organizations, we contribute an inter-organizational network model based on the assumptions about human motives and choice offered by Aristotle. We argue that the sustainability of inter-organizational communities depends on how rich is the set of assumptions about human nature upon which they are based. In order to develop and sustain collaborative capabilities in inter-organizational communities, a set of assumptions that takes both self-regarding and others'-regarding preferences as ends is required to avoid any kind of instrumentalization of collaboration, which is an end in itself.

Fourth, we refer to Ruggie's scholarly work on 'embedded liberalism', the 'global public domain' and 'social constructivism'. Following this, we refer to the other five papers contained in this Journal of Business Ethics special issue, 'Spheres of Influence/Spheres of Responsibility: Multinational Corporations and Human Rights', and consider some of the potential obstacles to Ruggie's recent suggestion that a 'new consensus' has formed, or is forming, around his 'Protect, Respect and Remedy' framework. We conclude by raising questions regarding the processes of consensus-building around, and the operationalisation of, Ruggie's 'Protect, Respect and Remedy' framework. © Springer 2009.","Corporate social responsibility; Embedded liberalism; Global governance; Human rights; International affairs; John Ruggie; Multinational corporations (MNCs); Regulation of markets; Social constructivism; Transnational corporations (TNCs)",

This has meant providing education programs that are funded based on national or State and Territory based policy frameworks, often linked to human capital development. Adult education and training organisations need to be given the chance to 'see' what their local communities need; to 'see' who their targets groups are. Contemporary adult learning programs and practices for regional communities need to encompass a combination of focused and flexible learning processes and resources, including classroom instruction, mentoring, social and cultural activities, community networking and workplace training. There is a need in Australian society to examine all adult education and training sectors in the light of emerging national social inclusion policy frameworks that impact on regional communities. The diverse provision of adult education and training has the capacity to foster social relationships in diverse rural, regional and urban communities.

The second study investigated how the Five Factor Model of personality and position in adversarial networks interacted to influence individuals' performance. Although results of the first study indicated that frequent communication with others could make a person more likeable, consequently helping him or her perform better, the second study showed that those individuals disliked by others were less likely to achieve a good performance rating, despite their conscientiousness, emotional stability, or openness to experiences. © 2009 The Author(s).","Adversarial network; Groups; Peer relationships; Personality; Personhood",

In particular, sustainability and environmental social responsibility reporting, evidence of stakeholder engagement and acknowledgement of societal concerns for corporate identity and reputation management are critiqued from a framework of persuasion and credibility alongside organisational role responsibility. Findings: The findings concurred with current research in corporate communication that documents the significant rise in the use of corporate web sites for the reporting of CSR activities and in corporate attempts to acknowledge and respond to changing local/national and global societal expectations concerning business practices. The automotive industry web sites showed recognition of this increase in societal expectations, projection of a desired corporate identity and the subsequent monitoring of a consistent and accessible communication strategy directed at all stakeholders.

Stakeholders demand greater transparency, more responsible business practices, and the inclusion of stakeholder groups in shaping corporate agendas. A growing focus on sustainability encourages some business houses to prioritize stakeholder feedback in corporate planning, business operations, government affairs, and marketing and community investment. The essence of stakeholder engagement is beginning a dialogue with priority groups to test a business house's assumptions about stakeholder concerns.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors take two perspectives: that of stakeholder engagement, which has historically characterized the debate on CSR; and that of internal change processes required to integrate CSR in a firm's operations. The authors analyze data from 427 interviews, of which 209 were with managers and 219 with stakeholders of 19 multinational firms in eight sectors, to assess the extent of cognitive alignment between managers and stakeholders on the conceptualization of CSR for the relevant firm, to determine which of the two theoretical perspectives is connected with the degree of cognitive alignment, and to determine which of the two is connected with the perception of corporate social performance (CSP). Findings - The data examined show no evidence that the degree of sophistication in stakeholder engagement practices is connected with either the magnitude of cognitive gaps, or the level of CSP; whereas the degree of integration in internal operations is connected with both narrower cognitive gaps and higher CSP. Originality/value - This paper tackles for the first time the problem of measuring and explaining the gaps between managers and stakeholders about their cognitive representations of CSR. The key result of the analysis is that the standard conceptualization of CSR as a stakeholder engagement process does not suffice neither to explain the variation across firms in their managers' cognitive alignment with stakeholders, nor to explain inter-firm variation in social performance. The strongest explanation for both alignment and performance comes from the extent to which the firm has actually invested in internal change processes aimed at integrating the principles of CSR in the operations and strategies of the firm. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Managers; Organizational change; Stakeholder analysis",

By linking the moral claims of an organization's employees to CSR strategies, an organization can strengthen emotional bonds with its key stakeholders, and create deeper, longer-lasting relationships that translate to increased support, loyalty and a sense of stakeholder ownership. Design/methodology/approach - Although there are many definitions of leadership, none of them is universally agreed-upon. The paper reviews different approaches and paradigms of leadership and the role of ethical values in leading responsible organizations. The effective and ethical leadership and the critical role of employees' participation in implementing corporate responsibility agenda are analyzed. Findings - Corporate responsibility strategy will succeed only if employees recognize that this strategy creates value for them as well. In recent times participative leadership is at the center of an important shift in a corporate world increasingly moving away from traditional top-down leadership to more decentralized models based on ethical values shared by all stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - Only a small portion of the existing literature on responsible leadership in the context of CSR reports of studies using longitudinal or empirical designs. Further research should focus on the relationship between different leadership paradigms and corporate social performance. Practical implications - Moral motives carry greater weight in determining the total ""CSR motivation"" held by each employee, so employees will seek to work for, remain in, and get attached to organizations whose organizational strategies are consistent with their moral values. An ethical infrastructure based on the proper leadership model is critical in the process of adopting responsibility-based practices throughout organization. Originality/value - This paper intends to conceptualize the linkage between ethical values of the employees and the type of leadership enhancing implementation of corporate responsibility strategy. Recent discussions among academics and practitioners are showing that effective CSR should be understood more as a process, through which individuals' moral values and concerns are articulated. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Empowerment; Ethics; Leadership; Stockholders",

The design of the survey was based on available literature as well as their own professional experience answering questions commonly received from clients in Latin America. The questionnaire was then applied to a small sample using companies' public information from reports and company web sites.

It seeks to focus on the continuous attention required by competitiveness, and the cultural complexity of renewing business processes in a global environment. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opens by adopting the insecurity context that is clearly reflected in a range of contemporary management and non-management discourses. Among the negative attributes of advanced globalization the authors trace the erosion of trust between society and institutions to perceptions of impropriety by managers in large firms. Reflecting on their extensive joint experience of the corporate responsibility vanguard from the early 1990s, they suggest some interesting themes that will be familiar to governance and CSR academics and practitioners alike. Strands of social, political, economic, cultural and environmental complexity are evident in the narratives. Findings - Perhaps reflecting this decline in trust, the chorus of stakeholders calling for CSR two decades ago has now segued into a demand for sustainable enterprise. But are the dimensions of sustainability any more distinct and measurable than its conceptual antecedent: what is it for a firm to be responsible, accountable, sustainable and transparent? While aspiration can be seen to be running well ahead of capability on such a score in many businesses there are some showing clear leadership in the challenge to be more sustainable.

This is particularly the case when CR provides the basis for the business contribution to sustainable development, which is understood to involve organizational and social innovation leading to change. The paper draws on theoretical and empirical studies to examine leadership for CR as a particular example of management innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops a model of leadership for CR as the business contribution to sustainable development by confronting and integrating the literatures on management innovation and leadership for CR. The proposed model is consistent with the direction, alignment, commitment (DAC) framework that fosters a culture of organizational leadership relevant to the specific case of business and sustainable development. Findings - The process model described in the paper connects leadership in organizational change with literature on management innovation. The paper draws on theoretical and empirically grounded literature on management, corporate responsibility and organizational psychology. It puts forward a sequence of mechanisms that contribute to successful change and discusses how they are linked. This sequence provides a process model of leadership practices for CR as the business contribution to sustainable development viewed as a particular form of management innovation, which involves the advancement of leadership practices for CR as organizational and social change. Research limitations/implications - The model is useful as a reference to practice and as a basis for leadership development. In terms of theory the model needs to be more thoroughly tested in empirical settings to understand better the interdependencies between leadership practices for CR and management innovation.

Design/methodology/approach - Data are collected from 202 college students in Hong Kong at four points in time over a five-month period. Findings - Personality traits (e.g. locus of control and positive affectivity) and interpersonal relationships (e.g. with parents and peers) are related to the intensity of college students' search for their overall identity, positive anticipation of the work role, and level of identification with the student role. These role identification processes, in turn, are related to lower levels of vocational indecision. The results here support the idea that identity variables do serve as mediators of those relationships. Research limitations/implications - A more complete identity approach to studying vocational indecision that focuses on both vocational and non-vocational identities is warranted. Cultural differences in vocational indecision are in need of more research attention, too. Practical implications - In addition to the common practice of assessing the development of students' vocational interests, another way to prepare individuals for the start of their careers is to assess the development of multiple role identities.

Hence, this paper reflects a ITmlange/IT of quality and productivity and sets forth the path to profitable outcomes of quality implementations. Design/methodology/approach - The main approach to the topic is through the basic shop floor understanding of the term quality. The research method used in this paper utilize a range of text books as well as journal paper on quality and total quality management (TQM). Various graphs and figures are very sensibly constructed from the text and well quoted where ever they are inspired from a source. As with the myriad definitions available for quality, this paper starts with the notion of quality as applicable to individuals and hence selected definitions of quality (from quality gurus) have been included. After the basics of TQM have been discussed, the central theme of the paper, i.e. quality and productivity; and its relation is explored. The paper then concludes with a brief account of cost of quality. Findings - The topic is discussed and analysed liberally throughout the length and breadth. Popular findings from this paper include: quality is as important a determining criteria for small businesses as it is for large business houses. And customer's changing demands and the need for stringent cost management in fluctuating environments make TQM a practice of paramount importance for every enterprise, big or small. Practical implications - For sustained business, an optimistic company places customers above profits. The kind of companies that exist in the future will solely be determined by the customers. Hence, to make their businesses customer-centered, the TQM-able approach will be single-handedly successful. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in the grasp of individuals and businesses alike who want to have a holistic view of functions of quality. This paper bridges the gap between two different paradigms of quality and productivity; how they are seen by small- as well as large-scale businesses and how implementing the quality will results in more production and ultimately profitable as well as sustainable businesses reinforced with efficient use of resources available.

And, of course, in 2008, we witnessed the meltdown of financial markets and numerous financial institutions as well as some major companies teetering on the brink of collapse. What is actually needed to create the world that many people want to live in may in fact be a new relationship between business and society, that is, new ways of looking at the corporation and its role in society, both in practice and in management education? We will argue that some initiatives, such as Corporation 2020, have already begun to explore these issues by taking a more holistic perspective on different purposes and roles of the corporation in the future. Management education, which has been severely criticized in the aftermath of the economic crisis, has an important role to play, but in a changed form. Implications for leadership and management education include the need to shift cognitive, moral, and emotional levels of development, renewed emphasis on balance both individually and socially, a less is more sensibility, a holistic systems perspective, and shifting the purpose of the firm to encompass not just shareholder needs, but also societal, stakeholder, and ecological needs and interests.

Design/methodology/approach: CSP is a function of qualitative measures of a firm's Board of Directors, as well as firm risk and financial performance. A longitudinal sample of 104 Canadian firms is used. Findings: Board independence is positively related to social performance but shareholder orientation is not. In addition, a positive relationship between social performance with both financial performance and debt is found. Research limitations/implications: Although the sample is small and restricted to Canadian firms, the results are quite robust. Future studies should consider using qualitative measures on a larger international sample of firms. Originality/value: This paper uses qualitative measures - the degree of independence of the Board and the Board's level of shareholder orientation - to examine the interrelationship between a firm's Board of Directors and its CSP. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Boards of Directors; Canada Paper type Research paper; Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance",

The present study with the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) extends the analysis to the whole spectrum of social issues in management. For this research 41 RGT interviews were conducted in Belgium with top experts and CEOs of the Belgian economy and civil society. Research Findings/Results: Both authorities and CEOs pragmatically and rather clearly differentiate the various concepts related to corporate governance, CSR, and business ethics. Our findings partially reject the confusion in terminology noticed in recent academic literature and in corporate communication, emphasizing increased vagueness and overlapping of the concepts around corporate governance, CSR, and business ethics. Theoretical Implications: While CSR is seen as the best candidate for an umbrella term, no unified paradigm has yet to be achieved in the business and social field. Three basic concepts of corporate responsibility, corporate governance, and business ethics emerge as being complementary. Corporate governance has acquired an important place in the hierarchy of business and society concepts. Practical Implications: Corporations cannot restrict their actions and communication regarding social issues in management to one single domain. Several complementary issues have to be addressed simultaneously.

Unfortunately, corporate governance, regulation and accounting have played a prominent role in business failure for the past decade resulting in a growing lack of public confidence in our markets. We present a new model that contributes to improving the quality of corporate information by providing not more, but better information through increased intelligibility of overall information, benefiting both the firm and its broad array of stakeholders. It has become apparent that boards, management and regulators have been unable to cope with the rise of business failures by adding increasing layers of regulation that have often served only to exacerbate the complexity and further cloud the transparency of needed information. We have identified a growing number of forward-thinking firms that have found alternative means to provide betterinformation and strengthen their companies. We offer a stakeholder-centric model for improving information intelligibility based upon the extensive scope and variety of external input derived from the growing social movement organizations. With the added focus on intelligibility, these groups can help foster greater corporate responsibility, meaningful transparency, increased stakeholder benefits, and improved overall performance of the firm. © 2009 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College.",,

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on a case study that includes interviews with ten managers and survey data from 149 manager respondents. Findings - The paper concludes that managerial perceptions of CSR are characterised by a great deal of heterogeneity. It shows that, even in an organisation with a long CSR tradition and formalised CSR policies, standards and procedures, managers hold different, and not necessarily convergent, views of CSR.

The article moves to looking at the status of sites in terms of property rights, drawing on Locke's original formulation.

Using the insights developed by Hirschman, I would like to show how one must first expose the rhetoric of those critics of change (referred to below as conservatives or reactionaries) in order then to implement that which is new (representatives of this approach are referred to below as progressives). Such an 'unmasking' works particularly well when one can defuse the arguments of the reactionaries - which is precisely what one achieves by strategically integrating ethics into economics. In his work The Rhetoric of Reaction Hirschman examines three basic forms of reactionary thought: the perversity thesis, the futility thesis, and the jeopardy thesis. According to the perversity thesis, intended goals are transformed into their opposites. The futility thesis argues that the setting of goals is useless since history runs its own course independent of those goals. The jeopardy thesis claims to preserve what already exists since change might substantially endanger that which has already been achieved. The importance of Hirschman's ideas for the strategic interplay between the academic disciplines can be seen quite clearly in the example of German business ethics. This will be displayed below with reference to Hirschman's three theses. Finally, implications will be drawn for business ethics in general and for management theory in particular. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Albert O.

Good business ethics are not founded on compliance with laws or regulations, but on generosity of spirit. Ethical business behavior does not disallows acting in one's self interest, but means that the latter outcome is not the primary motive for the actions that achieve it. A sense of ethics demands recognition of the needs of others, which is reflected in the treatment of staff and involvement in the community.

Nonetheless, as recent corporate scandals have shown, a whole range of financial professionals (accountants, auditors, bankers, finance directors) can collectively fail to question dubious actions. How is this possible? To understand such failures, this book explores how accountants construct the technical knowledge they deem relevant to decision-making. In doing so, it not only offers a new way to understand deviance and scandals, but also suggests a reappraisal of accounting knowledge which has important implications for everyday commercial life. The book's findings are based on interviews with chartered accountants working in the largest accountancy practices in London. The interviews reveal that although accounting decisions seem clear after they have been made, the process of making them is contested and opaque. Yet accountants nonetheless tend to describe their work as if it were straightforward and technical. This book delves beneath the surface to explore how accountants actually construct knowledge, and draws out the implications of that process with respect to issues such as professionalism, performance, transparency, and ethics. This thought-provoking book concludes that accountants' technical discourse undermines their ethical reasoning by obscuring the ways in which accounting decisions must be thought through in practice. Accountants with particular ethical perspectives more readily understand and construct particular types of knowledge, so the two issues of knowledge and of ethics are inseparable. Increasingly technical accounting rules can therefore be counterproductive. Instead, this book shows how reinvigorating the ethical discourse within the financial world could be a more effective means of averting future scandals. © Matthew Gill, 2009.

Because there are spillover benefits of being associated with a ""winner,"" the perceptions of stakeholders and potential stakeholders can affect firm value. Our analysis indicates that while transparency (i.e., generating information about a firm's quality) may improve the allocation of resources, a firm may have a higher ex ante value if information about its quality is not prematurely generated. Transparency costs arise because of asymmetric information regarding the extent to which stakeholders benefit from having a relationship with a high-quality firm. These costs are higher when firms can undertake noncontractible innovative investments that enhance the value of their stakeholder relationships.

This study employs both qualitative and quantitative methods, consisting largely of online and textual research, convenient and confidential telephone interviews, content analysis of government communication materials, and intercept surveys in Beijing (China's capital city) and Chengdu (the provincial capital of the Sichuan Province where the earthquake hits). The study finds that the institutionalization of government public relations in China has visible results, especially, in the areas of crisis communication and management, as well as stakeholder-relationship building.

The contributors were asked to consider the renaissance in the British economy during the closing decades of the 20th century. In doing so they were also asked to reconsider the debates and assertions relating to relative economic decline in Britain since the end of the 19th century. Chapters range across the economy, from banking, retail, high technology and staple industries, transport, to sports and leisure industries. In addition, key themes such as foreign investment, government policy, managerial characteristics, marketing, business, ethics, and so on have their own chapters. What emerges is a picture of complexity and reappraisal bringing into question the accuracy or applicability of much of the writing and axioms surrounding British business in the 20th century. Both the nature of economic recovery, the depth and periodization of relative decline clearly do not stand up to scrutiny. If nothing else the book disposes with the notion that a simple re-injection of market forces ideology in the 1980s changed and modernised the British economy. The book has identified both a need for a broad reappraisal to take into account the complexity underlying ideas of renaissance in the late 20th century, in addition to a need to reject unicausal explanations for the fate and possibilities of the British economy in the 21st century. © Oxford University Press, 2009.

Others subscribe to the theory that, realistically, less ethical means are necessary. This article contains an analysis of these perspectives drawing on observations from evolutionary game theory and nature. Based on these analyses, it is concluded that the financial returns of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility (CSR and CSI) are equal on average. The explanation is that CSR and CSI aredriven to a state of equilibrium, because if one or the other were to offer higher profits, it would attract more players who would compete for the best opportunities until there was no difference in average profit. Existing empirical research generally shows a positive correlation between CSR as measured and corporate financial performance. It is argued that what is actually causing that finding is probably not CSR but management skill. More skillful managers, whether actually responsible or irresponsible, are able to obtain both higher profits and greater credit in imperfect measures of CSR. Next it is shown that this theory of equal returns implies greater moral freedom and therefore responsibility for business leaders. It is concluded that this insight can intensify the interest of decent business leaders in vigorously championing CSR. © 2009 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College.",,

It first summarizes three related aspects of Simmel's approach to social action that are relevant to organizational research: his method of using 'pure types' for describing social roles; positions for locating social actors in relation to each other; and structure for describing recurring social relationships. It then examines Simmel's applications of these ideas to social groupings of increasing complexity beginning with simple social interactions consisting of a monad, dyad, and triad; pyramidal hierarchies of dominant and subordinate relations; and finally, overlapping and interacting affiliations. The article continually draws parallels between Simmel's conceptual ideas and how they relate to critical topics in organizational behavior and to the larger social context. The article concludes by suggesting that Simmel may be even more relevant to a post-industrial age than he was to the machine age in which bureaucracy dominated, which might account for his relative neglect in the past and possible re-emergence today. © Oxford University Press, 2009.

Shared occupational identities provide a foundation for the recognition of common economic interests. Consequently, occupational membership can serve as an important basis for collective action that is aimed at defining both material and social relationships within organizations. Such action may be directly focused on employing organizations, targeted at enhancing occupational members' control of work and setting terms of exchange. Alternatively, collective action may focus on the broader political economy, seeking to secure the interests of occupational members by persuading the public that members have unique, specialized knowledge that is needed to carry out certain tasks. Such recognition provides the basis for the creation of licensing and other market closure arrangements that may broadly affect the economic situation of an occupational group. © Ackroyd 2005.

Design/methodology/approach Theory on the creation of social capital and consequent intellectual capital between parties to collaborative project procurement is explored. This is an exploratory study using grounded theory. Findings A proposed capability maturity model (CMM) is posited that can be used to measure improvement in developing human social capital, and assisting in project strategy formulation. Two recent Australian alliance projects are analysed using the model to gain insights into how the quality of relationships within project alliances can be assessed. Practical implications The model described in this paper may be used to measure performance or as an initial step towards strategising a change management plan based upon identifying a ""current"" situation. Originality/value Each alliance is unique and so its goals with regard to social capital will vary. Accordingly the results should be viewed accordingly. Work in this area using a CMM approach is relatively rare, and so this paper provides a novel way of measuring a complex concept such as social capital.

No longer is the emergence of imitation products confined to branded luxury goods and final markets. Counterfeit articles are increasingly finding their way into other sectors, including the fast-moving consumer goods, pharmaceutical, and automotive industries - with, in part, severe negative consequences for consumers, licit manufacturers, and brand owners alike. This paper seeks to shed light on the economic principles of counterfeit trade and the underlying illicit supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive literature review was conducted that comprised contributions from different strands of management research. Findings: Though governments as well as management have clearly identified the problem, very little is known - both in practice and theory - about the mechanisms and structure of the illicit market, the tactics of counterfeit producers, consumer behavior with respect to imitation products and the financial impact on individual companies. The diversity of the counterfeit phenomenon underlines the need for further research in this area and the development of company-specific measures for fighting product piracy. Research limitations/implications: The clandestine nature of the counterfeit market limits direct accessibility to the phenomenon. Consequently, the existing body of literature does not necessarily cover all aspects of counterfeit activities. The review helps to highlight existing research gaps but may not be able to identify additional aspects of the phenomenon that, thus far, have not been deemed relevant. Originality/value: The paper critically reviews the current state of research across different management-related disciplines. From an academic perspective it may serve as a starting point for a future research agenda that addresses the current knowledge gaps. From a practitioner's perspective it is helpful for understanding the relevant influence factors and for developing appropriate, state-of-the-art counterstrategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Counterfeiting; Supply and demand; Trade",

Design/methodology/approach - Based on a review of previous literature, the aspects of a CSR activity and the contrasting objectives that may influence consumers' responses are discussed. Several propositions are put forward. Findings - The structure of a CSR activity, mainly including type of issue/cause, its form, timing and commitment, leads to consumers' different attributions, which in turn leads to consumers' different responses to the firm. Also, consumers make attributions about a firm's CSR activity in terms of the contrast effect between the firm's corporate social performance (CSP) and other objectives for reference, such as the firm's CSR ability, its past CSP, its negative social impact of operation and other firms' CSR activities. Moreover, even though consumers can make positive attribution to a firm's CSR activity, the significant contrast effect of it against the objectives might also lead to consumers making negative responses. Research limitations/implications - Given the complex psychological processes of consumers, it is not known if there are other components of a CSR activity and other contrasting objectives that might influence consumers' responses. Originality/value - The paper helps business managers to realize the risks embedded in CSR activities, and helps them to use CSR strategically to promote business goals by carefully considering the mix of components of CSR activity and the fit with other contrasting objectives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business policy; Consumer behaviour; Consumer research; Corporate social responsibility",

The authors aim to highlight and identify current practices, particularities, and challenges in disaster relief supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Both SCM and logistics management literature and examples drawn from real-life cases inform the development of the theoretical model. Findings: The theoretical, dual-cycle model that focuses on the key missions of disaster relief agencies: first, prevention and planning and, second, response and recovery. Three major contributions are offered: a concise representation of current practices and particularities of disaster relief supply chains compared with commercial SCM; challenges and barriers to the development of more efficient SCM practices, classified into learning, strategising, and coordinating and measurement issues; and a simple, functional model for understanding how collaborations between corporations and disaster relief agencies might help relief agencies meet SCM challenges. Research limitations/implications: The study does not address culture-clash related considerations. Rather than representing the entire scope of real-life situations and practices, the analysis relies on key assumptions to help conceptualise collaborative paths. Practical implications: The study provides specific insights into how corporations might help improve the SCM practices by disaster relief agencies that continue to function without SCM professional expertise, tools, or staff. Originality/value: The paper shows that sharing supply chain and logistics expertise, technology, and infrastructure with relief agencies could be a way for corporations to demonstrate their good corporate citizenship.

It examines the notion of a profession and argues for a position that recognises both the potential benefits of professionalisation and the self-serving tendencies to which professions can be prone. Such a position entails a view that the outcome of professionalisation for society is a contingent matter rather than an inevitability (whether positive or negative) and therefore something that is worth attempting to influence. In developing the argument, two major areas from the business ethics/corporate social responsibility literature, oriented towards business enterprises but also of relevance to professional bodies, are reviewed: whether being ethical 'pays' in financial terms; and whether formal codes are useful in promoting ethical behaviour. The paper concludes by positing three models of the professional body and contending for a renewed notion of membership if professional bodies are to function as effective 'moral communities'.","Codes of ethics; Moral community; Professional bodies; Professional ethics; Professions",

All these models take their origins in the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA, Ajzen & Fishbein, 1975) and in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB, Ajzen, 1980) which are classical models for predicting new behavior. In the TPB and TRA, the most important predictor of behavior is behavioral intention and Intention is predicted by attitude, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms. We find all this determinants in acceptance models. In our point of view, the influence of norms is largely neglected. In fact, researches often just consider the individual acceptance (e.g., utility and utilisability). The importance of norms or social context is now recognized in social psychology. In this paper we try to underline how norms and social context can contribute to knowledge about user acceptance technology. Our project aims to bring psychosocial contribution to the question of acceptance. According to Doise (1982), when studying an object, social psychology research might follow four levels of analyses : 1/the intra-individual level (explaining behavior in terms of how people organize knowledge and experiences in their mind) ; 2/the inter-individual level (explanation of behave in terms of social relationships) ; 3/« positional» level (explanations are found in social status) ; and 4/ideological level (understanding behavior in terms of culture, social values).

The key findings are two-fold: first, employees' values were positively correlated with attitudes toward the environment, which also correlates with perceived corporate citizenship; second, the ownership type of the firm had a significant influence on corporate citizenship, employee values and their attitudes toward environment. Contrary to existing beliefs, Stateowned enterprises in China have much poorer ratings on all the three constructs compared to privately owned companies.

The aim of the article is not so much as to evaluate the different single decisions that were made and implemented to make the company meet high ethical standards, but rather to focus on three issues and on how they relate to each other: (1) the shift from a communitarian Christian set of values to a broader secular framework of basic principles; (2) the way in which business people in a retailing company cope with issues that seem ethically troublesome, when reflected upon from a ethical point of view; and (3) how the process of ethical dialogue has led to a typology of the different levels of responsibility that retailers are willing to attribute to themselves according to the kind of problem at stake.

Organizations may find corrupt acts in its operations or practices, but specific concepts and programs to avoid them are neither concrete nor clear. Some Brazilian stockholders have become aware of the risks involved in unethical procedures and are adopting the Best Practices of Corporate Governance initiative. International agencies have intensively supported organizations and governments in an effort to define policies that inhibit illegal or corrupt cultural habits throughout the world, but Brazilian practitioners show insufficient response. Skepticism may indicate a lack of understanding about how an ethical leadership can guide employees, setting high standards for the organizational culture and climate, clearly defining limits of correct behavior, and creating appropriate codes of ethics. Transparency still has to be discovered as a significant tool to encourage professionalism in performance and reporting of data in Brazilian companies. In this article, we analyze the ethical behavior of the purchasing department of a multinational company in its host country, Brazil. It focuses specifically on the supplier- buyer relationship. The results indicate that despite the negative reputation Brazilians have in business ethics, a company can still develop a positive and ethical relationship with its stakeholders. Communication, transparency, compliance with the company's code of conduct as well as the supplier's awareness of the buyer's code of conduct are the factors which influence the supplier- buyer relationship. Transparency can be used as a tool to reduce corruption, thereby increasing ethical behavior and company image. Good ethical behavior can help to build up a company's image. © Springer 2009.","Code of ethics; Compliance; Corporate governance; Corruption; Ethics in developing countries; Supplier-buyer relationship; Transparency",

It is argued that its notion we encounter is often very simple (as in making money) or extremely vague (as in adding value). In the first section Need for a fresh look at the creation of wealth, the need for a fresh look is highlighted by pointing to three concerns about globalization and the roles and responsibilities of corporations. In the second section Conceptual clarifications: what is the creation of wealth?, a rich concept of wealth creation is developed that includes physical, financial, human, and social capital, encompasses private and public wealth, accounts for its production and distribution, recognizes its material and spiritual side, and places wealth in the time horizon of sustainability. Moreover, creating (wealth) as making something new and better is distinguished from possessing and acquiring, and different motivations required for wealth creation are explored.

Stakeholder approach in the organization integrates stakeholder relationships within a company's resource base, industry setting, and sociopolitical arena into a single analytical framework. The key relationships for a business go far beyond the relationships with its customers and include the relationships with its employees, as well as those with suppliers and partners, investors and market analysts, and even government regulators, trade associations and other entities that influence the general business climate in which a given business operates. In all cases stakeholders are inseparable part of management strategy. This concept helps people and organizations to agree upon joint goals, participation, boundaries and benefit, i.e. flexibly to plan the activity. Organizations generate intellectual, environmental, and social capital in addition to financial capital. In successful organizations, the three core elements of strategy, structure, and culture are aligned and respond to external forces and changing expectations. The relationships among core elements are dynamic and adaptive, both in relation to each other and in relation to the overall fit between the organization and its environment. A comprehensive orientation toward stakeholder management penetrates the core of the organization; in the redefined organization, all the three elements and their alignment reflects the underlying humanistic commitment to the organization's stakeholders. A clear demonstration that management possesses and intends to implement a compelling vision of the enterprise - who we are, and what we stand for - provides the essential foundation for effective stakeholder management. Organization-stakeholder relations lead to new ideas about the responsibilities of organizations, the role of managers, and the most appropriate management style. Seeing organizations and their relationship with stakeholders from a systems perspective helps us understand that organizations, as organic systems, undergo self- regulation and renewal through interactions with diverse parts of their environment. The more dynamic view of organization-stakeholder relations acknowledges the interdependence that exists between companies and their stakeholders and asserts that stakeholder relationships can be a source of opportunity and competitive advantage rather than simply threat or drain on organizational resources. However, for most companies, the attention of management has been focused on one stakeholder group at a time. Collaborative approaches are often confined to specific parts of an organization. Rare is the company that adopts a comprehensive and strategic approach to relationship building that is governed both by deep social values and by recognition of the bottom line.","Balanced scorecard; Intangible assets; Organization competitiveness; Organization's wealth; Stakeholder relationships",

A subsequent examination of comparable themes published in the Journal of Business Ethics (JBE) is performed to establish commonalities and gaps on the topic of IB ethics between the leading IB journals and the leading business ethics journal. Design/methodology/approach- A total of 42 articles are identified in JIBS, JWB and MIR that are deemed IB ethics research, and 62 articles in JBE over the same timeframe. A content analysis of these articles is conducted. Findings- The main thematic clusters in the three IB journals are ethical judgment analyses, violation of laws and regulations, national moral environments, and corporate governance. Codes of ethics are an underlying issue across many of these themes but this is not explicitly studied. Articles published in JBE show a wider range of themes than those published in the three IB journals. Research limitations/implications- A broader selection of business ethics journals and of leading management journals that do not focus exclusively on IB could have produced additional important themes. Even so, there is an opportunity for IB ethics research to get into as yet unexamined important themes. Practical implications- The ethical themes identified can help managers in their efforts to deliver focused and clustered ethical training.

This study develops a theoretical framework that predicts (1) the impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on firm-idiosyncratic risk and (2) the role of two strategic marketing levers, advertising and research and development (R&D), in explaining the variability of this impact among different firms. The results show that higher CSP lowers undesirable firm-idiosyncratic risk. Notably, although the salutary impact of CSP is greater in firms with higher (versus lower) advertising, a simultaneous pursuit for CSP, advertising, and R&D is harmful with increased firm-idiosyncratic risk. For theory, the authors advance the literature on the marketing-finance interface by drawing attention to the risk-reduction potential of CSP and by shedding new light on some critical but neglected roles of strategic marketing levers. They also extend CSP research by moving away from the long-fought battle for a universal CSP impact and toward a finer-grained understanding of when some firms derive more risk-reduction benefits from CSP. For practice, the results indicate that the ""goodwill refund"" of CSP is not unconditional. They also empower marketers to communicate more effectively with investors (i.e., doing good to better manage the risk surrounding firm stock prices). © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Advertising; Corporate social responsibility; Marketing-finance interface; Research and development; Stock risk",

These metrics do not provide the necessary level of detail for managers who want to establish an optimal level of CSP investment for their company.

Second, covert observations were used to record what people actually drink to understand whether alcohol is always enjoyed responsibly. Taken together, the results suggest many adults are not adequately informed and many Australian adults do not enjoy alcohol responsibly. A more rigorous social responsibility approach may be warranted. To achieve sustained behavioural change companies need to move towards corporate social performance (CSP). CSP requires CSR interventions to be evaluated to determine their contribution towards real social gains. CSR is not enough to reach the social goals required by society.

Concerning procedural justice, we will discuss how firms involve stakeholders in their strategic processes according to their contribution to wealth creation.

In theory, outside directors are in a better position than insiders to protect and further the interests of all stakeholders because of their experience and their sense of moral and legal obligations. Female directors also tend to be more sensitive to ethics according to several past studies which explain this affirmation by early gender socialization, the fact that women are thought to place a greater emphasis on harmonious relations and the fact that men and women use different ethical frameworks in their judgments. The goal of this paper is to determine the influence of these characteristics of the Board in terms of promoting and hindering the creation of a code of ethics. Our findings show that a greater number of female directors does not necessarily lead to more ethical companies. Moreover, within Europe as a continent, board ownership leads to an entrenchment of upper-level management, generating a divergence between the ethical interests of owners and managers.

Study 1 indicates that a proactive communication strategy (when the firm's CSR statements precede conflicting observed behavior) leads to higher levels of perceived hypocrisy than a reactive strategy (when the firm's CSR statements follow observed behavior). The inconsistent information in both scenarios increases perceptions of hypocrisy, such that CSR statements can actually be counterproductive. Study 1 also reveals how perceived hypocrisy damages consumers' attitudes toward firms by negatively affecting CSR beliefs and provides evidence for the mediating role of hypocrisy during information processing. Study 2 finds that varying CSR policy statement abstractness acts to reduce the hidden risk of proactive communication strategies and can improve the effectiveness of a reactive strategy.

As a consequence of this critique, the concept of a practice-based 'ethics of responsiveness' in which ethics is never final but rather always 'to come', is investigated. In such an approach the ethical self is understood as being continuously constituted within power/knowledge relations.

We argue that the use of CT allows for a theoretically more sophisticated treatment of culture in ethical decision making and thus the avoidance of some common problems with existing cross-cultural studies of business ethics. In our discussion, we raise questions about the compatibility between management systems and processes created in one context and ethical behaviours in another. © Springer 2009.","Code of ethics; Culture and ethics; Douglasian Cultural Theory; Methodological individualism; Shareholder approach; Stakeholder approach",

Design/methodology/approach - Various definitions of both public relations and strategic public relations were cited in the paper and the common terms used in all definitions were outlined. The main discussion was then based on such similarities in order to establish the differences between the two terms. This was done by studying others' research and discussing their findings in a simple language in order to present a reliable literature review to readers and facilitate future research by providing credible references. Findings - There is a grey line between public relations and strategic public relations; however there are differences between the two. This paper clarifies the differences by referring to genuine definitions of the two terms by experts and their analysis of the terms when it comes to practice, which calls for integration. Research limitations/implications - There is limited research conducted in the field of strategic public relations and still many have doubts about its effectiveness. This paper gathered relevant theory and examples from the real business world to suggest integration of public relations with marketing tools with strategic management coupled with generating trust. Practical implications - Symmetrical communications and realising appropriate timing are important to achieve objectives of strategic pubic relations. There is no magic or formula for this but to think outside the box, allow effective stakeholders' engagement and proactive monitoring of the marketplace to increasingly enhance the chances of success. Originality/value - Succinct study of strategic public relations and introducing the term SPR, as well as emphasising the integration of appropriate techniques and tools to achieve optimal result. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Public relations; Strategic management",

The issues that have received most attention are whether executives' pay is fair and justified by performance. Since more recent studies show that stock options grants constitute the single largest component in executive compensation, we examine the relations of these grants to economic determinants and corporate governance for firms in the stagnant stage of their lifecycle. We find that, on average, stock options grants comprise a significant portion of annual CEO compensation (26.4%) for stagnant firms. We also find that economic (corporate governance) factors explain less (or more) of the cross-sectional variation in stock options grants for stagnant firms than for growth firms. Furthermore, we document lower pay-performance sensitivity (i.e., weaker incentive alignment) and no improvement in future firm performance from past stock options grants to CEOs of stagnant firms. In particular, our study provides empirical evidence on some inefficiencies associated with stock options grants to CEOs of low potential (stagnant) firms, a long-standing concern of business ethics researchers (Moriarty, 2005; Nichols and Subramaniam, 2001; Perel, 2003). Our results also provide support for the corporate governance reforms discussed in Matsumura and Shin (2005), especially those proposed provisions that curtail the power of CEOs in the governance of firms. © Springer 2009.","Business ethics; Economic determinants; Executive compensation; Life cycle; Payperformance sensitivity; Stock options",

Based on the analysis of qualitative case study data, we argue that the active role of employees pressuring for CCI policies and practices, as well as the organization audience responses to their efforts, are at the core of the challenges involved in managing CCI.

In close parallel to these changes are differences in interpretation from Anglo- American and Continental European perspectives.The author defends that the ultimate reasons behind these differences are of a philosophical nature, affecting both the anthropology and the political theory dominant in each of these cultures. Philosophically, anglo-american culture may be described as individualistic, legalistic, pragmatist and with an understanding of rights as freedom from state intervention. Continental European culture, on the other hand, is more community-oriented, more dependent on unwritten laws or customs, less resultsdriven or more appreciative of the intrinsic value of activities and with an understanding of rights as freedom to participate in social goods and decisions. In the end, a twist is introduced in the meaning of corporate citizenship: beyond referring to the firm as a citizen of the state, it now signifies and analyzes the rights and responsibilities of the different ""citizens"" comprising the corporate polity.

According to the horizon problem hypothesis, retiring CEOs may reduce expenditure in long-term investments. Since investing in social responsibility-related areas tends not to have an immediate impact on firm performance, I expect that retiring CEOs may reduce expenditure in social responsibility-related areas. In this paper, in addition to examining the occurrence of the horizon problem in the new context of CSP, I evaluate the behavioral assumption behind this opportunistic CEO behavior. While previous research generally assumes that the primary motivation behind this opportunistic CEO behavior is the compensation maximization at retirement, my finding suggests that CEO's concern about postretirement career may be more attributable. In further support of the post-retirement career concern argument, the result shows that providing CEO with a post-retirement job opportunity as a director of the board mitigates the negative impact of CEO retirement on CSP. In contrast, granting long-term compensation (e.g. stock option) to CEOs, which has been considered a primary solution of the horizon problem, is found not to have a statistically significant mitigating effect on the negative relationship between CEO retirement and CSP.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Horizon problem","Behavioral assumption; Career concern; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Firm Performance; Horizon problem; Job opportunities; Long-term investment; Mitigating effects; Social performance; Stock options; Industry"

The first is the horizontal expansion of the agenda: each one of these literatures and practice communities has seen their theme agenda expand systematically over the past few years. The relationship between the company and its socio-environmental context is increasingly richer and multifaceted, to the point that it would be unthinkable nowadays to ignore (or reverse) this interdependent connection. The second trend is the deepening of the thematic agendas of the B&S family, bringing them closer to the core of public, private and social organizations' strategies.

Adam Smith has been brought into the discipline to show that his authority cannot be summoned to fully support the free market sceptics of business ethics. Little has been done, however, to illustrate that Smith's moral writings actually contain the fundamentals of a business ethics teaching for managers who necessarily work within a variety of networks. This article analyses his moral thought to infer a Smithean framework of business ethics for managers. Smith believes that self-interest should be subordinated to moral imperatives, even in the business world. However, Smith rejects the principles of corporate social responsibility on the argument that benevolent impulses cannot be expected to prevail in the commercial arena. Instead of consciously trying to advance the social good, Smith's ideal manager will endeavour to personally live up to the standards enforced by an impartial spectator of his conduct, a theoretical entity reflecting the ethical requirements posed by the manager's social networks and stakeholder relationships. While this internalized onlooker expects a limited degree of benevolence, the overriding demand is for the manager to abide by the dictums of justice and prudence. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adam Smith; business ethics; corporate social responsibility; network ethics; self-interest; social networks; virtue",

Even if we're not always sure exactly what they mean, terms such as corporate identity, corporate governance and corporate finance have entered normal business parlance. They have rapidly been followed by corporate responsibility, corporate education, corporate integrity, corporate citizenship, corporate credibility, corporate branding, corporate education, corporate success, corporate strategy, and so on. The list could go on indefinitely. All these buzzwords relate closely to the discussion that has flared up surrounding corporate goals - or, to be more precise, the goals of corporate entrepreneurs. An unhealthy fixation on shareholder value as the sole measure of corporate performance has intensified the conflict between shareholders and other stakeholders. A fundamental debate is raging - and not for the first time - over what entrepreneurial goals companies could and should set themselves. This discussion is far from over. It is already clear, however, that entrepreneurs must shoulder greater responsibility. Society evidently wants top managers to assume responsibility toward the economy as a whole, society and the environment. The corporate egocentrism that has apparently prevailed hitherto is thus giving way to a kind of universal responsibility toward everyone and everything that is deemed to be in need of protection.

Ethical behavior offers good reputation, credibility and tradition to the corporation. It leads to corporate social, environmental and economic responsibilities, cooperating to the desired sustainability. This paper analyzes the inversion of values that corporate governance systems have suffered. The meaning and implication of the corporate social responsibility is investigated and discussed. A pyramid of values is built upon individual ethical values at the basis. Over them, the organizational ethical values should indicate the limits of operations, so that the corporate social responsibility can be sustained, in the top. The authors comment that ethical values no longer lead the organization. Its communication with the stakeholders, specifically through reports, has been gradually replacing the code of ethics and corporate values. These reports have taken the basis of the pyramid leading the organizations to socially irresponsible and unethical behavior. They do not guarantee transparency or communicate the needs of the society. It appears that transnational companies do not behave the same way in their home country as they do in host countries, particularly in less developed regions like Latin America and Africa. Lack of communication and transparency may induce employees to unethical decisions and transform the reporting system into a marketing instrument. In order to guarantee compliance with the codes, transparency and ethical responsibility, communication within the organization is essential. © Springer 2010.","Business ethics; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability; Transnational corporations; Transparency",

A questionnaire instrument containing these 15 CSFs was sent out to project managers in Hong Kong, and 183 completed questionnaires were retrieved. The top three ranked factors for stakeholder management were ""managing stakeholders with social responsibilities"", ""assessing the stakeholders' needs and constraints to the project"", and ""communicating with stakeholders properly and frequently"". Using factor analysis and considering the high importance of the factor ""managing stakeholders with social responsibilities"", the 15 CSFs were grouped into five dimensions namely, precondition factor, stakeholder estimation, information inputs, decision making, and sustainable support. All these five groupings and their relationship were included in a framework for successful stakeholder management in construction projects.

Compliance levels can be used as an indicator for the (expected) output/outcome effectiveness of the Compact. First, an analysis of ""old"" members that joined the Compact before 2006 is presented. Second, based on a series of Kaplan-Meier estimates drawn from the historic analysis, a forecasting analysis is applied to identify trends among ""new"" members that entered the Compact from January 2006.

It questions the origins and dynamics of norms from a sociological perspective, and identifies a tension between prescriptive efforts to make norms obligatory and positivist accounts that describe norms as evolving and unstable. In the presence of dynamic and incomplete norms, managers can either deliberate with stakeholders to make norms flexible or codify norms to make them rigid.

As an implicit construct values are inherent to any communication. Accordingly, a framework is developed that conceptualizes value-oriented teaching as a communication system covering aims, content, styles, media, and structures of communication. The design of these elements is geared towards two possible goals of value-oriented teaching: transferring specific values and conveying moral competence. The developed framework of communicative elements may serve business school managers and management professors as a guide for designing a value-oriented curriculum.","Teaching business ethics; Teaching theory; Value oriented teaching","Business curricula; Business ethics; Business schools; Educational institutions; Social behavior; Specific values; Communication systems; Curricula; Management; Managers; Personnel training; Philosophical aspects"

This work includes Professors Fort's and Schipani's arguments about how business may be able to play a role in promoting more peaceful societies, and other research addressing how businesses might serve a role in reducing violence in society and the workplace. Although there is a significant body of scholarship on the role of business in reducing violence in society, there is little research on concrete steps for businesses to take to achieve this goal. This article attempts to begin to fill that void. As identified by Fort and Schipani, business may promote more peaceful societies by encouraging a sense of community. We argue that one way to reach that goal is for business to provide what we denote as complementary alternative benefits (CABs), to its workforce. In this article, we advocate for businesses to offer CABs which focus on sustaining the health, reducing the stress, and improving the camaraderie of its workforce. We argue that business can use these benefits to promote a healthy, less-stressed, and collegial workforce that is less prone to resolve conflicts by violence. Further, we examine the role business plays in promoting more peaceful societies and how employer-initiated stress reduction programs are consistent with both business ethics and peace-building principles. Finally, using case studies we demonstrate how CABs may also reduce costs related to absenteeism and turnover, and thus improve the bottom line. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Business and society; Business ethics; Community; Complementary alternative benefits; Employee benefits; Peace building; Peace Through Commerce; Workplace stress",

However, since the AACSB does not require the inclusion of a specific course to achieve this objective, it may be satisfied by establishing a stand-alone course in ethical decision-making, by integrating ethical decision-making into the existing curricula, by some combination of the two strategies, or through some alternative mechanism.

With learning objectives designed precisely to measure the student delta based on content, process and engagement in a particular class, those programs that have opted for stand-alone ethics courses may be (though not necessarily are) more prepared to respond to assessment-related inquiries regarding their programs or satisfaction of the standards. The relevance of the AACSB standards modification to the current efforts at ethics integration in business programs is instead a re-examination of how to create a program of integration that is designed to ensure the most effective learning results possible, while responding to the challenges presented by the integrated approach. The purpose of this article is to explore some of those challenges that may be somewhat universal to business school programs implementing the integrated approach, and to share one large university's response to those challenges, along with lessons learned. © Springer 2010.","Aacsb; Assessment; Business schools; Ethical decision-making; Ethics curricula; Ethics integration; Ethics modules; Leadership",

The focus of many of these branding initiatives has frequently been on the creative elements of logo, tagline, and advertising theme, with only limited consideration for the importance of generating stakeholder support and experience delivery. Active stakeholder engagement, to build the brand from the inside out during its planning process, has been shown to be an important factor in those initiatives that are considered more successful. This chapter highlights the need to engage stakeholders in the brand planning for destinations from the earliest stages. It illustrates a consultative model for destination brand planning, primary with a US case study, along with examples of some other cities. © 2009 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand adoption and planning; Branding; City brands; Consultation; Stakeholders",

Invoking precedents by authors such as Jonsen and Toulmin, McIntyre, Niebuhr, Weber, De Tocqueville, Machiavelli and others, this essay explores several important ways in which a due regard for history can and should shape the practice of business ethics. Thus a due regard for history helps us both to cultivate fitting appreciation of cultural mores and to understand how current problems and issues have developed as they have; it helps us to gauge current responsibilities with respect legacies of problems inherited from the past; it helps us to develop a lively sense of what is possible in the present, given current contingencies and past experiences; and it moves us to rethink the practice of ethical auditing: not just as a backward-looking effort to gauge compliance but as a forward-looking way of learning from actual experiences and developing fitting responses. © Springer 2010.","Contingencies; Conventions; Ethics; Historical possibilities; History; Legacies",

Businesses are perceived as being selfish and indifferent to the impact their operations may have on the social and political development of local communities. Additionally, the corruption of local governments has been cited as interfering with the creation of stability in conflict areas. Within this framework, multinational Public-Private Partnerships can exert two forms of influence: they can either exacerbate these problems, or they can become part of the solution. Without a relationship of trust among local businesses, government, and the private sector, peace building efforts will at best be mixed, and could possibly perpetuate violence in fragile states. Public and private interests are better served when Public-Private Partnerships are based upon collaboration and assist in establishing principles of good governance in conflict areas.

One of these instruments legitimizes itself by its legal character - a group of laws, norms, and juridical means that regulate corporate responsibility. Within this perspective, the concept of social responsibility would be restricted to the concept of regulated responsibility. Thus, it can be observed that in the literature the innumerable faces presented as social responsibility, indicating a difference in terms of the concept: many meanings, interpretations, and possibilities. Since there is not much clarity, many actions can be classified as social ones. However, the truth is that they tend to be more regulated actions or another component of management. Briefly, this paper aims to identify and provide understanding to the discursive practices about social responsibility in Brazil. The idea was to analyze the institutionalized practices and how the discourse is configured in that country. In Brazil, one could observe the different approaches taken about the field of corporate social responsibility. During the 1960s, the attitude taken by Brazilian corporate entities was that the problem didn't exist; by the 1970s, there was a general acceptance that the problem exists, but it is not mine; by the 1980s the view changes to that of, the problem exists, and I know how to solve it and today, with all the social problems in the country and pressures from various sources, Brazilian companies are concerned about the problem and how to solve it from its very source. In this sense, one can argue that Brazilian society is more participative and more pro-active about the subject of CSR than ever before. Presently, the configuration of corporate social responsibility in Brazil is changing as a result of the sustainability discourse, there are many critical positive aspects of CRS, especially those concerning social and philanthropic actions. The main argument is that taking a social action does not necessarily mean being socially responsible, since the action is simply philanthropic and does not produce sustainability. Finally, one can conclude that social responsibility in Brazil is a discourse that is under construction. Therefore, there is an opportunity to reflect and to learn more about it. Nowadays, social responsibility is shared among social actors and Brazilian civil society is more concerned about the need for sustainable development. Brazilians are more conscious of irresponsible social practices and would put pressure on the government, corporate entities, and individuals in order to produce sustainable development. In this sense, we concur with José Gabriel López, from Ford Foundation, who pointed out the need to develop new models for development that promote equity, social justice and sound environmental stewardship. It is a challenge for everyone, regardless of whether Brazilians or some other nationals. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,

This is an exploration and learning from the experience of Finnish companies, as well as other actors interested or involved in shaping the course of CSR both locally and globally. The results of the exploration provide insightful information and descriptions of a roadmap useful in learning and understanding the role CSR in Finnish companies. The roadmap starts with variations of CSR concepts and framing CSR within the corporate responsibility concept. Other roadmap indicators are globalization, stakeholders, and pursuit of sustainable development as the main drivers of CSR, as well as employees, suppliers, community, and customers as key management areas of CSR. The roadmap also indicates the importance of Finnish culture, which has a positive influence on the views, thinking, and management practices of CSR issues, thus making it easy to discuss and understand CSR in businesses. The experience of selected Finnish companies in implementing CSR policies in the supply chain presents a concrete proactive step in advancing socially responsible practices with suppliers both locally and globally. Despite the problems and complexities, particularly in the global supply chain, managing CSR for Finnish companies presents new opportunities and challenges that are expected to intensify in the near future. The proactive stance of Finnish companies towards CSR is complemented by the active supporting role of important societal actors such as the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These actors embark on various promotional efforts and campaigns, thus making CSR a well-acknowledged concept among Finnish companies and strengthening the synergistic learning of CSR within the Finnish businesses and communities. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,

CSR has become an idea on the corporate agenda in Sweden. This chapter describes how CSR arrived in Sweden and how social responsibility takes its form and translates into practice in Swedish corporations. In order to understand the background of how CSR entered the Swedish business community, the chapter begins by describing social responsibility from a historical perspective and the recent revival of CSR in Sweden. In broad terms, the topic of the social responsibility of business has a long root in different societies around the world. The emergence of the industrial community in Sweden between the mid-seventeenth century and the mid-nineteenth century was a period in which Swedish corporations had played a prominent role in the local community, contributing to the development of several social institutions, including the fire brigade, medical services, and schools. During the last century, the scope of corporate responsibilities was marginalized to that of economic responsibility. However, in the last 20 years, the Swedish discourse on corporate responsibilities has changed in concert with the state of the market and with the division of roles between corporations and the state. As in many other countries, Swedish companies are being criticized by stakeholders and they are being urged to take on greater responsibilities both in Sweden and elsewhere. Hence, during the last few decades, the field of CSR has solidified and taken a better shape both nationally and internationally. The chapter discusses how companies listed in the Swedish stock exchange communicate information on their CSR activities and also examines how three large Swedish corporations practice CSR. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,

The case describes a brief history of several employees who filed a lawsuit against the firm claiming racial, disability and gender discrimination after they were overlooked for promotion, or were poorly treated, and eventually terminated. The case has a difficulty level appropriate for a junior level course in human resource management, business ethics, or principles of management. The case is designed to be taught in one class periods (may vary from fifty-five minutes to eighty minutes depending upon the course structure and the instructional approach employed) and is expected to require between four to six hours of outside preparation by students. Case Synopsis: Derived from observation and field interviews, the case describes the plight of several workers within Darius D'Amore's Financial Administration Division and what incidents lead to their eventually filing a lawsuit against the firm. Rich Rogers, 43, had been with the company as a supervisor in the Corporate Credit Department since 1997. Mr. Rogers, a white male, had his Bachelor's degree in management and was enrolled in an MBA program at a local University. Rogers was fighting stage 4-lung cancer since 1996. His condition was not revealed to the Company or his co-workers until 1998. He made his condition known at that time because he needed to take a two-month leave to have bilateral lung surgery. Mr. Rogers, on several occasions, felt that he was passed over for promotion because of his illness and questioned why he was training his supervisors if he wasn't qualified for the job. When Rogers brought up several racial incidents to the head of the Division, Kevin Simmons, he was told to mind his own business and that no matter how hard you work, you will never be promoted. Several other racial and discriminatory incidents occurred that impacted and/or were observed by Les Ford, a 44 year old African American employee, and Jasmine Young, a 25 year old African American female. Their complaints to both management and human resource management went unheeded and eventually Rogers and Young were fired while Ford quit.

The findings show that petition signatories are generally very angry about the Canadian Seal Hunt, pledge to boycott for a variety of objectives (instrumental, expressive, and punitive), abhor cruelty against animals, do not believe that it is acceptable to kill an animal for its fur, and worry about the environment in general.

While SIEs form a major part of the informal workforce in developing countries and contribute significantly to economic growth, their potential is being undermined when they engage in irresponsible and deceptive business practices such as overpricing, sale of underweight or substandard products, or attempts to hoard goods, to name a few. Despite the growing interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives of small businesses in developing countries, the SIEs have received almost no attention. To address this void in the literature, we explore the reasons for the less than optimal level of social responsibility demonstrated by some SIEs in developing countries.We do so by drawing upon the existing literature to develop a comprehensive framework of social responsibility of SIEs highlighting their unique characteristics and the different contextual factors that they encounter in developing countries.

We describe and analyze ethically relevant dimensions of each corporation's culture and practices, including their corporate cultures and the ethical issues they face. We argue that these companies add value to China's social and economic transformation in several important ways, including their development of human capital - the enhanced skill sets, work experiences, and values acquired by their workers.We conclude by highlighting three ethical challenges that seem most critical for these two firms: (a) creating mutual benefit for the corporation and the host country; (b) localization andmanagement of the cultural gap between expats and localworkers; and (c) dealing effectively with the power and roles of a large, pervasive government in a non-democratic society.

The case describes a brief history of several employees who filed a lawsuit against the firm claiming racial, disability and gender discrimination after they were overlooked for promotion, or were poorly treated, and eventually terminated. The case has a difficulty level appropriate for a junior level course in human resource management, business ethics, or principles of management. The case is designed to be taught in one class periods (may vary from fifty-five minutes to eighty minutes depending upon the course structure and the instructional approach employed) and is expected to require between four to six hours of outside preparation by students. Case Synopsis: Derived from observation and field interviews, the case describes the plight of several workers within Darius D'Amore's Financial Administration Division and what incidents lead to their eventually filing a lawsuit against the firm. Rich Rogers, 43, had been with the company as a supervisor in the Corporate Credit Department since 1997. Mr. Rogers, a white male, had his Bachelor's degree in management and was enrolled in an MBA program at a local University. Rogers was fighting stage 4-lung cancer since 1996. His condition was not revealed to the Company or his co-workers until 1998. He made his condition known at that time because he needed to take a two-month leave to have bilateral lung surgery. Mr. Rogers, on several occasions, felt that he was passed over for promotion because of his illness and questioned why he was training his supervisors if he wasn't qualified for the job. When Rogers brought up several racial incidents to the head of the Division, Kevin Simmons, he was told to mind his own business and that no matter how hard you work, you will never be promoted. Several other racial and discriminatory incidents occurred that impacted and/or were observed by Les Ford, a 44 year old African American employee, and Jasmine Young, a 25 year old African American female. Their complaints to both management and human resource management went unheeded and eventually Rogers and Young were fired while Ford quit. The case ends with the three of them bringing a lawsuit against the firm. © 2009 by the DreamCatchers Group.",,

This paper suggests that a professional spirit should be developed which could function as a filter of commercial reasoning. Broadly, management will not be organised within the framework of a well-established profession unless formal knowledge, licensing, professional autonomy and professional codes of conduct are developed sufficiently. In developing business management as a profession, law may play a key role. Where the idea is that business management should be more professsionalised, managers must show that they are willing to adopt ethical values, while arriving at business decisions. The paper argues that ethics cannot survive without legal regulation, which, in turn, will not be supported by law unless lawyers can find alternative solutions to the large mechanisms of the official society, secured by the monopolised coercion of the nation state. From a micro perspective of law and business ethics, communities can be developed with their own conventions, rules and standards that are generated and sanctioned within the boundaries of the communities themselves. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Business management as a profession; Contents and nature of management activities; Formal knowledge; Licensing; Professional autonomy; Professional codes of conduct; Viable morality and its legal component",

Potential SME benefits and firm and sector-specific strategies drive the adoption and use of ICT. Furthermore, sectors are increasingly global and dominated by large firms and the structure of their values chains and operations shape opportunities for SMEs. Principal reasons for non-adoption are lack of applicability and little incentive to change business models when returns are unclear. SMEs also face generic barriers to adoption including trust and transaction security and IPR concerns, and challenges in areas of management skills, technological capabilities, productivity and competitiveness. The issues for governments throughout the European Union (EU) are to foster appropriate business environments for eBusiness and ICT uptake, and target programs to overcome market failures to the extent that they are needed in particular areas (e.g. skill formation, specialized information). Governments have a range of SME eBusiness and internet use programs. However, commercial considerations and potential returns are the principal drivers of SME adoption and profitable use. The key drivers for enabling eBusiness development are commitment and support of industry associations, in particular in sectoral initiatives, synergies by having access to resources from other initiatives or organizations, competitive pressure and ease of participation. The key barriers slowing ICT adoption are competition among companies in the target group, Lack of awareness, often combined with mistrust regarding ICT and ICT service providers, costs, lack of internal ICT and management knowledge, Network infrastructure issues: access and interoperability, Legal uncertainties. The European Commission has identified 3 factors that make it difficult for SMEs, in particular, to engage more fully with ICT and develop sustainable business practices: 1) the relatively high costs associated with investments in ICT; 2) the lack of technical and managerial skills and; 3) reluctance on the part of SMEs to network with other enterprises. The proposed framework summarizes the main policy directions derived from the analysis and the key areas of eBusiness support - Business environment, Skills upgrading, Network infrastructure, Trust infrastructure, Digital products and information services, Intangible investments and assets, Information, Government on-line. Finally the paper maps proposed key eBusiness support areas around key dimensions of eBusiness (functional, sectoral, and regional/spatial) on three distinct levels (micro: the level of the firm, meso: the level of the region, and macro: national/international).","Ebusiness; Ict impact; Smes; Support policy framework",

Conventional wisdom suggests that public (publicly traded) corporations are more susceptible to corruption and socially irresponsible behavior than privately owned corporations because of the intense short-term profit maximization pressure from shareholders and the lack of sufficient monitoring mechanisms. This study introduces an alternate perspective in thinking about the relationship between ownership form and corporate social responsibility. This study reasons that public corporations are more likely to become socially responsible because of their greater exposure to external influence and greater dependence on external actors with diverse interests. Using a panel data on the pollution management practices of 118 industrial facilities over a 13-year period, this study shows that public corporations were indeed subject to greater external pressure to reduce pollution, and the pressure led to consistently stronger environmental performance. © 2009 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

For the next year, accounting fraud at a long series of Fortune 500 companies made headlines. The worst cases led to spectacular bankruptcies, mass layoffs, and criminal prosecutions. Many other companies remained intact, but paid millions of dollars to settle charges that their books did not correspond to financial reality. The economic costs of the corporate scandals were substantial: trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth lost and a climate of uncertainty that may have suppressed business investment and hiring after the 2001 recession ended. The barriers to corporate fraud set in place after the Great Depression had clearly failed to protect public investors and were put under close scrutiny. Congress responded by passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, strengthening regulation of auditors, directors, and corporate executives and increasing criminal penalties for fraud. During the 2003-2004 school year, Professor William Black's class at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs of the University of Texas examined corporate fraud from a multi-disciplinary perspective. Rather than viewing fraud as simply a securities law matter, the class considered the insights of criminology, sociology, management science, business ethics, behavioral economics, complex systems theory, and other fields. This book is the result of their investigations. The book focuses on the internal controls on American corporations (including corporate governance, business ethics, managerial structure and compensation, internal counsel, and whistleblowers), as well as external controls (government regulation, external auditors and accountants, and the judicial process). A recurring theme is the limited efficacy of many safeguards and watchdogs in cases of ""control fraud,"" where fraud is directed or abetted by top management, and where unethical or abusive practices may become the organizational norm. It may then be easier for employees, directors, auditors, and even government regulators to go along with the prevailing trends, rather than take a stand which might disrupt the smooth functioning of the business, and could bring on devastating personal and organizational consequences. Another broad question raised by the book is whether the post-Enron scandals were a one-time event, made possible by the stock market bubble of the 1990s and several other unique historical developments which together constituted a ""perfect storm,"" or whether fraud is a cyclical phenomenon associated with the end of long bull markets. The question has policy implications: if recent corporate scandals represent an unfortunate result of a unique set of conditions, one might conclude that the restraints now in place are sufficient to prevent outbreaks of fraud under normal circumstances. On the other hand, if fraud is cyclical and can be expected to reappear once stock prices begin to soar again, one might conclude that the post- Enron scandals have revealed fundamental weaknesses in law and regulation. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The catalyst for this call was the recognition that even under optimal conditions, good companies sometimes are susceptible to moral lapses, and when companies undertake ventures in authoritarian countries with poor human rights records, even those with the best intentions may find themselves drawn into complicity in human rights abuses. There, market exigencies may persuade them to leave their codes of ethics and commitments to human rights at home. Pragmatism, it would seem, requires thatthey accept the ethical inconsistencies that follow from a ""When in Rome, do as they Romans do"" outlook. When facing the moral dilemma about whether or not to invest in human rights abusing countries, companies are offered two alternatives: they can operate in those countries and accept potential complicity or they can stay away. We suggest, however, that a preferable option is to address the underlying problem, and to this end we advocate the promulgation of a declaration for business that is comparable to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our proposed name for this is the ""Declaration on the Universal Rights and Duties of Business."" To be effective, such a declaration would require enforcement mechanisms. To illustrate this issue, we focus on China, not because China is unique in its human rights abuses, but because China occupies such a central place in the globalization efforts of the major companies from around the world. A robust international declaration is needed to provide a common framework for the practice of consistent and fair business competition everywhere. © 2009 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

PMI describes the ethical decision making at the individual level, CEV assesses the influences of the organization's ethical culture on the decisions of the individual, and PIE reveals what the businesspeople believe about the relationships among business, ethics, and long-run profitability. The survey respondents are professional marketers and businesspeople currently enrolled in or graduated from MBA programs in Turkey (n = 416), Thailand (n = 605), and US (n = 446). The ANOVA results reveal that American businesspeople are more likely to perceive the unethical marketing behaviors as more serious than their counterparts in Turkey and Thailand. American and Turkish organizations are found to have higher CEV than Thai organizations. On the other hand, Thai and American businesspeople perceived ethics to be more important for business success than Turkish businesspeople. The understanding of the differences and similarities in ethical perceptions of the businesspeople from various countries is valuable for a successful and harmonious working together when engaging in global marketing activities. This study is thus believed to be useful for people who plan to invest or manage businesses in these countries, and many of the implications are thought to be valuable in international business arena. © Springer 2010.","Businesspeople; Crosscultural comparison; Ethics; Marketing",

In the present chapter, I explore the likely effects of such complementarity on group creativity. I propose specifically that expressions of dominance, even those borne not out of formal hierarchy but rather out of such factors as expertise and enthusiasm for the task, are likely to elicit submissive responses from fellow group members when the group is trying to generate creative ideas. As group members behaving submissively are likely to contribute fewer ideas to group discussion, I argue that group members who behave dominantly may, through their influence on other group members, reduce both the number and diversity of ideas generated within the group. I, therefore, propose that dominance complementarity may impair groups' abilities to generate creative ideas.",,

On a regional level, discordance is far more prevalent, and India operates in a South Asian environment where domestic military interventions are not uncommon - Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka being clear examples. Moreover, the influence of China in the region cannot be overlooked, since India's defense policy is often a reaction to the role of China and the presence of conventional and nuclear forces. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, in particular, threatens a delicate balance in a highly volatile region where China exerts enormous influence on neighboring states including Pakistan. An argument can be made that India's domestic concordance between the military, the political elites, and the citizenry contributes to the preservation of regional stability, because India has chosen to maintain its regional strength vis-à-vis China and Pakistan, while continuing to search for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue with allies such as the United States. India's most recent and ongoing nuclear deal with the United States originally struck in 2005 is an example of the delicate synergies taking place to offset potential threats from China, Pakistan, and Iran, while maintaining domestic military and technological strength. Although India's successful domestic course encourages partnerships among international political and corporate allies, Pakistan's continuous domestic discordance has resulted in recent difficult relations with the United States, India, and Afghanistan. Pakistan's inability to quell al-Quaeda extremism has contributed to a lack of domestic confidence in General Musharraf's political agenda. Musharraf has continued the discordant political and social relationship begun by his predecessor Ayub Khan. As a result of Khan's initial and dramatic alienation of the East Bengali community, Pakistan's military and political elites have never recovered the domestic credibility needed to partner with other political groups and the citizenry - a credibility so vital to domestic concordance and international foreign policy.I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed.

Chat rooms have grown tremendously over recent years and, as a phenomenon, could have important implications for marketing scholars and practitioners. The paper uses a structured qualitative methodology and is based on the author's participative observations in Israeli chat rooms over a period of two years. The main findings emerging from the observations are that individuals spend time in such rooms because they provide numerous benefits that parallel those accorded by non-virtual communities. Following Muniz and O'Guinn (2001, p. 412), a chat room community is defined as a ""specialized, non-geographically bound community, based on a structured set of social relationships"". However, the emphasis in chat rooms shifts from the common use of a brand, as in Muniz and O'Guinn's (2001) definition, to common users of the chat rooms in question. Specifically, this paper identifies chat rooms as modern communities and highlights their similarity to conventional communities. On-line chat rooms satisfy the conditions for communities' existence (Jones 1997), namely virtual common-public-space, communicators' variety, existence of a boundary for the virtual community, sustained members' stability and interactivity, interactivity of verbal messages, message directing and targeting, interactivity in message content, action-simulating messages, and nickname stability (Liu 1997). Two major managerial implications are drawn. First, managers of Internet Service and Portal providers should account for chat rooms' popularity. Sites that do not include chat room should incorporate them. Second, while McAlexander, Schouten, and Koenig (2002) and Muniz and O'Guinn (2001) have shown how brand communities are important to marketing managers, chat rooms can be used differently than brand-related chat rooms. Specifically, chat rooms can be used to launch a new product or service in line with the demographic composition of those in specific rooms. For example, a party in a nightclub can be described by, allegedly, an innocent chatter, in a chat room of people in their 20s. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It occurs when solutions to address clients' needs are developed in collaboration and the resulting products and services are distributed through a flexible network of partners. Daniel Fasnacht's book, the first of its kind, discusses open business models in the context of the financial services industry. He elaborates the drivers for strategic change such as increasingly sophisticated clients or demanding shareholders among other trends, including the recent global financial crisis, and explains why the transition from a closed model of operation to open innovation is vital. Various case studies illustrate how to integrate the client into the firm's innovation process and emphasize the importance of smart client segmentation and a holistic advisory model to serve clients around the globe. Leaders must develop a set of new management practices to be able to invest in multiple strategic directions. They are responsible for giving clients a remarkable experience and for creating social relationship capital based upon an open innovation culture. Open Innovation in the Financial Services provides a much-needed framework for helping to understand industry dynamics in banking and to make the most of organizational energy by using open innovation to sustain profitable growth.

Financial, technical and institutional limitationsforce authorities to discharge substantial amounts of untreated or partially treatedwastewater into surface waters. Consequently, uncontrolled use of polluted wateris increasingly common in the downstream peri-urban areas. Although wastewateruse bears a significant risk on human health, such use is also productive and an assetfor many. Agricultural use of wastewater is a strong manifestation of the urban-rural connection and transfers a waterborne risk from the wastewater disposalsystem to the food chain, requiring a paradigm shift in the approaches appliedto risk minimization. Conventional models for urban wastewater treatment andmanagement are based on top-down, technically driven approaches that do not,or do not sufficiently, consider the links between the social, economic and healthaspects. This situation is understandable from historical and technological points ofview, but does not provide innovative solutions to current problems in developingcountrycities. A different approach is required, one that rethinks conventionalwastewater system design and management. By adopting a systems approach toanalysing both the water and food chains, one discovers the interactions of differentstakeholders that treat and use (or abuse) water, the impacts on overall productivityand the risks. Governance systems to manage wastewater use in agriculture must incorporate decentralization to accommodate thinking at the bottom layer,encourage stakeholder engagement and provide coordination and policy cohesionfor managing risks jointly from both the water and food chains. © International Water Management Institute and International Development Research Centre, 2010.

The result has been a confusing mix of standards and their defenses. Thus, there is widespread recognition that business requires a common framework to provide ethical guidance. One of the most prominent conceptual frameworks recently offered, which addresses issues of international business ethics, is that of integrative social contracts theory (ISCT) developed by Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee. By integrating normative and empirical matters, and drawing on the concepts of social contracts and hypernorms, ISCT seeks to provide a workable, comprehensive theory of business ethics. In this article I argue that, in fact, ISCT offers two different views of hypernorms and the theoretical structure surrounding them. A Principlist View that understands hypernorms as the most general, universal moral principles that hold moral sway over all microsocial contracts. A Contextualist View is that hypernorms are not special, additional norms, but refer to a certain status that the most general norms or principles of each community achieve that are part of a convergence with the norms of other societies. I maintain that the Contextualist View offers a plausible view of ISCT while avoiding many of the criticisms that have been made against the Principlist interpretation of ISCT. Further, the Contextualist View suggests other areas in which ISCT needs further development, such as in the area of human rights which I also briefly explore. © Springer 2009.","Donaldson; Dunfee; Human rights; Hypernorms; Integrative social contracts theory; Moral free space; Social contract; Stakeholder theory",

Through the use of a three-tiered conceptual framework that distinguishes between the basic game of antagonistic social cooperation, the meta game of rule-setting, and the meta-meta game of rule-finding discourse, we address three questions, the answers to which we believe are crucial to fostering effective business leadership and corporate social responsibility. First, the purpose of business in society is value creation. Companies have a social mandate to organize mutually advantageous cooperation. Second, business ethics should teach the management competencies necessary to fulfill business's societal mandate. These competencies are optimization competence in the basic game of value creation, governance competence in the meta game of (political) rule setting, and the three discourse-related skills of orientation competence, reception competence, and communication competence necessary for engaging in the meta-meta game. Third, companies can help solve global problems through global corporate citizenship if they participate as political and moral actors in rule-setting processes and rule-finding discourse aimed at laying the foundation for value creation on a global scale. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Management education; New governance; Ordonomics; Social dilemmas; Social entrepreneurship; Stakeholder theory",

At that time there were few general principles that could serve as guidelines for global business. However, since 1991 a plethora of such principles have been developed to serve as guidelines and evaluative mechanisms for global corporate responsibilities. But operationalizing these principles in practice has been a challenge for most transnational corporations and even for smaller, more local enterprises. This is because, in some cases, the principles ask too much of companies. In other cases, the principles are ambiguous. And in still other cases, the principles, written by and large from a Western, rights-based perspective, cannot be operationalized in some cultural or religious settings. In this paper I will outline a series of dilemmas multinational enterprises face in the global market place, even when they sincerely sign on to one or another set of principles. These problems are not insurmountable, but in the imperfect world of commerce, require that our expectations of corporate responsibilities be satisficing rather than absolutist. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Some handholds that seem promising may ultimately lead a climber to a dead end, while others allow a person to reach the desired destination. Different climbers, presented with the same rock face, may choose a different set of handholds and, therefore, follow a slightly different path. Using this rock-climbing metaphor, Laurie Regelbrugge, then a manager of corporate responsibility at the oil and gas operator Unocal, described how she found ‘handholds’ to establish traction and create opportunities to align and integrate citizenship throughout her company. This is an account of how she and other middle managers led change in their companies, not from the typical planned, top-down model but rather through what some term an ‘emergent-pragmatic’ or catalytic approach. Here we first look at the problems these practitioners faced, some of the tactics employed and their rationale for adopting the catalytic versus top-down model of change. The chapter then examines several key components of this model in action and what insights emerged about leading change from the middle. The data were gathered in the Executive Forum – a multi-year business/university learning group that brought these practitioners together to swap knowledge and offer one another advice and that provided the basis for this research on integrating corporate citizenship into firms. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,

Meanwhile, the international business (IB) literature has addressed the international dimension of CSP more directly, but focuses largely on extrinsic pressures. Our paper links the management and IB literatures by addressing intrinsic drivers (management commitment to ethics) in conjunction with extrinsic (trade-related) drivers for both foreign- and domestically-owned firms in a single-market setting. Using survey data from 121 auto parts suppliers in Mexico, we find that management commitment to ethics is a dominant driver of CSP among both foreign and domestic firms.

Instead, such a duty necessarily must be grounded in positive obligation. In the search of a foundation for a positive duty for corporations to further just institutions, Stephen Kobrin's notion of ""private political authority"" offers a promising connecting point. Political authority implies political responsibility; Political obligation, however, includes more than merely not doing any harm it is essentially positive obligation. The implications of the new political responsibilities of multinational corporations may even go far beyond the particular duty to promote just institutions; they may be symptomatic for a much more profound shift from an individual to a collective age. © 2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

As noted by The Economist, ‘Corporate Social Responsibility is now an industry of its own right, and a flourishing profession as well.’ This field involves the creation of a set of markets devoted to the communication, measurement and evaluation of CSR and Corporate Social Performance (CSP). It is also marked by the multiplication of sectoral codes of conduct and other global standards. It has also been accompanied by the emergence of new kinds of actors and CSR experts outside (CSR consultants and auditors) and within companies (sustainability or CSR departments have been created within most public companies) and the multiplication of educational programmes dealing with CSR management. To some extent, this situation echoes the ‘Corporate Social Responsiveness’ era of the late 1960s and 1970s. In a turbulent societal context, various companies had developed issues management departments to handle pressing social controversies, such as equal rights for minorities, consumer rights or environmental concerns. Researchers who studied those dynamics based their approach on the idea that CSR was not only a question of ethics, but that it also involved specific and difficult managerial problems. In itself, managers' will to increase the social good was not enough to implement efficient and sustainable CSR programmes. Rather, a key question was to understand how to select the most pressing issues, take relevant decisions, develop the appropriate management frameworks, tools and implementation approaches to respond to social pressures. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,

Three approaches to human rights are distinguished: moral, political, and legal. It is argued that the tripartite framework's grounding of the responsibility of TNCs to respect human rights is properly understood as moral and not merely as a political or legal duty. A moral account of the duty of TNCs to respect basic human rights is defended and contrasted with a merely strategic approach. The main conclusion of the article is that only a moral account of the basic human rights duties of TNCs provides a sufficiently deep justification of ""the corporate responsibility to respect human rights"" feature of the tripartite framework. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

It is not possible to write about the COP experience of Petrobras without telling the story of the progress of the company regarding social and environmental corporate responsibility during recent years. Petrobras is an integrated oil and gas company, the largest corporation in Brazil, and one of the major companies in the international oil sector. As such, Petrobras acknowledges its prime responsibility for the environment where it operates and striving for sustainable development is a historical commitment of the company. Recently, these efforts have shown important improvements being integrated in its corporate governance. In 2007, Social Responsibility became a corporate function at Petrobras. Therefore, in the ‘2020 Petrobras Strategic Plan’ the mission of the company is to ‘[o]perate in a safe and profitable manner in Brazil and abroad, with social and environmental responsibility, providing products and services that meet client needs and that contribute to the development of Brazil and of the countries where we operate’. The company vision for 2020 is ‘We will be one of the five largest integrated energy companies in the world and the preferred choice among our stakeholders’. Two characteristics of this vision are that Petrobras' operations should be a benchmark in social and environmental responsibility and committed to sustainable development. For this management challenge, a strategic goal for 2020 was also set: ‘To be a world class reference for social responsibility, contributing to the development of sustainable business models.’ © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,

It addresses the indirect cost of companies' symbolic actions and develops a new concept of the 'social energy penalty' - the cost to society when powerful corporate actors limit the social conversation on environmental problems and their solutions. This thoughtful book develops a set of tools for researchers, regulators and managers to separate useful environmental information from empty corporate spin, and will appeal to researchers and students of corporate responsibility, corporate environmental strategy and sustainable business, as well as environmental practitioners. © Frances Bowen 2014.",,

It is perhaps not surprising that a theory as popular as stakeholder theory should be used in different ways, but when the disparity between different uses becomes too great, it is questionable whether all the 'stakeholder research' refers to the same underlying theory. This paper starts to clarify this definitional confusion by distinguishing between three different ways in which different lines of stakeholder research are connected with descriptive and instrumental stakeholder theory. First, a distinction is made between research connected with descriptive and with instrumental stakeholder theory as defined by Donaldson &Preston in the narrow or broad sense. Second, a distinction is made between research that interprets descriptive and instrumental stakeholder theories as either hypotheses or research areas. Third, a distinction is made between research that interprets Donaldson &Preston's central concept of 'stakeholder management' as either behaviour or rationale. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these differences for empirical research into stakeholder theory. © 2009 The Authors.",,

The data were collected using a survey research instrument in the years 1994, 1999 and 2004. The research results show a positive change in managers' corporate responsibility perceptions during this time period.

Design/methodology/ approach - The research conducted is of an eminently explorative nature. The research operations are fundamentally based on direct observation and use is also made of secondary sources - especially publications and the contributions of independent web-based agencies. Findings - The number of companies that the research conducted made it possible to identify is not actually very high. Indeed, at present the list counts nine such firms. What should be underlined is that these are not enterprises that have decided to adopt a corporate social responsibility or corporate citizenship approach while still leaving their basic nature substantively unchanged. They are, rather, firms that can be termed ""anomalous"", given that, in one way or another, they operate outside the conventional rules on the way business is conceived and practised. Research limitations/implications - Research limitations are primarily in the short number of case studies considered, second in the lack of any contact with the firms examined and, by consequence, in the use of sole company web site information or secondary sources. Starting from the collection of firms which in turn show one or more peculiar features in their structure or behaviour, research implications stem from the opportunity to reason around a new firm's model credibly enough, as such a reasoning relies on some empirical evidence. Originality/value - The paper's value lies in its effort of documenting the existence of firms going, one way or another, out of the box in their way of doing business and in focusing on some peculiar features far from ""conventional managerial wisdom"" but which do not compromise these firms' competitiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business enterprise; Companies; Corporate strategy; Economic models","Business enterprise; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate strategies; Direct observation; Economic models; Empirical evidence; Human faces; New enterprise; New forms; Research limitations; Research operations; Competition; Research"

Business leaders, as well as leaders from government and civil society, increasingly argue that business must play a constructive role in addressing massive global challenges. Business is not responsible for causing most of the problems associated with, for example, extreme poverty and hunger, child mortality and HIV/AIDS – and, arguably, it is only indirectly responsible for most of the problems of climate change. However, it is often claimed that business has a responsibility to help ameliorate many of these problems and, indeed, it may be the only institution capable of effectively addressing some of them. As a result, corporate responsibility has secured the attention of business leaders, governments and NGOs to an unprecedented extent. Thus this book, Global Challenges in Responsible Business – which originated in an international conference on corporate responsibility organized at London Business School – addresses the implications for business of corporate responsibility in the context of globalization and the social and environmental problems faced by global business today. The book offers a rich set of articles reflective of research on corporate responsibility, many of which are informed by empirical studies.

Questions about the moral justifiability of the capitalist system, the basis of property rights, and the problem of inequality in the distribution of income have been of central importance in both fields. However, political philosophers have developed, especially over the past four decades, a set of tools and concepts for addressing these questions that are in many ways quite distinctive. Most business ethicists, on the other hand, consider their field to be primarily a domain of applied ethics, and so adopt methods and conceptual frameworks developed by moral philosophers. In this paper, we discuss some of the salient differences between these two approaches, and suggest some ways in which business ethicists could benefit from taking a more ""political philosophy"" approach to these questions. Throughout, we underline the importance of seeking greater compatibility among the principles used in normative theorizing about markets, regulations, corporate governance, and business practices. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Western scholarship and practice tends to depict home country standards as ""higher"" or more ""restrictive"" or ""well-ordered"" than the ""lower"" standards of emerging market actors. As much as the question appears culturally neutral, many who ask it do so with a culturally-specific lens shaped by prevailing conditions of Western economic strength. However, the dominant economic powers of the future are not likely to be the same North American and Western European markets that have reigned supreme in the recent past. As corporations increasingly re-examine their political roles in global governance, we need also to re-examine the moral authority of global ethical norms so they do not merely reflect the dominant ideologies of the most economically powerful market actors. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

At the same time, CEOs have lost considerable power, leaving many struggling to regain their control and maintain their compensation levels, while others adopt a stewardship approach to their posts.

There has been active research in the well-being of nations across the globe in the last two decades, resulting in substantial theoretical progress and a wealth of empirical data on the well-beings of different nations across the globe. Dissatisfied with the conventional measures such as the GDP, well-being researchers have been developing alternative measures that can better capture the true nature of the well-being of a country. The paper begins by examining why the GDP is inadequate as a good measure of the well-being of a country. Major alternative proposals on well-being or similar measures are summarized. Objective well-being of a nation refers to the conditions of well-being of a country. Subjective well-being of a nation is the perceptions of its citizens with regard to their satisfaction with the major conditions of living in that nation. The paper presents two central arguments leading to the conclusion that business ethics is an integral part of the well-being of a country. The first argument utilizes the concept of workplace well-being to establish the linkage. The second argument uses evidence from a recent survey of the perceptions of Taiwanese people on business ethics in relation to the well-being of a nation. The paper also reveals that common values tie the two together at a deeper level. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; business well-being; values; well-being; workplace well-being",

It reviews the extant business ethics literature on China, collects data on ethical conduct from a large Chinese university, and analyzes the data to examine emerging trends. Design/methodology/approach – Factor analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS) are applied to an established survey instrument after reliability is confirmed. Findings – Principal-components factor analysis uncovers six main factors. MDS further reduces the explanatory variables into four ethical dimensions, while increasing the number of useable observations. These four dimensions are then correlated with some demographic and psychographic variables. Results reveal four quadrants with different characteristics: Quadrant I “Unsympathetic, ethically challenged, self centered” have lower grade-point index (GPA); Quadrant II “Ethically challenged, other directed” have higher GPA, watch more TV, and are more likely to be female; Quadrant III “Community orientation, ethically centered” are more likely to be female with higher class ranking and Quadrant IV “Challenge avoidance, controlling, religious” are more likely to have a lower GPA and lower level of religiosity. Research limitations/implications – Inferences from this paper may be limited to the sample group. Further expansion of the paper may suggest additional insights. Originality/value – Ethics is often ignored in China’s business education. While well researched in the USA, this topic is rarely studied in China.

What are the economic and moral connections between Wall Street and the overall economy? How did we arrive, this point in history where our most powerful financial institutions thwart rather than promote free markets, prosperity, and even social cohesion? Can the fractured relationship between Wall Street and Main Street be repaired? Wall Street Values chronicles the transformation of Wall Street's business model from serving clients to proprietary trading and explains how this shift undermined the ethical foundations, modern financial industry. Michael A. Santoro and Ronald J. Strauss argue that post-millennial Wall Street is not only “too big to fail” but also a threat to the economy even when it succeeds. They describe how, more than a year before the government acknowledged the financial crisis, Wall Street icon Goldman Sachs saved itself by misleading its clients and impeding the information flow needed for the efficient functioning of free markets, thereby prolonging the mortgage bubble and adding to the financial and human cost, crisis. They also present a nuanced critique, government's role not only for the economic miscalculations leading to financial deregulation but also for failing to check the irrational exuberance of 2007 and 2008. Looking to the future, Santoro and Strauss make a compelling case for vigorous government enforcement, Dodd-Frank Act, face of Wall Street's opposition. They also argue, however, that effective government regulation is not enough; economic prosperity will be sustainable only if Wall Street professionals themselves begin an urgently needed conversation about their values and business ethics. © Michael A.

The traditional ethics of medicine was a teleological ethics predicated on the assumption that the goal of medicine was to prolong life and promote better health. But, as bioethicists have made plain, these are not the only or even the overriding goals of most patients. Most of us have goals and values that limit our desire for medical treatments. Similarly, the view of the stockholder in business ethics is that the stockholder has only one interest - profit. If stockholders have no other values or interests that would limit their desire for additional profit, their sole interest is in profit maximization. But investors are real people with interests and values that balance and limit their desire for profit. It would be an extremely odd individual who cared for nothing except more profit. And institutional investors are supposed to serve the interests of individual investors. Stockholders hold many stakes in the firms in which they invest. The conclusion that most stockholders have interests that would limit the pursuit of maximum profit has significant implications both for business ethics and for the management of for-profit corporations. Something like ""informed consent for investors"" is needed. Corporate managers, to the extent that they are to be agents of their stockholders, must not simply pursue profit maximization. They must ascertain the interests and values of their investors that limit the single-minded pursuit of profit. © Springer 2009.","Bioethics; Corporate management; Informed consent; Stakeholder theory; Stockholder; Stockholder theory; Stockholder values",

The results, from a sample of 230 upper-level undergraduate students, indicated that simply taking a business ethics course did not have a significant influence on students' views regarding cheating. On the other hand, Machiavellianism was positively related to perceiving that two forms of cheating were acceptable. Moreover, in testing for moderating relationships, the results indicated that the extent to which taking a business ethics course influenced attitudes varied substantially across individuals. Specifically, taking a course in business ethics did result in students who scored lower on Machiavellianism holding even more negative views regarding certain forms of cheating. In addition, individuals with higher grade point averages (GPAs) who had taken a course in business ethics were also less accepting of certain forms of cheating than individuals with similar GPAs who had not taken the business ethics course.

The Global Compact is not an instrument that businesses must compulsorily adopt nor does it pursue the objective of imposing a new regulatory framework. On the contrary, the Global Compact is a set of values and Principles proposed by the United Nations that businesses must voluntarily decide to impose upon themselves.

Does the stratospheric growth of users consuming digital UGC imply quality enhancement of one's social circle? Is UGC a gold mine for the users who are looking for the social relationship? Or is UGC really an economic gold mine for business, but actually dross for social experiences? The interplay between business interests and user's social interests are important to forecast UGC's business impact in the long run. To answer some of these questions, we investigated the number of followers a typical Twitter user can attract by following 2000 other randomly chosen Twitter users. The followers attracted over a 50-day period in fall 2009 are documented and analyzed. Our preliminary result discovered the real number of followers who are not commercially originated, e.g. marketers or spammers, is about 2%, much lower than anticipated. It implies Twitter is hijacked as an economic platform for business rather than for social activities. If most followers are marketers or spammers, the social impact is probably much less than what is commonly perceived. On the other hand, the 'followings' of typical Twitter users have much lower number of marketers or spammers; therefore, Twitter still affords a positive user experience by tapping into UGC. Our study paves the way to understand the asymmetric impact of followers vs. followings on users.

Graves had already pointed out that research on social and financial performance was replete with difficult obstacles: (1) Social performance is hard to measure directly; proxy measures, such as social expenses, are more observable but are not necessarily desirable antecedents of social performance. (2) The link between social and financial performance is mediated by many factors; this link could be embedded in a complex causal web in which the company's response to social issues comprise only part of the relevant considerations.

This paper aims at setting the foundations and testing a deterministic model of fraud detection, following a study made on the financial statements belonging to a sample of 65 quoted organizations, guided by the classification of financial fraud made by the international standards on auditing. The financial auditor resorts to diagnosis analysis in order to identify, using specific indicators, errors, inconsistencies, accounting manipulations that may represent a basis of fraud. This has lead to testing, within this paper, the existence of interdependencies between a series of ratios (independent variables) and the financial frauds that may occur within a company. Therefore, the most representative ratios have been selected, for building a mathematical model (score function) that would provide the financial auditor with information necessary for fraud detection.","Auditing standards; Discriminant analysis; Fraud","Crime; Discriminant analysis; Knowledge management; Mathematical models; Standards; Deterministic modeling; Financial crisis; Financial security; Financial statements; Fraud; Global economies; Independent variables; International standards; Finance"

Today, the Global Compact provides the most far-reaching initiative worldwide to catalyse a voluntary participation of multinational corporations (MNCs) in corporate social responsibility activities (Arevalo and Fallon 2008, Kell and Levin 2003, Kell and Ruggie 1999, Leisinger 2007). The Compact offers a platform for businesses to advance ten Principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption (Kell 2005, Williams 2004). The core tasks of the Global Compact are to mainstream these principles in global business activities and to facilitate cooperation among those constituents who are willing to create multi-stakeholder engagement. Unlike certification-based initiatives (e.g. SA 8000), the Compact has no intention to enforce or even measure the behaviour of firms participating in the initiative. The Global Compact rather intends to bring together a variety of different actors to discuss, learn about and advance its underlying principles (Kell 2005, Kell and Levin 2003, Rasche 2009b, Ruggie 2001, 2003, Williams 2004). Against this background the Global Compact can be considered as a strategic policy initiative for business focusing on the implementation of its ten Principles and the promotion of broader UN goals (Rasche 2009a). © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,

However, in the fourteen years since the international furore raised by Shell's attempt to sink the Brent Spar rig in the North Sea and its alleged collusion with the Nigerian government in ignoring the rights of the Ogoni people, multinational extractive firms have arguably come a long way in reforming their CSR performance. Today, in response to activist – and increasingly investor – pressure, nearly all the global oil and mining companies have a CSR programme in place and seem committed to environmental stewardship and human rights. In fact many take part in international voluntary initiatives like the UN's Global Compact. And while debate may still rage in some corporate circles about the linkage between CSR and profitability, indeed CSR has become a prerequisite for business sustainability in the extractive industry, where a reputation for corporate citizenship could arguably make the difference between winning or losing multi-million dollar concessions.However, in spite of the ever-ratcheting levels of corporate accountability that activist pressure has spurred in the extractives sector, we observe that many companies still struggle to gain and maintain their social licenses to operate. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,

This is not just about being ‘green’, but about exploring the full range of socially responsible behaviours. As Theodore Zeldin suggested in his book An Intimate History of Humanity: ‘The Green Movement could not become a major political force so long as it concerned itself primarily with natural resources rather than with the full range of human desires. Its setbacks are yet another example of idealism being unable to get off the ground because it has not looked broadly enough at human aspirations in their entirety’.

Despite their different histories and organizational structures, their strategic positioning as a mutually reinforcing ‘value platform’ appears to have been successful. Separately, they have achieved pre-eminence in their respective fields. Together, they are increasingly widely used by companies to report their corporate responsibility goals, policies and performance. Looking ahead over the next decade, however, it is clear they will not achieve their respective missions without directly addressing a range of criticisms. These include that they are neither broad enough in terms of users, nor deep enough in terms of measurable impacts and accountability. There are also issues about the sustainability of their respective business models. In many respects, however, their shortfalls are not of their own making. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,

Spread across regions and entire continents, the various Global Compact Networks offer each other support, exchange and a link between the central Global Compact Office in New York, at UN Headquarters, and the individual company committed to the Global Compact's ten Principles. When Kofi Annan envisioned it, the Global Compact started as an initiative without long-term plans concerning its operational structure. As it gained momentum, it became clear that the Global Compact Office in New York could hardly cater to all the different participants worldwide. Companies were joined by hybrid and civil society organizations in their effort to promote the ten Principles; characteristics differed starkly between the different business participants. Locality, sector, size and ownership structure create a variety of challenges; at times the only real connecting component was the commitment to the Global Compact itself. Thus, local support structures started to develop. Some were initiated by the United Nations itself, some grew from self-organized groups of signatories to the Global Compact, and others joined existing initiatives in the field of corporate responsibility. Over the last five years, these Local Networks started communicating and comparing their respective organizational structure and related problems, their output and assumed impact. With the Annual Local Networks Forum (ALNF) bringing together representatives from networks around the world - so-called Focal Points - a platform was created to streamline and coordinate these new structures and ensure their connection to other Global Compact entities. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,

It also considers what conclusions can be drawn both for future policy and for the conduct of future academic research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper overviews existing literature and summarises the main findings, focusing particularly on some topics deemed important and interesting for directing future research. Findings: The paper finds that while the neoclassical approach to finance has evidently failed there is currently little consensus on how to replace it. This opens up the possibility of debate, new avenues for research and ultimately radical change. Practical implications: The paper argues that more interactions between academic and finance practitioners are needed. Research in finance should be interdisciplinary or embed the insights from other disciplines and it should put behavioural finance under mainstream attention. The teaching of management and finance should also be more informed by issues of ethics, politics, social corporate responsibility, distribution of wealth and power and it should stimulate more critical and creative thinking. Social implications: The authors argue that capitalism works well only when it is adequately regulated and when there is a solid mechanism of balancing and counterbalancing of powers among the major players. The paper therefore calls for a ""democratisation"" of capitalism, to stop the trend of growing global inequality and reverse the existent plutocratic capitalism. Originality/value: The paper outlines several viewpoints and interpretations of the financial crisis taken from the extant literature and hence offers a reflection on several dimensions that shaped the crisis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioural accounting; Economics; Finance; Monetary policy",

Responsible sourcing, also referred to as supply chain responsibility, is a voluntary commitment by companies to take into account social and environmental considerations when managing their relationships with suppliers. This strategy is now an integral part of effective supply chain management. Responsible sourcing practices contribute to efficiency and continuity of the supply chain in the long run. As production chains expand, companies of all sizes and sectors are devoting more efforts to managing supply chain risks and building effective supplier relationships. Improving social and environmental performance in production chains is becoming a major element of this process. As experience has shown, one bad incident with one supplier can lead to a disproportionate amount of adverse publicity, damaging a company's reputation and brand image. This has led a growing number of companies to develop and promote responsible sourcing practices. Indeed, effective supply chain management is a way for businesses to build a competitive advantage, especially in sectors where production is largely outsourced, such as clothing, footwear, electronics, or food products. For many companies, working towards improving social and environmental standards in the supply chain has become a natural extension of their commitment to corporate responsibility and, as such, forms part of their overall business model. © The Evian Group 2010.",,

As with software design, the design of our organization can benefit from deliberate improvement efforts, but those efforts must have a purpose, and must serve the broad community of stakeholders that affect, or are affected by, the organization. Refactoring to agile and lean organizations demands that we have a shared vision of what the refactoring needs to achieve, and that we optimize the organization around the people doing the work. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","agile; artful making; Jazz; lean; metaphor; organization design; organization patterns; refactoring; stakeholder; stakeholder management","Agile manufacturing systems; Design; agile; artful making; Jazz; lean; metaphor; Organization design; organization patterns; Refactorings; stakeholder; Stakeholder management; Software design"

Design/methodology/approach – The study employs semi-structured interviews with key informants accompanied by site observations. Key informants include chief operating officers, environmental managers and accounting directors of three pulp and paper companies in Thailand. Findings – The study identifies the root causes of the barriers: lack of building organizational learning, a narrow focus on economic performance and absence of guidance on environmental management accounting. Research limitations/implications – As an exploratory case study, findings cannot necessarily be extrapolated to broader populations. To improve the generalization of the findings, future research should broaden the sample. It would also be beneficial to pursue comparative research between industries, countries and regions. Practical implications – Developing environmental management accounting requires increasing “green” knowledge and generating a wider conception of corporate responsibility throughout an organization. In addition, government agencies have to play a significant role in promoting environmental management accounting. Originality/value – This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the influence of organizational learning mechanisms and the role of governments in developing environmental management accounting. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic performance; Environmental management; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Thailand; Workplace training",

Design/methodology/approach: Conceptual and strategic thinking on the subject. Findings: Over the past decade, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability have become hot topics right across the business world. Changes in legislation, pressure from consumers and concern for reputation have forced even the most reluctant of managers to address the impact of business on the environment. As a result, reporting on sustainability has risen enormously: one hundred percent of the FTSE companies now mention it on their corporate website. But despite all this increased attention, a great number of executives are still unclear on precisely what the word sustainability means. Common concerns include how it relates to CSR, how it fits with business initiatives that are already in place and, of course, how it impacts the bottom line. As yet, there are no established standards, and definitions of the term are loose and subjective. Whereas one company may be overhauling its business models and processes in a real commitment to green practice, another interprets a sustainable business as a company that will survive the next ten years. So how can we find some common ground? What do we know about sustainability by now, and what do we still need to learn? Practical implications: Offers practical advice for anyone considering sustainability and suggests areas for further and research. Social implications: Calls for tougher definitions and increased practice of corporate sustainability in order to benefit society and the environment as well as business. Originality/value: Explains some of the complexities of the current buzzword in business, offering advice to any manager interested in sustainability. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business planning; Corporate strategy; Innovation; Organizations; Performance measures; Sustainable development",

We explain why this sort of behavior unlocks additional potential for value creation, as well as the conditions that either facilitate or disrupt the value-creation process. Firms that manage for stakeholders develop trusting relationships with them based on principles of distributional, procedural, and interactional justice. Under these conditions, stakeholders are more likely to share nuanced information regarding their utility functions, thereby increasing the ability of the firm to allocate its resources to areas that will best satisfy them (thus increasing demand for business transactions with the firm). In addition, this information can spur innovation, as well as allow the firm to deal better with changes in the environment. Competitive advantages stemming from a managing-for-stakeholders approach are argued to be sustainable because they are associated with path dependence and causal ambiguity. These explanations provide a strong rationale for including stakeholder theory in the discussion of firm competitiveness and performance.

I contrast one author's Post-Westphalian political approach to the human rights responsibilities of transnational corporations (TNCs) with my own ""Fair Share"" theory of moral responsibility for human rights. I suggest how the debate about the meaning of corporate human rights ""complicity"" might be informed by the fair share theory. While I point out that Post-Westphalians and moral philosophers may have fundamental disagreements about basic concepts such as legitimacy, justice, and democratic deliberation, I conclude that the Post-Westphalians have made a major contribution to the expansion of the field by presenting business ethicists with an opportunity to inform and guide debates about the potential future course of transnational governance. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

This timely book directly addresses a central question: is it that the existence of an ethical or an unethical climate influences behaviour, or, does the presence or absence of a moral character and personal values have the greatest influence on behaviour at work? Drawing on an empirically derived study and over thirty years of experience in both the public and private sectors, Hemingway proposes four modes of individual moral commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability: The Active Corporate Social Entrepreneur, the Concealed Corporate Social Entrepreneur, the Conformist and the Disassociated. Hemingway posits that the Conformists represent the majority of people in organisations, adhering to the prevailing ethical climate, whatever that might be.

The present paper is motivated by such a viewpoint and aims to investigate gender-based differences in the ethical disposition and the underlying dimensions in ethical decision-making processes, by specific examination of business students. Design/methodology/approach: The main research instrument is a quantitative questionnaire through which the responses of 162 business students (45 females and 117 males) are examined. For data analysis univariate analysis by invoking one-way analysis of variance and multivariate approach using cluster analysis are conducted to investigate gender-based differences in the ethical disposition. To determine the underlying dimensions in ethical decision-making processes, for female and male business students, the principal axis approach to factor analysis has been used. Findings: The findings provide evidence that female business students are more ethically predisposed than their male counterparts. It is further observed that males exhibit less diversity in ethical decision making while females more readily invoked different ethical dimensions for different business scenarios. Originality/value: The paper offers valuable insight into the role of gender in ethics in the context of Indian business. The fact that females appear to demonstrate greater sensitivity on ethical issues suggests that practitioners may want to use this knowledge for developing their organizational strategies, ethical codes, and evaluation systems. Further, the study also highlights the importance of realigning the curriculum in a manner that the teaching of ethics becomes an integral part of business school education. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Decision making; Ethics; Gender; India; Students",

Four types of high-leverage finance capitalism are considered: hedge funds; private equityleveraged buyouts; high-leverage, subprime mortgage banking; and high-leverage banking. The structurally related problems with the four types of high-leverage finance capitalism converged in something of a perfect economic storm. Explanations for the crisis are offered in the context of the type of the high-leverage finance capitalism system that permitted and facilitated the economic crisis. Ethics issues and potential reforms are considered that may be able to mitigate the destructive effects of what Schumpeter referred to as the """"creative destructive"" effects of evolutionary forms of capitalism while realizing the Aristotelian economic ideal of creating wealth in such a way as to make us better people and the world a better place. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

While the papers in the 2009 special issue of Business Ethics Quarterly explore the political role of corporations I argue that they lack a sophisticated analysis of power across institutional and actor networks. The argument that corporate engagement with deliberative democracy can enhance the legitimacy of corporations does not take into account the effects of institutional, material and discursive forms of power that determine legitimacy criteria. As a result corporate versions of citizenship mediate versions of social responsibility and morality, which are reflected in the institutional and political economic norms that are produced by this power/knowledge. In order to overcome the limits of corporate social responsibility there is a need to develop more democratic forms of global governance of corporations. A radical revisioning of democratic governance would also need to overcome the limits posed by sovereignty and would require new forms of multi-actor and multi-level translocal governance arrangements in an attempt to create forms of power that are more compatible with the principles of economic democracy. © 2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

This is an important consideration for business ethics because it implies that justice and ethical behavior are naturally occurring phenomena independent of system controls or individual self-interest. To date, research on the deontic model and third-party reactions to injustice has focused primarily on individuals' tendency to punish transgressors. This research has revealed that witnesses to injustice will consider sacrificing their own resources if it is the only way to sanction an observed transgressor. In this paper we seek to extend this model by arguing that punishment may not be the only ""deontic"" reaction, and that in fact, third-party observers of injustice may engage in moral self-regulation that would lead them to conclude that the most ethical response is to do nothing. We provide preliminary evidence for our propositions using voiced cognitions data collected during a resource allocation task.

Moral imagination is a process of thinking that relies on practical intuition, self-reflection, and moral ideals to reconcile the identified incentives and incentive conflicts.

First, I will provide an overview of the many different uses of the charge of exploitation in business practice through an examination of the uses of the term in the literature on sweatshop labor. Second, I will discuss which of these senses of exploitation are defensible as identifying clear moral wrongs that take place in the context of business and, specifically, sweatshop labor. Third, I will apply the lessons learned from my exploration of exploitation in sweatshop labor to other specific areas of business. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

The recent development of dramatically expanded global supply chains has resulted in social and environmental problems upstream that are attributable at least in part to downstream marketers and consumers. Marketers have responded mainly by using corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication to counter the critique of CSR practice, but these claims of ethical corporate behavior often lack credibility and can result in a backlash against brands. The article argues that more adequate attention to the harmful upstream effects of downstream marketing and consumption decisions requires greater attention to stakeholder marketing and marketer efforts to help create responsible consumers. It concludes by identifying implications for further research in this important emergent area of marketing ethics. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

The credit crunch clearly demonstrated that trust is essential to the operation of the market. Goodwill is a glass of water that one fills drop by drop. One shock can make the glass fall and spill all trust. It will take time and effort to restore all the spilled trust. With regard to integrity, two general approaches can de distinguished. The American approach is rule based. The European approach is principle based. As a result of the latest financial crisis, major reforms will take place. The protection of integrity will play a predominant part in these reforms. The author strongly believes that also in Europe a strong shift towards a more rule based approach will be noticeable. Confidence will not be restored easily. With regard to business ethics the end of the last century shifted the stakeholders shifted from ""tell me"" to ""show me"". In the decade to come, we will most certainly see a shift towards ""prove me"". Financial institutions will have to prove that they are in control , including with regard to their integrity policy.

We use the method of critical genealogy to demonstrate that the norms that discourage lateral hiring are constructions used by powerful employers to control the turnover of their employees, making them subjects of their employer's power rather than free and autonomous people in their own right. We suggest instead that ethical responsibility for entertaining or rejecting lateral hiring offers rests with the focal employee(s). We conclude that the form and symmetry of loyalty between employees and their current employers are the determinants of the appropriateness of an employee's decision to entertain and accept outside offers. These conclusions imply responsibilities for employers to forge (and employees to honor) symmetrical relational loyalty in the workplace, but not for alternate employers to refrain from making lateral hiring offers. ©2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

We found that, compared to benefits, allocating burdens intergenerationally increased concern with one's legacy, heightened ethical concerns, intensified moral emotions (e.g., guilt, shame), and led to feelings of greater responsibility for and affinity with future generations. We argue that, because of greater concern with legacies and the associated moral implications of one's decisions, allocating burdens leads to greater intergenerational generosity as compared to benefits. Our data provide support for this effect across a range of contexts. Our results also indicate that the differential effect of benefits versus burdens in intergenerational contexts depends on the presence of two important structural characteristics that help enact concerns about legacies, including (1) future impact of decisions, and (2) a self-other tradeoff. Overall, our findings highlight how considering resource valence brings to the fore a number of key psychological characteristics of intergenerational decisions-especially as they relate to legacies and ethics. © 2010 Business Ethics Quarterly 20:1 (January 2010); ISSN 1052-150X.",,

The authors compare international successful stock markets systems such as the US and the UK with successful stakeholder systems such as Japan, Germany, and most of continental Europe. Design/methodology/approach-The issue of the banks’ compatibility to support the stakeholder’s interests is examined by two separate questionnaires designed and tested for the issues of reliability and validity. The questionnaires are addressed to two groups in the banking industry: corporate loan managers; and finance directors. Findings-The findings show that finance directors share with the corporate loan managers the concerns of corporate stakeholders’ interests and the importance of shareholders and creditors as complementary sources of financing. Regarding the stakeholders’ effects on banks performance, the results show that: banks’ support to shareholders interests is positively associated with banks profitability and liquidity, banks support to suppliers’ interest is positively associated with banks’ profitability, capital adequacy, and asset quality, banks’ support to the creditors’ interest is positively associated with bank’s liquidity. Banks’ support to unions, suppliers, and government relations is positively associated with bank’s liquidity, and banks’ support to corporate employees and managers is positively associated with bank’s asset quality. Overall, the results conclude that banks’ performance is positively associated with their orientations toward fulfilling corporate stakeholders’ interests. Research limitations/implications-The findings are limited to the banking industry in the UK only.

A key difference between Internet shopping malls and online open marketplaces lies in the level of responsibility they assume for quality assurance, payment, transportation, and returns/refunds. Online open marketplaces offer only a secure trading environment for sellers and buyers, who must take charge of their transactions. Thus, the role of trust in online open marketplaces is more critical to successful business strategies than in Internet shopping malls. Open marketplaces have been developing and implementing a wide range of policies and mechanisms to build trust because such activities represent one of the most critical factors influencing sustainable business activities. Through a comparative study employing content analysis and a number of Korea's leading companies, we examine trust-building policies and mechanisms and investigate the implications for practitioners and theorists.

One relevant development of classical game theory, Generalized Game Theory (GGT), entails its extension and generalization through the formulation of the mathematical theory of rules and rule complexes. Social theory concepts such as norm, value, belief, role, social relationship, and institution as well as game can be defined in a uniform way in terms of rules and rule complexes. Among the applications, one major initiative has been the conceptualization of fuzzy games and equilibria. In this paper a GGT model of 2-person fuzzy bargaining games is outlined. Two key concepts are applied: (1) players' value (or ""utility"") structures consisting of ideal points or expectation levels, on the one hand, and limits of acceptance, on the other; (2) fuzzy judgment functions in which players deal with imprecise information and use approximate reasoning in making decisions and negotiating agreements. Such fuzzy judgment functions can take into account economic, socio-psychological, and cultural and institutional aspects of the bargaining context, which affect the bargaining process in specifiable ways. Several significant results are obtained from the application of this model: the opportunities (or not) for agreement, the participants' satisfaction levels with an agreement, and the question whether or not the agreed ""price"" is an equilibrium price. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agreement; Equilibrium price; Fuzzy satisfaction judgment; Game; Negotiation space",

It argues that the informal trade fulfilled various functions for such consumers, both as buyers and sellers: clothing could be sold to raise cash quickly and bought at a cheap price, while the informal trade may also have reinforced local community networks and other social relationships. Design/methodology/approach - The paper focuses on the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire to provide a case study that highlights any differences in informal networks arising out of geographical variations. Documentation for the informal trade has been gathered from records of court cases and newspaper reporting of criminal trials involving stolen clothing. Findings - The informal trade in clothing involved everyday, ordinary clothing, usually sold for money, but often for goods in kind and/or social credit. The trade operated over all areas of the two counties and seems to have been an important method for acquiring cheap clothing where retail provision was not yet fully developed to cater for all social classes. Originality/value - The link between all facets of retailing is highlighted, as is the importance of placing informal trading networks within their local retailing environment. Their success relied on participants’ knowledge about the goods, on trust in each other and often on expectations of mutuality. The informal trade was an important strategy for working-class clothing acquisition in both rural and urban areas. The trade in illicit clothing formed a large proportion of the informal trade, and its analysis also sheds light on the informal trade in licit clothing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business history; Clothing; Consumer behaviour; England; Retailing; Theft",

This theme is particularly relevant given the large number of firms that are family-owned. Also the implicit potential of innovation to reconcile corporate sustainability aspects with profitability justifies an extended analysis of this link. Governments often support socially beneficial innovation with various policy instruments, with the intention of increasing international competitiveness and simultaneously supporting sustainable development. In parallel, firms pursue corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental management activities partly in the hope that this will foster such innovation in their organisation (alongside their main aim of improving CSP). Hence, the main research question of this article is about the association of CSP with innovation with high social benefits and the determinants of the potential moderation of this association. Based on panel data, the article analyses the link between CSP and innovation, and the effect of being a family firm using panel estimation techniques. The results point to a moderating role of family firms on the link between innovation with high social benefits and CSP.

Each of these academic communities has its own preferred publication outlets, suggesting a potentially problematic bifurcation of business ethics scholarship. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Academic community; Business ethics scholars; CSR; Journal quality; Ranking; Survey",

However, it is still not clear when different community engagement strategies are appropriate or how such strategies might benefit the firm and community. In this review, we examine when, how and why firms benefit from community engagement strategies through a systematic review of over 200 academic and practitioner knowledge sources on the antecedents and consequences of community engagement strategy. We analytically describe evidence on the rise of the community engagement strategy literature over time, its geographical spread and methodological evolution. A foundational concept underlying many studies is the 'continuum of community engagement'. We build on this continuum to develop a typology of three engagement strategies: transactional, transitional and transformational engagement. By identifying the antecedents and outcomes of the three strategies, we find that the payoffs from engagement are largely longer-term enhanced firm legitimacy, rather than immediate cost-benefit improvements. We use our systematic review to draw implications for future research and managerial practice. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Citizens; Community engagement; Community groups; Corporate philanthropy; Social partnerships; Social strategy; Stakeholder engagement; Systematic review",

This study focuses on the firm's internal stakeholders - i.e. its employees - and the extent of their involvement in the selection of social campaigns. Whilst the difficulties of managing a firm that has lost or damaged its legitimacy in the eyes of its employees are well known, little is understood about the extent to which managers and their social partners listen to and involve their employees in the legitimation process. Through telephone interviews with non-profit organisations and senior managers of service sector firms, the extent of employee involvement in CRM campaigns and the perceived benefits of doing so are investigated. Amongst other things, we find that (i) the extent of employee participation varies significantly across firms; (ii) larger CRM campaigns tend to be managed centrally with relatively less employee participation than smaller ones and (iii) financial services firms are more likely to make CRM decisions centrally, with relatively less employee participation than retail services firms. © Springer 2009.","Cause-related marketing; Corporate social responsibility; Employee participation; Human resource management; Organisational legitimacy; Social alliance; Stakeholder engagement",

In any value-creating endeavour, management needs to effectively understand the dynamic features of value systems of the firm. The proposition in this paper is that the singular, monistic and short-term oriented shareholder perspective fails to capture the dynamics of value management from the standpoint of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. In this article we provide a new characterisation of stakeholder value in terms of four constructs: interdependency, mixed-tangibility, temporality and commitment-intensity. Based on this characterisation, we propose a new conceptual model - stakeholder value cycle model (SVCM) - for stakeholder value management. This research seeks to improve the understanding of the dynamics of stakeholder values by increasing our knowledge of how the strategic decisions, systemic leverage, resources and the new characteristics of stakeholder value impact value systems of a firm.

A corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy is beneficial not only for a corporation's bottom line but also for its employees, stakeholders, consumers, and for communities, the environment and society at large. It is, therefore, imperative to assess and know the extent to which a corporation is socially responsible. Keeping this in view, the present paper seeks to introduce a new measure, based on a holistic and system modelling approach, to conceptualise and measure the phenomenon of corporate social responsibility. It develops, constructs and validates a model to measure CSR by using a latent variable structural equations model within the certain boundaries of the organisational strategic planning systems. It will provide us with a measurement or index of corporate responsibility at international level, country level or community level. A CSR index will indicate the extent to which a particular corporation has social responsibility and in which areas it lacks such responsibility, if any. Strengths and weaknesses of various components of the model will also indicate characteristics at a certain level which will enable the corporation to pinpoint what exactly is required in order to improve its responsibility towards people, the environment and society at large. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Environment protection and sustainability; Ethics and human resources; Organisational strategic planning systems; Social accountability; Systems approach",

Questions as to how a company addresses safety concerns outside the standard work environment, the ethics of operating in a risky environment and the requirements for international consistency in compensation standards for loss of life were addressed. The authors argued that multinational companies should localize health and safety practices to address the important asymmetries between different regions of the world regarding social, cultural and infrastructural issues.

When we separate ethics from life, we put it beyond our daily reach, treating it as something that is meaningful only at certain moments. This problem permeates our everyday talk about ethics at work, in popular culture, in our textbooks, and even in our ethics codes. This book uses insights from the fields of communications and rhetoric to show how in the very framing of ethics-even before we get to specific decisions-we limit the potential roles of ethics in our work lives and in the pursuit of happiness. Sayings such as ""It's just a job"" and ""Let the market decide"" are two examples of demonstrating that our perspective on professional ethics is shaped and reinforced by everyday language. The standard ""bad apples"" approach to dealing with corporate and governmental wrongdoing is not surprising; few people are willing to consider how to cultivate ""the good orchard."" The book argues that ethics is about more than behaviour regulation, spectacular scandals, and comprehensive codes.

Several reasons for these closures are described and examined, including that: Starbucks overestimated their points of differentiation and the perceived value of their supplementary services; their service standards declined; they ignored some golden rules of international marketing; they expanded too quickly and forced themselves upon an unwilling public; they entered late into a highly competitive market; they failed to communicate the brand; and their business model was unsustainable. Key lessons that may go beyond the specifics of the Starbucks case are the importance of: undertaking market research and taking note of it; thinking globally but acting locally; establishing a differential advantage and then striving to sustain it; not losing sight of what makes a brand successful in the first place; and the necessity of having a sustainable business model. © 2009 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.","Coffee; Global branding; International business; Service brands; Service quality; Starbucks",

Stakeholders must therefore rely on the trustworthiness of the organization to fulfill obligations in accordance to Phillips' principle of fairness (Business Ethics Quarterly 7(1), 1997, 51-66), particularly where low-power stakeholders may not be fully consenting (Van Buren III, Business Ethics Quarterly 11(3), 2001, 481-499).

This paper aims to explore the issues involved. Design/methodology/approach: A business relationship is an interactive exchange between two organizations embedded in a network of business connections. The paper reviews theories of social actions and social actors and the concepts of economic field and embeddedness to illustrate some social dimensions of business relationships. Findings: Social action and social actor theories emphasize that co-operation is always encumbered with conflicts, that consciousness about the relationship is fundamental for both strongly and weakly structured actors, and that actors (people involved in a business relationship) always have some freedom of manoeuvre. The concept of economic field underscores the specificity of each business relationship and the critical need for concrete analysis. The concept of embeddedness highlights that no business relationship is possible without personal bonds. Research limitations/implications: These are the first results of a deeper and broader research directed towards a conceptual model of business relationship management. Practical implications: The paper can help managers to analyze more deeply the social dimensions of business relations with both suppliers and buyers.

Scholars in the first camp are referred to as Habermasians, owing to their reference and adherence to the work of the German philosopher most famous for elaborating on the concept of moral discourse. To these scholars, moral engagement is marked by specific conditions of communication which ensure that this communication is uncorrupted by power differences and strategic motivations. Others - those called here Ethical Strategists - argue that the engagement of stakeholders must be integral to a firm's strategy if it is to achieve real success. This camp is characterized by scholars contending that the distinction between strategy and morality is not only unfortunate, but logically unnecessary. They hold that good strategy properly understood must encompass what are typically recognized as moral concerns, because the very purpose of the firm and the capitalist system within which it operates is, when viewed rightly, the creation of value for all stakeholders. While recognizing the important contributions made by the Habermasians to the conversation about stakeholder engagement, it is concluded that, owing to the confluence of conceptual and practical concerns, the Ethical Strategists' position is the more attractive. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and British Academy of Management.",,

These projects symbolically represent best practice for others to follow directly in the UK and through influence indirectly in other countries. This raises methodological challenges, yet the scant empirical attention given to this field justifies such attention. The main conclusion is that there have been improvements, yet these seem not to have been continuous. Contractors are distant from direct value creation, increasingly relying upon others in the supply chain. Improvement measures have not penetrated most supply chains. This suggests that contractors need to develop learning and competency capacity; especially stakeholder management and/or clients need to identify new solution providers. There has been little direct evidence of this and the current environment is placing emphasis upon price rather than value. Capacity and capabilities for continuous improvement appear largely transient and insufficiently embedded to persist where present. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Demonstration projects; Investment; Knowledge transfer Management; Performance improvement","Demonstration project; Demonstration projects; Knowledge transfer; Knowledge transfer Management; Performance improvements; Construction industry; Contractors; Demonstrations; Iron and steel plants; Knowledge management; Lubrication; Supply chain management; Supply chains; construction industry; industrial performance; investment; reform process; stakeholder; United Kingdom"

Product diversion is itself a serious concern for marketers, especially marketers of potentially dangerous products, such as tobacco, alcohol, firearms, and pharmaceuticals. These products may be sought and obtained by consumers who occupy illegal markets or are intent on using them for illegal purposes, leading to adverse consequences for other consumers, marketers, and society at large. Drawing on established marketing principles and accepted methods of forensic research, this article reports on a large-scale study of the diversion of handguns in the United States and the countermarketing and demarketing efforts of firearm marketers to safeguard against its occurrence through their distribution systems. The findings suggest that (1) significant diversion of handguns to illegal markets occurred in the United States during a recent period, (2) industry marketers varied widely in their use of safeguards against this diversion but, on average, engaged in few countermarketing and demarketing measures, and (3) the safeguarding efforts engaged in were found to reduce both diversion and its resultant crimes. The study and its findings provide an understanding of the nature and effects of firearm diversion and the use of countermarketing and demarketing safeguards to reduce its occurrence. The study also demonstrates the use of data and data collection methodologies from the legal process to inform questions about marketing, including controversial aspects of its practice.

Going over the edge between risk taking and unauthorized rogue trading is explained by looking at five inducements to escalate risk taking provided in the securities industry. This examination of financial edgework demonstrates how and, to a lesser degree, why rogue trading is a result of the security industry's pursuit of and desire to capitalize upon yet not publicize an occupational culture stressing a "" risk-and-win"" ethos. © 2010 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Within the latter view, knowledge is understood as a socially constructed and shared resource, and the focus is on the characteristics of the social relationships connecting the various actors and on the benefits these bring to the participants. Even though it is widely agreed that knowledge is essentially social by nature and that social capital does matter to the corporate bottom line, there are relatively few previous studies that have empirically examined the impact of social capital on organizational growth. To bridge this gap, the paper empirically examines how social capital residing in both intra-organizational and inter-organizational relationships of firms is related with organizational growth.

We have therefore investigated the relationship between the valuation of Euro corporate bonds and the standards of CSR of mainly European companies for the first time in this article. Generally, the debt market exhibits a considerable weight for corporate finance, for which reason creditors should basically play a significant role in the transmission of CSR into the valuation of financial instruments. Given that socially responsible firms are often regarded as economically more successful and less risky, they should have lower risk premia. The results of the empirical analysis, however, reveal that based on an extensive data panel the risk premium for socially responsible firms - according to the classification by SAM Group - was ceterius paribus higher than for non-socially responsible companies.

The concept of complicity has been of particular interest in this regard. This article explores the conceptual differences between silent complicity in particular and other, more ""conventional"" forms of complicity. Despite their far-reaching normative implications, these differences are often overlooked. Rather than being connected to specific actions as is the case for other forms of complicity, the concept of silent complicity is tied to the identity, or the moral stature of the accomplice. More specifically, it helps us expose multinational corporations in positions of political authority. Political authority breeds political responsibility. Thus, corporate responsibility in regard to human rights may go beyond ""doing no harm"" and include a positive obligation to protect. Making sense of this duty leads to a discussion of the scope and limits of legitimate human rights advocacy by corporations. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business and Human Rights; complicity; corporate social responsibility; duty to protect; human rights; human rights advocacy; silent complicity",

We argue that the special features possessed by financial accounting facilitate extreme narcissism in susceptible CEOs. In particular, we propose that extremely narcissistic CEOs are key players in a recurring discourse cycle facilitated by financial accounting language and measures. Such CEOs project themselves as the corporation they lead, construct a narrative about the corporation and themselves using financial accounting measures, and then reflect on how their accounting-constructed performance is perceived by stakeholders. We do not present empirical evidence about whether the use of accounting language and measures leads to unethical behaviour by extreme narcissistic CEOs - although the conclusions of Duchon and Drake (2009) suggest empirical support is probable. Rather, we focus on developing alertness to the potential for accounting, when engaged by an extremely narcissistic CEO, to be a precursor or implement of unethical behaviour. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","accounting; behaviour; chief executive officer; discourse; language; leadership; narcissism; psychology",

Little prior research examines this issue and the results are mixed. This paper is motivated by the lack of research on the impact of certified public accountings (CPAs) employment with former audit clients on auditor independence, particularly in the Asia Pacific region in the post-Enron climate. Design/methodology/approach: This research is the first study of its type in the literature using both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The framework of the study is formed by the identification of gaps in the literature and semi-structured interviews. Two within-subjects independent variables - ""auditors of different ranks"" (rank factor) and ""former auditor's direct prior professional relationship with the client"" - and one between-subject independent variable - ""Big 4"" CPAs vs non-Big 4 CPAs - are examined. Mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) are employed to analyze survey responses from 205 ""Big 4"" and 196 ""non-Big 4"" auditors. Findings: The rank factor has a significant influence on the perceptions of auditor independence. Perceived independence is impaired when a senior level professional such as partner or manager joins a former audit client, and revokes an US study conducted in the pre-Enron. Perceived independence is also impaired when the former auditor has a direct prior professional relationship with the former audit client. Results further indicate that when the former manager who has direct prior professional relationship with the client and then joins the audit client, independence is severely impaired. Originality/value: The results of this paper could help to establish an effective standard that deals with the employment/independence situations in the local auditing environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Auditing; Auditors; Business ethics; Employment; Hong Kong",

However, aspects of guanxi-related behaviours in the workplace are often misunderstood by Westerners with some going so far as to equate guanxi with forms of corruption. This study extends earlier study of Tan and Snell: 2002, Journal of Business Ethics41(December), 361-384) in its investigation of the underlying modes of moral reasoning in ethical decisions relating to aspects of guanxi, amongst Hong Kong managers. Managers' ethical judgements and underlying moral reasoning relating to a series of guanxi-related behaviours were recorded. Content analysis yielded categories that correspond with categories of moral reasoning described in Kohlberg's (1969, Handbook of Socialization Theory and Research, Rand McNally, Chicago, pp. 347-480) model. As hypothesised, it was found that harsher ethical evaluations of guanxi-related behaviours were positively correlated with the stage of moral reasoning. The most common types of reasoning were those corresponding to Kohlberg's stages four and five which relate to moral reasoning based on law and order, and on reason rather than emotion. Stage 6, concerned with more universalistic approaches to moral reasoning, was utilised considerably less, consistent with popularly held beliefs of the relativistic nature of Chinese ethics. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; chinese values; guanxi; moral judgment",

The reasons underlying the decision by management teams to engage in ethical communication are scarcely focussed on. Thus, grounded on legitimacy and stakeholder theory, this study analyses the views management teams in large listed companies have on communication of CSR. The focus is on aspects on interest, motives/reasons, users and problems related to corporate communication of CSR information. A questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews confirm that there is a distinct trend shift towards more focus on CSR in corporate communication. Whilst this trend shift started as a reactive approach initiated by the many corporate scandals, the trend shift is now argued to be of a proactive nature focussed at preventing legitimacy concerns to arise. These findings are significant and interesting, implying that we are witnessing a transit period between two legitimacy strategies. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the way respondents argue when it comes to CSR activities coincides with consequentialism or utilitarianism, i. e. companies engage in CSR activities to avoid negative impacts instead of being driven by a will to make a social betterment or acting in accordance with what is fundamentally believed to be right to do. This provides new input to the ongoing debate about business ethics. The findings should alert national and international policy makers to the need both to increase the vigilance and capacity of the regulatory and judicial systems in the CSR context and to increase institutional pressure to enhance CSR adoption and CSR communication. Furthermore, stakeholders need to be careful in assuming that CSR communication is an evidence of a CSR commitment influencing corporate behaviour and increasing business ethics. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate social responsibility; CSR communication; legitimacy; stakeholders; utilitarianism",

In a spirit akin to Husserl's 'bracketing' of metaphysics, when discussing ethical theories in business ethics, we can easily avoid metaphysics and use an approach that sees ethical theory as socially convincing normative narratives - narratives that unify us with others insofar as they describe our phenomenological experiences in a way with which many of us mutually resonate.

The empirical findings indicate that the processes involved in business ethics commitment have begun to be recognized and acted upon at an organizational level in Sweden. Some support is provided to show that codes of ethics are developing in some of Sweden's largest private and public sector organizations - although this is happening to a lesser extent in the public sector. It is noted that an effect of a code of ethics on the bottom line of the business was acknowledged by respondents in both private and public sector organizations. We believe that the supporting measures of business ethics commitment appear to be underutilized in both private and public sector organizations in Sweden (among those that possess codes of ethics), thus indicating that the commitment to business ethics in Swedish organizations has potential for future development. © 2010 The Authors.",,

It draws upon findings from an in-depth qualitative study of 19 women climbers and explores the concept of serious leisure from a gender perspective, arguing that in order to develop a more sophisticated understanding of serious leisure, it is important to situate participation in the social, cultural and political contexts that frame experience. Drawing on the theoretical work of Aitchison, Shaw and Wearing, we use a feminist theoretical approach that recognises both collective experiences of gender, focusing on inequality, as well as a post-structuralist engagement with difference and identities.

Numerous studies have documented certain aspects of the problem-high HIV prevalence rates, increasing numbers of orphans and vulnerable children, declining average life expectancy, and a high number of deaths among adults during their most productive years. Scholars have engaged in speculation about the possible impacts that this disease might have on social relationships, economic growth and development, and governance in both the near and the long terms. But these studies are only forecasts of possible futures, not data driven analyses. This study closely examines data available from two agencies in the Botswana civil service, the police and prisons services in an effort to assess, albeit indirectly, any impact that the HIV/AIDS crisis may have had on the workforce.

Thereby the realm of 'being-for', in which individuals are supported to take increased responsibility, is marginalized. The conclusion made is that not only do the demoralizing processes systematically produce moral distance between humans, which weakens individual spontaneous outbursts of sympathy to take increased moral responsibility, they also promise to release individuals from their moral ambivalence by declaring organised action morally indifferent.

The second, the intellectual dimension, defined as the programmatic profile expressed by its substantive content and provided references, is constituted in relational citation structures. With this analytical division in mind, we set out to research how the intellectual structure is conditioned by the social relationships among researchers, with a focus on the institutional analysis perspective in organizational studies in Brazil. For this purpose, we empirically evaluated the phenomenon from the convergence of the social network analysis with the scientometric analysis, seeking support for these analyses within the structurationist perspective of the institutional theory.

Two well-documented determinants of business ethics (gender and religiosity) were investigated as moderators of the nationality-business ethicality relationship. The major research finding is that, while statistically significant differences were found between the business-related ethicality of American survey participants and the business-related ethicality of the non-American survey participants, the magnitudes of the differences were not substantial.

Applying a methodology grounded in Socratic skepticism, Cicero synthesizes the Stoics and Aristotle to create his own moral theory. From this theory, we derive a Ciceronian set of recommended traits that make up a model business leader. Central to this model is the recognition that there are two lodestars in life, the beneficial and the honorable. The first directs each of us to attend to our personal happiness, and the second to our moral worth. In Cicero's view, the life of leading sizable associations is what best satisfies this dual imperative. The honor of a business leader is secured by the practice of four virtues: wisdom, justice, greatness of spirit, and seemliness. A leader properly seeks his/her own benefit by recognizing that success comes from the relationships he/she establishes and that he/she are more apt to cultivate these by being virtuous. Cicero is not so naïve as to fail to see that the beneficial and the honorable may come into tension, noting various examples from business to illustrate the dilemma. But he insists a businessperson can be ethical and prosper at the same time once he/she comprehends the social fellowship of humanity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","ancients; Aristotle; business ethics; Cicero; happiness; leadership; Stoics; virtue ethics",

Markets are emerging for a range of environmentally orientated products and services as societies move (or lurch) towards reducing impacts and adapt to changing conditions. National governments are actively formulating policy and providing investment to develop green economies as one of the responses to the global financial crisis. Many of the political and economic drivers have been focused at the international and national scale, and while critical for setting the national framework for development, it often neglects the key role that regions and localities can play in ecological modernization. This paper explores two regional case studies in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, that are initiating shifts towards networks of sustainable businesses and communities and offers recommendations for further policy development. The focus of this paper is on the evolving regional sustainability market and its relationship to other social institutions including governments, communities and the individual.

Particular attention is given to the postructuralist 'aesthetic return': the resurgence of interest in aesthetics as an ontological foundation for human being-in-the-world. The disordered individual-as-emergent-artist-and-artifact, who is at the centre of this 'aesthetic return', is then translated into the 'dis'-organization that is the firm. The firm is thus defined in terms of its primal sensory impact on the world. It invokes a myriad of aesthetic relations between its disorganized self and others: its essence resides within these relations; its power of being is determined by its ability to project a unified aesthetic ideal - a 'mirror fantasy'. The firm thus emerges as a style: where style is defined as an organizing - a sculpting - of aesthetic chaos. In order to achieve a grand style, the firm projects itself through time as a unified aesthetic ideal; as an ongoing work of art. The article concludes with a discussion of how this aesthetic theory of the firm relates to other accepted theories of the nature and purpose of business organizations. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Aesthetics; Postructural ethics; Style; Theory of the firm",

This image can enhance the firm's strategic position through internal and external differentiators from competitors - as the firm becomes a more preferred employer, partner and supplier, it results in enhanced employee motivation, cost savings, better reputation, and greater guest loyalty.

The objective is to determine which moral theories form the basis for CSR policies. Are they based on ethical egoism, libertarianism, utilitarianism or some kind of common-sense morality? In order to address this issue, I conducted an empirical investigation examining the relation between moral theories and CSR policies, in companies engaged in CSR. Based on the empirical data I collected, I start by suggesting some normative arguments used by the respondents. Secondly, I suggest that these moral arguments implicitly rely on some specific moral principles, which I characterise. Thirdly, on the basis of these moral principles, I suggest the moral theories upon which the CSR policies are built. Previous empirical studies examining the relation between philosophical moral theories and the ethical content of business activities have mainly concentrated on the ethical decision-making of managers. Some of the most prominent investigations in that regard propose that managers mainly act in accordance with utilitarian moral theory (Fritzsche, D. J. and H.

In order to push the understanding of ethical consumption forward, we draw on what is known about the intention-behaviour gap from the social psychology and consumer behaviour literatures and apply these insights to ethical consumerism.

This paper aims to show that Drucker was just the opposite of unethical in his viewpoint regarding the behavior of managers and organizations, and that in fact much of his writings pointed to discourse-ethics-universalism and away from casuistic particularism. Specifically, the paper seeks to analyze and contrast the ways in which US and European institutions take action (a ""transatlantic divide"") when management and society eventually reposition their stance on ethics, as forecast by Drucker. Design/methodology/approach: This is a comparative study emphasizing the main day-to-day perspectives of ethical issues in businesses and how they are handled in the USA and in Europe. This is complemented by references to what Drucker's position would be on those issues and how he would have shown that ""good ethics"" serves to ensure that entrepreneurial energies end up by serving society and not destroying it. Findings: The paper provides an insight about how change is successfully brought about in current management practices by adhering to discourse and right behavior as pointed out by Drucker. It suggests that leaders acting responsibly are intrinsically ethical and will transfer their individual positions into their organization. Research limitations/implications: The research primarily concentrates around the implications of Drucker's writings on the ""transatlantic divide"" and does not extensively explore how this relates to businesses in Asia and other areas outside the Western world. Practical implications: The paper displays a number of standards and guidelines that have been adopted by practitioners and thus provides an input for further applications. Businesses that have adopted Drucker's philosophies will find useful directions on how to connect them to other philosophical developments. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to reject claims that Drucker is an ""efficiency enthusiast"" pursuing ""global change in a manner that has little to do with minimal standards of human decency, to say nothing of democracy, much less of emancipation"". It proves that the changes and the repositioning required for the current economic situation need a full understanding of Drucker in all respects of his work. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business environment; Business ethics; Confucianism; Corporate social responsibility; Europe; United States of America",

Practical implications: All companies should pursue the governance structure that ensures the social values of the organization are aligned with those of the community; overall unique stakeholders' understanding of a healthy working environment should support sustainability; equal implementation of occupational, health and safety regulations for each state in Australia could contribute overcoming for much-needed occupational, health and safety improvement. Originality/value: The originality of the paper is in applying the framework for examining the environmental management system pertinence to the image of defined good corporate citizen.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a quantitative analysis and exploratory approach. It studies the CSR practices of 20 selected UK companies. The analysis of CSR policies is based on the global reporting initiative (GRI) guidelines. The analysis took a further step in examining the trends of earnings per share (EPS) of the selected companies. Findings: The findings revealed that out of the 20 selected companies, only four achieved all six guidelines as per the GRI. In regression analysis of the variables CSR and EPS, a very weak (causal) but positive relationship was evident (R2 = 0.147). Research limitations/implications: The study was applied to 20 selected companies in the UK. Future research should be extended to a larger sample in order to analyze the strength of the relationship between EPS and CSR. The study applied variables of CSR based on GRI. Other measures may reveal different insights. Practical implications: In the strategic sense, CSR investments are not just another business cost but are essential for a firm's continued survival in the ever increasingly competitive business world of today. This understanding is crucial as there is an escalation of concern by both society and corporations in the modern world. More so, it is increasingly and widely accepted that attempting to isolate business from society is unrealistic and that dichotomising economic and social objectives as distinct and competing is false.

Design/methodology/approach: Application of the insights from modernist authors' analysis of modernity as experienced by a human subject within professional organizations (Gombrowicz and Musil) and as responsible for proliferation of layers of reality (Eco), to contemporary practices of socialization. Findings: The conflict between the need to conform to the corporate culture and the temptation to subvert them for creative or destructive purposes results in production of a ""person without qualities,"" and in the rise of the contemporary form of hyperreal infantocracy, which requires sophisticated irony in order to deal with organizational practices. Research limitations/implications: Paying more attention to literary analysts of contemporary condition such as Gombrowicz, Musil, Eco, and Kundera will allow to understand paradoxes of contemporary organizing beyond the limits of traditional social sciences.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper summarises three well-documented cases of corporate malfeasance, simply and sequentially. Each is analysed separately. Findings: The paper finds, in each case, that once the concealed ""truth"" comes out, the companies are in a much worse position than if they had come clean when initially challenged. The generalised finding is that once pressures mount, what is intentionally concealed tends to become exposed, with unanticipated and powerful negative consequences. Practical implications: To minimise business risk, managers are well advised to refrain from doing things behind a veil of secrecy and, instead, opt for greater transparency. Since what is hidden seldom remains hidden, a ""policy"" of corporate transparency is often in their interest. The lesson is that when under public pressure, for whatever reason, facts, risks and relationships will out.

The research focuses on examining how EI abilities are enacted within team contexts and how these are associated with critical reflection and team processes associated with learning. Design/methodology/approach: A phenomenological approach to the investigation of EI abilities was adopted using a diary methodology to capture how EI abilities were enacted over a 14-week team project by 80 MBA students from a range of international backgrounds. Such an approach is advocated to offer insights into the internal processes by which social action is perceived ""in situ"". Findings: The two EI abilities, emotional awareness and emotional management, were found to influence the three critical reflection processes: problem analysis, theorising cause and effect relationships, and action planning, as well as processes associated with team learning including team identification, social engagement, communication and conflict management. Practical implications: EI may offer insights into how differences in the nature, direction and depth of critical reflection can occur in team learning contexts. Developmental initiatives that aim to improve the emotional abilities of team members may help individuals to better manage the emotional context of learning in teams. Originality/value: Despite the increasing recognition of the role emotions play in learning, very little is known to date about how differences in the way in which emotional information is processed within social learning contexts can influence critical reflection or other learning processes.

Design/methodology/approach: The study presents an analysis of 37 interviews from 17 beginning teachers across 18 workplaces. Analysis used an adapted version of Evans and colleagues' expansive-restrictive framework for evaluating workplaces, focusing on relational aspects. A matrix of congruence between individuals and their workplace is presented, highlighting the significance of personal networking. Findings: Although beginning teachers concluded that their workplaces were largely expansive, they also identified concerns regarding perceptions of support availability. Formal and informal support was recognized and the significance of outside school support, such as through the University Faculty, was noted even for teachers in post. Good ""matches"", differential engagement with the same workplace and similar agency in different workplaces were identified. Practical implications: The matrix of congruence is offered as a tool to researchers and teacher educators interested in understanding how support is experienced by novice professionals. The study highlights the utility of taking a personal network perspective to conceiving workplaces as not necessarily bounded by locality or normative practices. This could offer opportunities for discourse leading to greater engagement by professionals in their own learning.

The experiences of four Swedish companies in the textile and clothing industry (TCI) conducting sourcing in China are presented. Our findings show that sourcing in China is becoming both cost- and strategy-driven.

The primacy of shareholder interests in corporate-governance processes and managerial action is, however, a myth that justifies all sorts of managerial self-interest seeking and exploitation of particular stakeholder groups. What makes this myth particularly problematic-from the standpoint of fairness and corporate governance-is that not all nonshareholder stakeholders are equally situated with regard to their ability to secure fair treatment. In this article, I explore the ethical dimensions of board responsibilities to dependent stakeholder groups by first describing the differences between shareholders and nonshareholder stakeholders with regard to risk, examining why dependent stakeholders (stakeholders with legitimate and urgent claims, but no power) are particularly important from the standpoint of stakeholder risk, and discussing how stakeholder consultation might provide a partial fix to such problems. I will conclude with proposals for how boards can more faithfully discharge their ethical responsibilities to dependent stakeholder groups, and in so doing facilitate stakeholder involvement in corporate governance in ways that promote fairness in organization-stakeholder relationships. © 2010 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Maignan et al.'s (1999, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science27(4), 455-469) construct, including economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities was used. The main findings are: (a) contrary to what has been presumed in the literature, the discretionary dimension includes two factors: CC toward employees and toward community; (b) perceptions of CC explain 35% of unique variance of affective commitment; (c) the best predictors are perceptions of economic and legal CC and, mainly, perceptions of discretionary CC toward employees; (d) the perceptions of discretionary CC toward employees are significantly better predictors of affective commitment than are perceptions of economic, ethical, and discretionary CC toward the community; (e) perceived inconsistency of the several CC dimensions is detrimental to employees' affective commitment. The study questions the four-dimensional model of the CC construct as operationalized by Maignan et al., suggests that culture should be included as a moderating variable in future research, and stresses that affective commitment may decrease when employees perceive that their organizations act upon the several areas of CC inconsistently. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Affective commitment; Culture; Inconsistency between perceptions of corporate citizenship dimensions; Perceptions of corporate citizenship; Psychological climate",

The results show that the discourse about CSR in the annual reports has changed from a national and communitarian view of social responsibility (cf. a negotiated view of CSR) toward an international and individualistic view of social responsibility (cf. a self-regulating view of CSR).

This article approaches the issue from the perspective of team production, and will propose a new form of corporate governance: enlightened corporate governance, which takes into consideration the specific investments of employees. The article argues that, in addition to shareholders, employees also bear a residual risk which arises due to their specific investments. This residual risk presents a valid and legitimate basis for residual claims. In this way, employees can be seen as residual claimants due to the fact that their income depends upon a hazardous quasi rent. Therefore, this article will call on the fiduciary duty of board members to protect those employees who are exposed to such residual risks and may thus be vulnerable as a result. This leads to a fundamental change of perspective on the ""theory of the firm"" - a change which will adopt the theories of new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory in order to promote business ethics research. Against this background, enlightened corporate governance aims to follow the criterion of specific investments as a legitimate basis for residual claims. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the consequences for board members, and to promote the sharing of control and ownership.

The paper argues that companies can employ 'morality as a factor of production' by a differentiated business strategy of moral commitments. In this way, companies can not only considerably reduce their exposure to the undesirable risks of losing core business relationships with important stakeholders. But at the same time, businesses may increase their readiness to take desirable innovation risks that are pivotal for long-term value creation. Ultimately, the paper develops an argument for how companies can better live up to the role of being an agent of societal value creation, often articulated by concepts such as ""corporate social responsibility"" or ""corporate citizenship"". © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

Following this, the paper is to both stimulate discussions and encourage further thinking within this field. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses inductive reasoning and syllogisms, as a basis for conceptual metaphor theory and critical discourse analysis. Evidence gathered from structured and systematic literature reviews - supported by existing empirical data, anecdotal evidence, personal observations and experience is also used. Findings: In business, the doctrine of what is Halal, has culminated in the creation of ingredient brands and in some cases forms of co-branding. However, the Halal's full potential has yet to be harnessed and there remain areas of dissonance and misunderstanding. Reasons offered by the authors are that current applications of brand theory unnecessarily restrict the term Halal and presuppose that there is one interpretation of its meaning. Also, instead of current trends which focus on rate determining steps within functional marketing approaches per se, Halal's competitive advantage is of more significance when delivered via the tacit elements of strategy and management. Research limitations/implications: As a conceptual paper, research is limited at times by a lack of empirical data and attempts necessitating the exploration of wide-ranging cross-disciplinary sources and stakeholder engagements. Originality/value: Growing market interest suggests its significance to both Muslims and non-Muslims. Furthermore, whilst research reveals studies looking at ""meat and money"" (Halal meat and Islamic finance) centred on functional attributes and monolithic consumption, few explore Halal's figurative and brand elements amongst diverse audiences. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brands; Ethics; Islam; Marketing",

This theoretical model has eight premises. It begins with the fundamental premise that environmental change puts the planet at risk. Given that industry has a great impact on the environment and that society legitimates industry it is argued that industry has a duty to act. As the present situation appears to put the planet in jeopardy, there is a need for a new relationship between industry and the environment. It is argued that, although there should be a long-term radical reorientation, in the immediate short-term sustainable development should be the target. There is a need for a measurement system to assess industry's impact, but current accounting is inadequate for a variety of reasons (e.g., monetary dependence, capitalist orientation, business focus, reliance on neoclassical economics, numerical quantification, and technical accounting practices). There is thus a need for a new holistic accounting which captures corporate environmental impacts. Finally, it is argued that companies because of their stewardship function should report their environmental accounting to their stakeholders. There are several implications from the acceptance of this theoretical model for organisations and accountants. First, at the general level, given the severity of the environmental problems which face us, it would seem prudent for managers and accountants to take immediate action to address these threats. Second, the traditional accounting paradigm with its narrow focus on accounting numbers does not capture the environmental consequences of organisational activity. Third, as part of innovation and experimentation there is a continued need to explore potential alternative monetary and non-monetary valuation systems. Finally, the theoretical framework implies that as part of their discharge of their stewardship function organisations should disclose their environmental performance to stakeholders. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting for natural resources; Environmental accounting; Environmental accounting and reporting; Natural inventories; Theoretical model",

In this paper, stakeholders are defined in terms of who has a stake in an issue instead of who has a stake in a firm, and in so doing introduces the idea of an ""issue network."" Drawing on concepts familiar to the social movements (sociology) and interest groups (political science) literatures, I argue that members of an issue network can be identified as those with grievances, resources, or opportunities. To illustrate this argument, I consider the issue of land use in the western United States, showing how various environmental organizations might fit into such a land use network. I conclude with the INSPIRE model, which locates my argument in this larger model of stakeholder management currently being constructed in the stakeholder literature. Copyright © 2010 ASAC.

She was given the drug Demerol for the migraine symptoms and Phenergan for nausea. Complications with the administration of Phenergan ultimately resulted in Ms. Levine contracting gangrene, necessitating the amputation of her right arm. Ms. Levine sued the drug maker, Wyeth Pharmaceutical, in state court and prevailed. The lower court's decision was appealed by Wyeth to the state supreme court where the ruling was confirmed. Wyeth next appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which, to the surprise of many observers, affirmed the judgment of the state supreme court. At issue was the fundamental question of the ability of consumers to obtain redress against negligent manufacturers in state courts. Wyeth's arguments to the Court were based upon preemption: Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a drug (and its labeling) preempts the ability of injured consumers like Ms. Levine to recover in state courts despite years of precedent to the contrary. Ability to recover damages in state courts represents, perhaps, the most important safety net available to consumers injured by defective products. A ruling by the Supreme Court that FDA-approved labeling of pharmaceuticals preempts the reach of the state courts would have severely compromised the balance of power between consumers and producers. © 2010 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Included in our analysis, which is based on publicly available documents spanning over a period of almost six decades, are critical incidents in which moral disengagement tactics were applied in the decision-making process. We infer that the disengagement tactics applied by tobacco decision makers are indicative of what Schein and other organizational scientists describe as organizational culture. We equate the critical incidents to the espoused beliefs and values and underlying assumptions which comprise organizational culture and explain that the cultures of these two tobacco companies are not consistent with the stakeholder theory of management. We conclude that the critical incidents we analyze were immoral and the representatives were indeed accountable for these behaviors. From an organizational change perspective, we discuss how analyzing these critical incidents can serve to assess the extent to which an organizational culture is ethical. Furthermore, these critical incidents can be fed back to organizational decision makers and can then be used to initiate organizational changes. © 2010 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

The empirical results indicate a relatively minor importance of pre-existing social ties vis-à-vis communication quality and fairness for the development of trust. Contrary to widespread perceptions, pre-existing social ties do not appear to directly contribute to establishing trust with external alliance partners in Korea. Multiple explanations are offered for this unexpected finding. Instead, existing social relationships moderate the importance of fairness for trust formation.

The debate illustrates how previous studies have neglected this social aspect of mediation by tourist guides and partly absorbed it into the concept of cultural mediation. Empirical illustrations are offered from the context of small tourist group visitations to local villages in rural areas of Madagascar, where collective social norms still play an important role. A qualitative approach based on personal interviews with guides and on field trip experience and observation is employed. Empirical findings indicate that the inclination of the host society to welcome accompanied tourists is facilitated by the capacity of local guides to develop relatively strong social ties with the host society. It is suggested that the increased use of local guides with good social relationships with the local communities as against the mere employment of non- local accompanying guides working for centrally located tour operators can enrich the mutual experience quality in the encounter between visitors and hosts and support local sustainable development by enhanced local involvement. Implications for sustainable tourism practice are discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Developing countries; Local guides; Remote communities; Social mediation; Social ties; Sustainable development","developing world; ecotourism; social network; sustainable development; tourism development; village; Madagascar"

In Participatory Theatre, performative enactments are used to investigate the social arrangements that impede progressive change. Participatory Theatre opens up productive spaces for reflexivity and creates knowledge that is grounded in immediate experience and direct experiment. It is accomplished through an iterative process that involves action, reflection and action.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used in this paper was exploratory and qualitative, including the analysis of secondary data and semi-structured interviews. Findings: Using the New Zealand Auditor-General's best practice guidelines for a public sector audit committee as a benchmark, the paper finds that the DHB rates moderately well in terms of ""effectiveness potential"". However, factors are identified concerning the audit committee members' independence, competence, tenure, and remuneration, which impinge upon the overall effectiveness of the audit committee. Despite apparent shortcomings in these areas, the informal networks between audit committee members and management serve to maximise the ""realisation"" of what potential effectiveness exists. As a result, the audit committee is perceived by its stakeholders (management, auditors, and committee members) as being a valuable tool to assist the DHB board in achieving proper governance. Practical implications: There are no specific regulatory or legislative requirements for establishing audit committees in the New Zealand public sector.

Findings from this study show that all 15 selected CSFs are regarded as critical by most respondents for the success of stakeholder management in construction projects. The factor regarding social responsibilities is considered most important for managing stakeholders. Although correlations between CSFs and types of projects and organizations were statistically significant, these were not particularly strong. Also, even though there is a general consensus on the rankings of the CSFs among different respondents, the detailed pairwise comparisons actually show the existence of a few differences in perceptions on the relative importance of the CSFs. Therefore, the working priorities of project managers for managing stakeholders are context specific, depending on the nature, client sector, and cost of the project, and also on their organizations and management levels in the organization.

I contribute to the literature on corporate responsibility standards in general and SA 8000 in particular by showing (a) that attempts to standardise corporate responsibility can only be successful insofar as we recognise that compliance with SA 8000's rules requires a 'fresh judgement' every time they are applied, (b) that SA 8000 should not be pushed down the supply chain as such coercion does not require a truly responsible decision by suppliers and eventually leads to moral mediocrity and (c) that the necessarily time-consuming reflections about the singular contexts within which SA 8000 is applied challenge the urgent need for implementing this standard.

Narrative, with its focus on linear beginning, middle and end coherence, retrospection and monologic, is too easily appropriated into managerialist projects. We focus on the web of living stories as a Derridian deconstructive move, which allows us to say something important about their relation to narrative and to develop a storytelling ethics. Our thesis is that resituating the relationship between narrative and living story invites exploration of the plurality of narratives that treat living stories as supplementary. We claim that this deconstructive move allows us to rethink politics and ethics anew. Storytelling ethics opens new spaces for marginalized other(s) voices and creates an awareness of our complicity and responsibility for others.

We developed a model, which included visible, interaction and management elements that we proposed influenced the perceptions and experiences of stakeholders relating to the event effectiveness, strengths, weaknesses and improvements. Specifically, we used a modified version of Preble-s (2005) six-step multi-stakeholder assessment approach to examining the perceived overall effectiveness of the event. Fifty stakeholder interviews were conducted on-site and their opinions were content analysed. The key findings of the study were that the majority of the stakeholders perceived the event to be effective. Spectators perceived the strengths to be interaction components, and weaknesses and improvements to be visible elements such as track layout. Volunteers perceived strengths to be management related, but also noted that these were weaknesses and needed improvement. Lastly, Paid workers perceived interaction elements to be both strengths and weaknesses, and suggested that management elements could be improved. Important implications for similar motoring events were suggested.

However, all retailers are not equally affected by recessionary periods, with some viewing this time as an opportunity to invest and establish competitive advantage and others cutting back and waiting for the recession to pass. In the light of the current economic downturn, the purpose of this paper is to investigate retailers' strategic response to the downturn, and assess how these responses differ across different organisations in terms of size, geographic location, and sector of operation. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 50 (25 Australian, 25 New Zealand) managers associated with the retail sector (ranging from chief executive officers to store owners) were invited to participate in face-to-face interviews, resulting in 28 in-depth interviews (15 Australian, 13 New Zealand) across a wide range of retail categories. These exploratory data were combined with a review of the literature to explore retailer responses to the current economic downturn. Findings: This paper suggests that there are growth opportunities for retailers during times of economic downturn. Specifically, this paper suggests that large retailers see this as an opportunity to invest in green and sustainable business practices as a means to aid in the recovery of the recession in terms of reducing costs and beyond in terms of developing competitive advantage. Other strategies include: personalised offerings, differentiation via service, realignment of offer to changing consumer value(s), and reduced costs and investment. Research limitations/implications: The focus of this paper is medium to large sized organisations and, as such, its generalisability to small retailers may be somewhat limited. Originality/value: Past research reveals that not all the retailers are equally affected by recessionary periods. Given this, the value of this paper lies in providing insight into strategic response to an economic downturn, and providing a foundation for examining these strategies and their link to retail performance via quantitative research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; New Zealand; Recession; Retailing; Strategic planning",

That is, students must learn not only how to communicate technical concepts clearly and concisely and recognize cultural differences but also how to use language and choose media in ways that produce the social conditions necessary for effective collaboration in globally networked environments. The article analyzes two case studies-a workplace and a classroom-that illustrate how the mediating functions of language and the politics of technology intersect as mediating tools in globally networked activity systems.

Levels of coverage and contextual analysis of the content of the articles are used as surrogate measures of the penetration of business ethics concepts into society. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a text mining application based on two samples of data: analysis of 62 national newspapers in 21 countries from 1990 to 2008; analysis of the content of two samples of articles containing the term business ethics (comprised of 100 newspaper articles spread over an 18-year period from a sample of US and UK newspapers). Findings: The paper demonstrates increased coverage of sustainability topics within the media over the last 18 years associated with events such as the Rio Summit. Whilst some peaks are associated with business ethics scandals, the overall coverage remains steady. There is little apparent use in the media of concepts such as corporate citizenship. The academic community and company ethical codes appear to adopt a wider definition of business ethics more akin to that associated with sustainability, in comparison with the focus taken by the media, especially in the USA. Coverage demonstrates clear regional bias and contextual analysis of the articles in the UK and USA also shows interesting parallels and divergences in the media representation of business ethics.

The purpose of this paper is to undertake an in-depth examination of ethical relativity and ethical absolutism before concluding with a discussion of which research implications warrant further investigation. Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive, historical, anthological approach has been taken. Findings: Ethical relativism is regrettably subject to a proliferation of related terminology and, in many instances with different meanings ascribed to similar terms. In addition, ethical relativity appears to attract different research perspectives that are heavily dependent on their academic origins. A clear distinction needs to be made between ethical and situational relativity. It is suggested that relativism is present in the process of moral justification and that ethical relativism should be analyzed from three levels: the individual level, the role and group level, and the cultural levels. The over-riding objection to ethical relativism rests on the consequences of accepting relativism, which undermines the existence and strength of global moral standards and the inherent positioning of ethical absolutism. Absolutism does not deny the existence of multiple moral practices evident around the world, but proposes that variations in ethical actions could still be rooted in common universal moral standards based on our requirements as human beings and the necessities of long-term survival. Research limitations/implications: The ensuing discussions of relativism and absolutism open up a rich vein of research opportunities and suggest caution is required in regard to research methodologies. From a methodological perspective, care needs to be taken. For example, using hypothetical ethical dilemmas that are often unrelated to a specific industry or cultural setting has resulted in many researchers observing situational relativity rather than true ethical relativity. Originality/value: This paper specifically examines whether there are differences in underlying and basic moral standards even though similarities in ethical behaviour have been determined, or whether differing ethical actions could, as the absolutists believe, originate from common universal standards despite apparent differences in perceptions and actions across cultures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Ethics; Individual perception; National cultures",

It tracks the evolution of international conventions related to TNCs and human rights and assesses their effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes and analyzes efforts over the last four decades by the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Labour Organization and non-governmental groups to provide guidelines and encourage TNCs to aspire to international standards in human rights. Findings: The early attempts to regulate TNCs internationally lacked any form of the robust compulsion, systemic monitoring and effective enforcement mechanisms necessary to deal with the magnitude of the global investment arena. However, during the last decade, there has been explicit recognition on the part of the UN that action is necessary and the most recent convention emanating from the UN, the Norms, may evolve into a binding instrument on TNCs.

Assessing CSP has become in France an issue around which an organizational field has emerged in the mid 90s. The quest for legitimacy appears as a powerful driver for all the organizations in this field, but the strategies that social analysis and rating organizations deploy to achieve this aim differ significantly. Using a Weberian methodology, we have identified two ideal types of strategy: conservative (perpetuating the societal status quo) and activist (trying to impel change). We argue that these differences in strategies reflect ideological oppositions. Here also we have typified two opposite ideologies: utilitarian and non-utilitarian. Conservative strategies appear to be embedded in a utilitarian ideology; in the short term, they may seem more successful than activist strategies, but in the long term, their future appears more uncertain. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Activism; Conservatism; CSP; CSR; Ideal type; Ideology; Legitimacy; Organizational field; Social analysis; Social rating; SRI; Utilitarianism",

We expand on the idea that social involvement differs amongst sport organizations based on type, scope, direction, and target audiences. Therefore, in contrast to the majority of positivist models of social responsibility, we propose an integrated model of social involvement which notably includes the spatial (i.e., geographical) orientation of social involvement in sport. To begin distinguishing between the various forms of social involvement, we content analyzed the websites of nearly 100 sport entities to provide both typicality and a systematic variety of teams, leagues, and organizations to reveal general social involvement practices in the industry. We conclude that social involvement varies considerably in the sport industry and this variation can be partially explained by geographical reach, stakeholder influences, and business operations of the organizations. For example, multinational organizations are more likely to adopt CC activities than those operating in more localized context and the magnitude and scope of the social involvement tends to reflect the profile and size of the organization. © 2010 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.","Corporate citizenship; Corporate responsiveness; Corporate social responsibility; Social involvement; Social reporting; Sport industry",

Typically, business ethics cases are used to teach moral reasoning by exposing students to real-life situations which puts them in the position of a decision-maker faced with a moral dilemma. Drawing on a critical management studies' (CMS) critique of mainstream business ethics, this article argues that this 'ideal-type' decision-focused case underplays the social, political and economic factors which shape managerial decisions. An alternative 'dark side' case approach is presented, which highlights the structural features of capitalism and the role of government in regulating the market. The 'dark side' approach is illustrated with the case of a New Zealand woman, dependent on an oxygen machine, who died when her power was disconnected by her State-owned electricity supplier because of an unpaid bill. The case considers the actions of both the company and the industry regulator within the context of a 'light-handed' approach to government regulation. The article concludes with a discussion of how this approach to the case method, which moves beyond managers and their moral dilemmas, can provide students with a deeper understanding of the complexity of business ethics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; case teaching; critical management studies; management education; professionalisation",

This is unfortunate inasmuch as CMS potentially offers important analytical tools from which to address a range of germane issues pertaining to business ethics. As such, the aim of this article is to broadly introduce CMS to the business ethics scholarly community, underscoring particularly its central ontological and epistemological commitments.

This narrowness helped the field establish itself during the 1980s, when American management, under pressure from finance and heightened competition, was unreceptive to any limitations on its autonomy. Relying, however, on top-down approaches inspired by Aristotle, Locke, and Kant, while ignoring the consequentialism of Mill and Rawls, made the field totally reliant upon the good will of these same corporate executives for generating any impact. Trends in employee compensation, finance, regulation, government procurement, and taxpayer subsidies suggest that Business Ethics has failed to significantly influence corporate behavior, a result that would have not surprised the realists of the post-war generation of Business and Society scholars. If Business Ethics is to prove relevant in the contemporary world, the field needs to acknowledge past failures and develop new approaches.

However, in some cases, private companies have taken a leadership role in reuse planning for their moribund sites. This article explores these unique examples of corporate responsibility through surveys of federal and state brownfields officials in the United States and in-depth case studies of reuse projects in three U.S. cities. The findings suggest that firms appear to be motivated for promoting the reuse of their brownfields in order to maintain a reputation in their community, establish an economic precedent for successful reuse, maintain control over potential future environmental liabilities, and as a manifestation of corporate social responsibility. Implication for public works managers and planners include a need to leverage third party liability rules to encourage greater responsibility and leadership by firms in the reuse of their contaminated sites.","Brownfields; Contamination; Pollution; Property owners; Reuse planning",

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an empirical study to test a series of hypotheses concerning the impact of customers' commitment to a brand on their behaviors toward that brand. It then contrasts these behavioral changes with the assumptions of ethical frameworks. Findings: Customers' behaviors toward a brand change as they become committed to the brand. They shop less, consider fewer brands, and are willing to pay more. These changes violate assumptions of less stringent ethical frameworks. The result is that, as customer commitment increases, the ethical burden on the brand also increases. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited by the scope of the sample, automobile finance. Future research should explore customer commitment in other product and service categories to determine the extent to which commitment varies. Practical implications: The implications of these results are that, when a brand does a great job of satisfying customers and building trust, commitment develops, which increases the ethical burden on the brand. The very brand actions that develop commitment high quality, good service, caring about the customer, must actually increase in importance once strong customer relationships are built. Originality/value: The findings in the paper are unique, in that they evaluate a marketing model in terms of ethical impact, rather than simply in terms of increased sales or market share.

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a stakeholder management approach to focus on tasks related to multiple relationships. It employs an interview-based case method. Semi-structured qualitative interviews and documents were used to collect data. Interviews with external stakeholders provided additional information about management tasks and how they appear in the incubation context. The role of the incubator and the manager is described through the stories of three different technology ventures, which the incubator worked with at the time of the study. Findings: The tasks and challenges of the incubator manager concentrated around helping incubated companies gain access to much-needed knowledge. Different modes of knowledge were added to the start-up companies from the incubator's staff and manager and the owner companies. In order to manage knowledge flows effectively, organisational knowledge mode was highly valuable to the incubator manager. The hybrid corporate incubator's assignment is more diverse and less associated with the parent companies' core strategies than what is typical for a corporate incubator's assignment. Production of shareholder value did not have the highest priority. Other stakeholder groups than the shareholders reaped most of the benefit from the incubator's work. Practical implications: The paper discusses practical challenges tied to the work of incubator managers such as the need to be able to maintain relationships, align diverging interests and manage expectations from different stakeholders.

This article investigates the impact of political influences on destination branding by examining a sample of 94 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites (WHS) in 54 countries to determine whether democracy and political instability have a significant influence on the decisions of national tourism offices (NTOs) to promote their WHS as tourist destinations. It also examines the relative importance of political instability and democracy on the promotion of WHS by NTOs in comparison to other influences such as stewardship, economic development, and tourism. One of the key contributions of this article is that it applies a multivariate analysis to a field dominated by case study methodologies and suggests the potential complementarities between the two approaches. Democracy, it is hypothesized, facilitates the give and take inherent in reaching a common consensus among stakeholders on the nature and special meaning of a destination. It increases a society or country's civic capacity for collective action. Political instability, by contrast, is assumed to complicate the building of a consensus that enables nations to invest in and promote their heritage sites. The findings of this study suggest that the degree of democracy in a society has a significant role in encouraging the promotion of WHS as destinations. Political instability, by contrast, does not appear to have a significant impact in that regard. Democracy also appears to have a greater influence on the promotion of WHS by NTOs than influences such as economic development, quality of stewardship, and tourism. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Democracy; Destination branding; Political instability; Politics; World heritage",

Aristotle's thought is often seen as the basis of the virtue ethics tradition. For Aristotle, the idea of phronēsis, or 'practical wisdom', lies at the foundation of ethics. Confucian ethics has notable similarities to Aristotelian virtue ethics, and may embody some similar ideas of practical wisdom. This article considers how ideas of moral judgment in these traditions are consistent with modern ideas about intuition in management decision making. A hypothetical case is considered where the complexity of ethical decision making in a group context illustrates the importance of intuitive, phronēsis-like judgment.

Legal and extra-legal demands are dynamically changing; almost no organizational function is unaffected. Owing to the outsourcing wave of the last decade, in particular purchasing and supply management (PSM) plays an ever more important role in assuring sustainable production of the firm's products offered in the marketplace. The supply base of many Western firms has become increasingly global and spend volumes have shifted towards emerging countries. In order to avoid the risk of reputational damage to the buying company, the PSM department must ensure that their international suppliers comply with their corporate codes of conduct and that environmental and social misconduct at supplier premises does not occur. In this paper, ""sustainability"" refers to the pursuit of the tripartite of economic, environmental, and social performance. We contribute to prior research in the fields of sustainability and CR by extending insights of the dynamic capabilities view to analyze how the PSM function integrates sustainability aspects in its global supplier management processes. Based on four case studies in the chemical industry, we propose that profound sustainable global supplier management (SGSM) capabilities are a source of competitive advantage. These capabilities are path dependent and particularly valuable when organizations are receptive to external stakeholder pressure.

New types of ethical orientation have been developed, sometimes in strong opposition to contemporary ideological concepts such as socialism, materialism, or elitist capitalism. Even in the globalized environment of the twenty-first century these orientations are of continuing relevance, e.g. in organizational behavior, in business and society relations, and in basic concepts of corporate responsibility.

Its objective is to shed some light on the significance of Martin Luther's anthropology and theology of justification for a modern understanding of practical wisdom. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews some passages of source literature by Martin Luther and - with side glances to Georg Simmel - reflects on basic structures of personal failure, as implied by Luther's metaphor of the self-inclined man (homo incurvatus in se ipsum). By developing two theses, the paper proceeds to the question whether a protestant re-formulation of practical wisdom could be useful to overcome self-reference, not only on a personal, but also on an organisational level. Findings: Faith and love, reformulated as virtues of practical wisdom for modern management from a protestant perspective can be understood as a receptive attitude and the ability to establish non-instrumentalised and respectful relationships to humans. Lived by managers, they could help preventing companies and economy at large, to get caught in self-referential, and inherently instable feedback cycles.

It uses a cross section survey of 505 CEOs of Argentinean firms to gather information on environmental attitudes and a stakeholder theory framework to design and interpret the statistical analyses. It is underpinned by theoretical and empirical findings in the literature on stakeholder management, targeting in particular studies that deal with corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Latin America. Its general aim is to gain a deeper empirical understanding of the coherence between managers' perceptions of stakeholder pressures and the importance they are given in corporate CSR strategies through an empirical investigation of environmental management (EM) decisions. In doing so, it uncovers general differences in the way firms perceive and treat groups of stakeholders. It also detects variations across firms, observing that some are typically proactive in their response to stakeholder pressures whilst others are less responsive. Profiling the various stakeholder networks and the corporate response strategies in this way encourages the development of stakeholder-focussed policies and corporate strategies that emphasise communications, awareness and a clear sense of direction. It concludes that CSR appears to be more effective in the protection of the environment than previously reported.

As a case study it takes an interaction process between one NGO and one company with both collaborative and confrontational traits, spanning eight years and two issue fields, palm oil and soy, which are characterized by varying stakeholder contexts. The analysis demonstrates that the business-NGO interaction induced a change from a direct to an indirect corporate responsibility, and clarifies how interdependencies between the company and other stakeholders than the NGO influenced the interaction. The stakeholder interdependencies vary per issue field: In some issue fields, the stakeholder context allows for effective, collaborative interaction between business and NGO, while in another issue field, characterized by different stakeholder interdependencies, collaborative, constructive interactionbetween the same business and the same NGO is not feasible and, in addition, less effective in terms of CSR than confrontational interaction. © 2010 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

The argument is developed by means of a framework that integrates legal systems and financial structures. Hypotheses relating to environmental responsibility have been tested using Innovest data gathered between 2002 and 2007 from 645 companies in 16 countries; and hypotheses relating to social responsibility have been tested using Innovest data gathered between 2004 and 2007 from 600 companies. The findings demonstrate that legal systems influence corporate responsibility (CR) in both social and environmental spheres. They also support the claim that corporations are more likely to act in environmentally responsible ways when there are strong and well-enforced state regulations in place to ensure such behavior. Company size is shown to have a greater impact on CR than either excess cash or performance. Large companies tend to be more visible than small ones do, and society expects them to behave in a more socially and environmentally responsible manner regardless of their financial performance or available cash. Finally, these findings support the hypothesis that capital structure significantly influences CR: companies with a high number of publicly held shares and a low percentage of debt are more likely than others to commit themselves to social and environmental activities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate social responsibility; Europe; influence of financial structures; influence of legal systems",

However, firms do not compensate managers for having good relationships with its stakeholders. These results do not support stakeholder theory.

This is particularly true in the sport industry, where CSR is now an important area of focus for sport organisations, sport events and individual athletes. This article demonstrates how CSR can inform both theoretical debates and management practice within sport organisations. It does so by focusing on stakeholder theory, which overlaps considerably with CSR. In this article, stakeholder theory is used to examine three major CSR issues: stakeholder definition and salience, firm actions and responses, and stakeholder actions and responses. These three issues are considered in the context of the UK football industry. The article draws on 15 semi-structured qualitative interviews with senior representatives from a number of different organisations. These include the director of a large professional football club; a chief executive of a medium-sized professional football club in addition to the supporter-elected director; and the vice-chairman of a small professional football club. Additional interviews were undertaken with five representatives from national supporter organisations, two board members at two large supporter associations, two representatives from the Football League, one representative from the Independent Football Commission, and a prominent sports journalist. The analysis of the interview data illustrates ways in which CSR can be implemented by sport organisations through stakeholder management strategies. The article concludes that stakeholder theory has both conceptual and empirical value and can be used to illuminate key issues in sport management. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Football; Sport organisations; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder salience; Stakeholder theory",

Not all family firms, however, use their family name as part of their firm name. For example, while Dell Inc. and Gap Inc. are both family firms, Dell Inc.'s name includes the name of the founding Dell family, but Gap Inc.'s name does not include the name of the founding Fisher family. This research explores differences in strategic behavior between family firms that use their family name as part of their firm name (termed family-named firms, or FN firms) and those that do not (termed non-family-named firms, or NFN firms). The authors also investigate whether FN firms perform better than NFN firms, and whether or not their superior performance is mediated by differences in their strategic behavior. Findings based on a multi-industry sample of 130 publicly listed U.S. family firms over a five-year period (2002-2006) show that, compared to NFN firms, FN firms have significantly higher levels of corporate citizenship and representation of their customers' voice (i.e., presence of a chief marketing officer) in the top management team. FN firms also have a higher strategic emphasis (i.e., a greater emphasis on value appropriation relative to value creation) compared to NFN firms. Furthermore, FN firms perform better (i.e., have a higher ROA) than NFN firms, and their superior performance is partially mediated by their higher corporate citizenship levels and higher strategic emphasis.

The first part of the article determines that local officials in the Channel Islands disposed of operative margins, but that - in the interest of collaboration - these were not always used to the full. This article then details institutional factors that contributed to commonalities between the two bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey, as they faced up to occupation. The second part of this article follows up with the dissimilarities, one of which is that Guernsey travelled further down the road to collaboration than her sister island. Social capital depletion is credited as being responsible for this; and this situation was further compounded by lack of 'ethical leadership'. The final part explores the relationship between social capital and leadership ethics, suggesting that virtue serves as a catalyst for social capital stock in crisis situations. The core research outcome is that ethical leadership produces tangible efficiency and moral effects in situations of extreme duress (such as Nazi Occupation) where one could have expected very little or no scope for such a thing. This is an uplifting message that runs counter to scepticism as to the practical value of business ethics.

The crises of the recent past reveal huge, and in some cases criminal, failures of both ethics and leadership in finance, business and government. We posit that mainstream economic theory's construct of 'homo economicus' and its faith in the 'invisible hand' of the market constitute deeply flawed foundations upon which alone policy may be built and, farthermore, that these problematic foundations exert substantial shaping power over the institutional and discursive landscapes in which international business is transacted. Analogously, we argue that dominant approaches to business ethics and corporate social responsibility are, if not incorrect, at least in need of revisiting in terms of questioning their basic assumptions. Instead of the smugness of Western (especially Anglo-American) attitudes towards other ways of thinking, valuing and organising, it appears clear that openness, cooperation and co-creation between the developed and developing worlds is a basic prerequisite for dealing with the global challenges facing not just leaders, but humanity as a whole. This objective of stimulating discussion between dominant and marginal voices has guided our selection of papers for this Special Issue.

This paper proposes that social performance leads to enhanced brand equity and, conversely, brand equity positively influences social performance. Firm size is hypothesized to play a moderating role in the interrelationship. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses cross-sectional, secondary data of global brands. A system of equations is proposed and estimated using seemingly unrelated regression. Findings: Prior social performance has a positive effect on brand equity, but brand equity only impacts future social performance among very large firms. The positive effect of prior social performance on brand equity is amplified in smaller firms. Practical implications: Managers can increase brand equity by using corporate social responsibility as a strategic tool for positioning differentiation. To maintain competitive parity in social positioning and preserve brand equity, very large firms will likely need to ensure that they achieve comparable social performance as their global peer competitors.

Although companies and scholars alike have been searching for adequate performance measurement systems that allow them to evaluate their relations with society, practical approaches to measure the benefits of CSR are still missing. This paper aims at filling this research gap. It proposes a measurement and a governance model to evaluate and manage the business as well as the societal benefits of CSR. Design/methodology/approach: The research follows a two-step approach. First, a measurement model is developed based on a sound theoretical analysis. It is then applied in an in-depth case study to test its applicability to business practice. Findings: The research finds that current measurement approaches fail to provide a practicable measurement framework, especially relating to an evaluation of individual CSR activities. Thus, a framework is developed that applies methods of investment appraisal as well as qualitative evaluation approaches to individual CSR activities. The case study offers an easy-to-use evaluation tool that can be directly applied by business practice. Originality/value: Current research mostly focuses on quantitatively or qualitatively evaluating CSR. However, a comprehensive measurement of CSR needs to combine both. This is the focus of this paper. In addition, most measurement models focus on the business case for CSR. In this research, this perspective is complemented by proposing an evaluation from both perspectives - business and society. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business planning; Performance measures; Social responsibility; Social structure; Value added",

Findings: Stakeholder cohesion may have a ""dark side"" to the extent that it results in inertia and resistance to change, thus reducing propensity to innovation and change. The latter, in turn, are vital for both competitive advantage and stakeholder cohesion itself. Therefore, propensity to innovation and change is the pivotal variable that helps to explain the complex, non-linear, often inextricable relationships between CSP and CFP.

Design/methodology/approach: A two-part empirical investigation was conducted on a sample of GC participants (US signatories). The first method comprises a comprehensive survey completed mainly by company CEOs. The second approach involves content analysis of CEO statements (extracted from CSR reports - fiscal years 2007-2009), which describe new strategies for managing under challenging economic and financial times. Findings: It was found that the CSR efforts of participants of the GC that have integrated their CSR into their policies, programs, performance, and goals, and those with lesser conformity with the active principles of the GC will be affected more by the economic crisis.

Originality/value: The paper is the first to empirically analyse a broad range of companies regarding their voluntary stakeholder engagement mechanisms. This design allows the creation of a heuristic for stakeholder governance as well as for identifying clusters. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Social responsibility; Stakeholders; Structures",

The objective of this paper is twofold: primarily, to explore existing and potential linkages between multi-stakeholder standards; but, at the same time, to explore the potential for standard convergence. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows a conceptual approach that is supported by a variety of case examples. First, the nature and benefits as well as shortcomings of multi-stakeholder standards are explored. Second, a categorization scheme for the availability of such standards is developed. Third, linkages between the different standard categories are explored and discussed. Last but not least, the paper outlines practical implications. Findings: A variety of linkages between existing multi-stakeholder standards exist. These linkages need to be strengthened, as the market for corporate responsibility is unlikely to support a great variety of partly competing and overlapping initiatives. Originality/value: The paper offers a structured discussion of potential linkages between multi-stakeholder standards and thus complements the literature where such initiatives are discussed (usually without much mention of linkages). Practitioners will find the discussion useful to explore how their participation in a variety of initiatives can be better coordinated. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Governance; Regulation; Social responsibility; Stakeholders",

The paper aims to address the key steps in achieving such governance: chief ethics officer, tone-at-the-top, and whistle-blower hotlines. With that said, this paper will also address the value of unethical behavior, both from a macro and a micro perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an archival literature review to date on international corporate governance, and its challenges to achieve international corporate ethics compliance governance are analysed. Findings: One of the greatest challenges for international corporations is establishing a setup that involves more than the board of directors and senior management, but every employee within the corporation. A key compliance challenge is creating an international corporate culture that tolerates and encourages employees to come forward and report improper conduct. Originality/value: International corporate unethical behaviors are not myths, should not remain taboo, and should be addressed immediately, for it is not an incurable dilemma.

This work has transformed the field into a flourishing and increasingly influential discipline. No one has played a greater role in this development than Viviana Zelizer, one of the world's leading sociologists. Economic Lives synthesizes and extends her most important work to date, demonstrating the full breadth and range of her field-defining contributions in a single volume for the first time. Economic Lives shows how shared cultural understandings and interpersonal relations shape everyday economic activities. Far from being simple responses to narrow individual incentives and preferences, economic actions emerge, persist, and are transformed by our relations to others. Distilling three decades of research, the book offers a distinctive vision of economic activity that brings out the hidden meanings and social actions behind the supposedly impersonal worlds of production, consumption, and asset transfer. Economic Lives ranges broadly from life insurance marketing, corporate ethics, household budgets, and migrant remittances to caring labor, workplace romance, baby markets, and payments for sex. These examples demonstrate an alternative approach to explaining how we manage economic activity--as well as a different way of understanding why conventional economic theory has proved incapable of predicting or responding to recent economic crises. Providing an important perspective on the recent past and possible futures of a growing field, Economic Lives promises to be widely read and discussed. © 2011 by Princeton University Press.

This study directly addresses this issue by using upper echelon theory, and the KLD Research Analytics CSP ratings, to show that observable CEO characteristics predict differences in CSP between firms, even when firm and industry characteristics are controlled for. Using a sample of 650 public US firms I find that strong or exemplary CSP, as measured by the strengths categories of KLD's ratings, is positively related to the CEO having a bachelor's degree in humanities, having a breadth of career experience and being female. I find that KLD strength ratings are negatively related to the CEO having a bachelor's degree in economics and to their level of short-term compensation. Preliminary tests of causality support the assertion that these effects reflect CEO discretion rather than being an artifact of reverse causality. Significant relationships between the CEO characteristics and poor social performance as measured by the concerns categories of KLD's ratings are not found. This suggests that CEOs have more discretion in influencing strong and exemplary social performance than in impacting poor CSP. Implications, particularly for economics education, are discussed. While there are many fruitful directions for future research, the benefits and challenges to conducting similar studies in other countries is focused upon to correspond to the global nature of this special issue. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","CEO; corporate social performance; corporate social responsibility; KLD; leadership; upper echelon theory",

Design/methodology/approach: The paper explores the grounding of views of managerial capture in the Habermasian ideal of participative democracy. It then attempts to re-conceive the understanding of capture by drawing on Foucault's account of disciplinary power and its constitutive effects on subjectivity. Findings: Capture appears as a managerial mindset constituted by the pervasive demand for shareholder value. When stakeholder issues are considered within this frame they must be recast in ways that pose no moral or emotional challenge to the dominant logic of shareholder maximisation. This moral distancing or amoralisation can be traced to the accounting practices that make management visible to their superiors (board of directors or more senior levels of management) in terms of their utility. In seeking the recognition of their superiors, individual managers make themselves subjects of this deeper form of capture. Practical implications: A less restricted lens for conducting future research in managerial capture is offered. While in practice stakeholder engagement fails to live up to the Habermasian ideal, it still holds some promise for delivering management accountability. Originality/value: The paper shows that ideas of power and subjectivity are key to an understanding of environmental accountability and open the social and environmental accountability literature to a new set of interesting problematics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accounting procedures; Corporate social responsibility; Management accounting; Social accounting",

Design/methodology/approach: First, the different types of biometrics in the market with their advantages and disadvantages are reviewed, followed by a discussion of current applications within the hospitality and tourism sector. Findings: Potential business impacts of biometrics are identified such as increased consumer convenience, operational efficiency, and security. Meanwhile, despite its great benefits, consumers' privacy concerns that are raised during biometric data collection and management processes may keep the technology from realizing its full potential. Research limitations/implications: The paper only presents a glimpse of what may be done with the technology, as the potential extent of its usage is bound only by management's imagination while the possibilities that the technology brings to industry may be numerous. Practical implications: Hospitality and tourism companies must have clear goals and logical approaches for usage and implementation of biometric technologies. They also need to be acutely aware of any privacy, guest perceptions, attitude towards, and trust factors that may surround the usage of biometric technologies. Moreover, corporate responsibility and ethical usage of the information obtained from biometrics may influence guest willingness to use the technology.

Using three data points covering a period of nine years, five patterns are found: consistent reporters, late adopters, laggards, inconsistent reporters, and consistent non-reporters. Different dynamics can be seen in the various sectors, with some in which reporting has become established and others where it is more emerging.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a conceptual review of the business case for sustainable development that has been offered to the business world. The paper describes the unique features of SMEs that indicate the need to reframe the case for socially and environmentally sustainable business practices for SMEs, and, using arguments discussed in the literature, we summarize the business case for sustainable development that has been specified for SMEs. Findings: SMEs need particular attention when it comes to business strategies for sustainable development, since the business case is not the same as for large firms. Furthermore, tools that are developed to support sustainability in SMEs need to recognize that these companies have different resources and profiles than larger firms. Research limitations/implications: Sustainable development as a concept captures most issues facing our societies, which means there are endless possibilities for companies to find strategies that will impact - and hopefully improve - their social and environmental performance.

Design/methodology/approach: The incentives framework was designed as a practical tool for use during the development of a small business sustainability program. Although conceptual in nature, the framework is based on research conducted by the Washington State (USA) Department of Ecology that used, in part, a modified grounded theory approach. Findings: In addition to identifying and categorizing potential incentives, the paper presents an overview of mainstream thought on incentives and argues that incentives and disincentives are significantly different concepts. The paper identifies seven potential barriers to implementing incentives and summarizes potential solutions to those barriers. It also explains how incentives can be used to encourage sustainable behavior and corporate social responsibility reporting. Practical implications: The framework presented is intended to assist practitioners develop and structure incentive programs. It is also intended to provide guidance to practitioners regarding the current mainstream paradigm on incentives and recommends changes to that paradigm. Originality/value: The framework presented is entirely original. No similar framework appears to currently exist. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business planning; Incentive schemes; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Sustainable development",

For many professionals the concept of 'professional ethics' is one that implies that each individual has the moral reasoning capability to allow them to render business judgement without having self-interest to alter or impair their professional responsibility. Evidence in business ethics research suggests that the moral reasoning levels of some business students e.g. accounting students and accountants are in the lower range in comparison to other students and other professionals. The objective of this study is to investigate and report the moral reasoning levels of Cypriot business students and whether there are gender differences. This study uses Kohlberg's moral development theory as a framework and Rest's Defining Issues Test (DIT) as a measuring instrument to measure the moral reasoning of the students. This study found that Cypriot students' level of moral reasoning as measured by the DIT is at a very low level in comparison with other university students and there is no significant difference between the male and female students moral reasoning. © Common Ground, Maz Demosthenous, Maria Krambia-Kapardis.","Business Ethics; Business Students; Defining Issues Test; Ethical Decision Making; Gender; Kohlberg Moral Development Theory; Moral Reasoning",

Capital budgeting issues are appropriately discussed in accounting and/or finance disciplines, as well as healthcare management courses. The case and teaching note support the discussion and analysis of several secondary issues, in addition to the quantitative and qualitative factors incorporated in capital budgeting decisions. These issues include, but are not limited to, ethical issues, government policy practices, and sensitivity analysis. The quantitative analysis requires the student to demonstrate an understanding of the complexity that may be involved in determining relevant factors included in a capital budgeting decision, as contrasted with the simplicity of most textbook capital budgeting problems. The case is appropriate for use in junior level classes (level three) and above. There is a great deal of flexibility incorporated in the case, dependent on the instructor's desire to pursue, or not pursue, discussion of the secondary issues. This flexibility makes the case suitable for advanced analysis and discussions at higher course levels, up to and including first year graduate levels (level five).

However, class hours would be expected to range from one to two hours; preferably over two class meetings. Preparation hours required of the student are expected to average two to four hours. CASE SYNOPSIS This case considers the dilemma being confronted by an orthopedic physicians group. The practice is facing shrinking revenues driven by government plans to reduce Medicare reimbursements. In an effort to avoid salary cuts to physicians that appear imminent, members of the practice suggest raising rates to private payers. When this alternative is ruled out, it is decided that an expansion of ancillary services may provide a solution to the dilemma. The primary decision is whether to expand services by in-sourcing the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) diagnostic tool. Quantitative analysis of this decision requires the student to identify and determine the projected cash flows, associated with acquiring the MRI, over a twelve year period using net present value analysis. The realism of this decision problem is enhanced due to the fact that the physician's group serves several different classes of customers as well as using the MRI as a diagnostic tool for a variety of ailments/injuries. Each patient group and procedure results in a different reimbursement amount. This analysis is then expanded with two potential alternatives; a ten percent increase in prescribed MRIs or elimination of service to Medicare/Medicaid patients. Students should identify the quantitative impact of acquiring the MRI versus the status quo, as well as the ethical considerations associated with eliminating services to Medicare/Medicaid patients.

This neglect is puzzling given the skepticism of previous generations of CSR scholars and the importance these placed on labour-management cooperation. Arrighi's (1994) theory of the rise and fall of hegemonic societies can explain this shift in perspective. According to Arrighi, American global economic hegemony emerged a century ago powered by its multi-divisional corporations, but the extraordinary autonomy exercised by this organizational form stimulated demands for the responsible use of its economic power. When American hegemony was still new and based on industrial development, the discourse on CSR focused on 'the labour question' in order to insure productivity and social peace. As the nature of American hegemony expanded after World War II, academic views on appropriate corporate responsibilities broadened accordingly, and CSR embraced a pluralistic perspective capable of competing with other systems. Once American hegemony began its decline, and new competitive and financial pressures shook the stability of its institutions, the field of Business and Society adopted a managerialist version of CSR that relied on nonconsequentialist ethical abstractions. This contemporary perspective has had no measurable impact on corporate behaviour, and as American hegemony dissipates, any future version of CSR will necessarily be less ethnocentric, perhaps originating within other societies. © The Author(s) 2010.","American hegemony; business and society; business ethics; business schools; corporate social responsibility; labour-management cooperation; pluralism; stakeholder theory; world systems theory",

This paper aims to empirically explore the interrelationship between CG, CSR, financial performance (FP) and Corporate Social Performance (CSP) using a sample of 297 electronics companies operating in Taiwan, a newly industrialized Asian economy. The results show that a CG model which includes independent outside directors and which has specific ownership characteristics has a significantly positive impact on both FP and CSP, whereas FP itself does not influence CSP. The presence of independent outside directors in the firm has the greatest impact on the social performance of the firm's worker, customer, supplier, community and society dimensions. Government shareholders enhance a firm's social performance extraordinarily because government shareholders will be more likely to request that companies fulfill their social responsibilities. Only government shareholders positively and significantly relate to a firm's environmental performance. Furthermore, foreign institutional stockholders help to increase worker and supplier performance by paying more attention to employee policies and supply chain relationships. Finally, independent outside directors, foreign institutional stockholders and domestic financial institutional stockholders are shown to improve financial performance. © eContent Management.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance; Social performance; Stakeholder",

The novelty of the paper resides not in calculating ratios and interpreting them, but rather to looking more into some interesting strategic moves used to boost shareholders' value. We recommend shareholders to grasp opportunities for bargains from bailout banks, get more knowledge about the issue and still harvest their existing investments. Eventually, we advise the management of both government and financial institutions on the choice for reasoning bank bailouts, providing some critical thinking views and raise important research questions to both investors and academics.

Further, this research aims to develop a set of scales to measure multiple dimensions of supplier socially responsible practices. Finally, the paper examines the importance of three dimensions of supply chain structure, namely transparency, dependency and distance, for the adoption of these socially responsible practices. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on literature from several theoretical streams, current best-practice in leading firms and emerging international standards, four dimensions of supplier socially responsible practices were identified. Also, a multi-dimensional conceptualization of supply chain structure, including transparency, dependency and distance, was synthesized from earlier research. Using this conceptual development, a large-scale survey of plant managers in three industries in Canada provided an empirical basis for validating these constructs, and then assessing the relationships between structure and practices. Findings: Multi-item scales for each of the four dimensions of supplier socially responsible practices were validated empirically: supplier human rights; supplier labour practices; supplier codes of conduct; and supplier social audits. Increased transparency, as reflected in greater product visibility by the end-consumer was related to increased use of supplier human rights, which in turn can help to protect a firm's brands. Organizational distance, as measured by the total length of the supply chain (number of tiers in the supply chain), was related to increased use of multiple supplier socially responsible practices. Finally, as the plant was positioned further upstream in the supply chain, managers reported increased use of supplier codes of conduct. Practical implications: As senior managers extend, redesign or restructure their supply chains, the extent to which social issues must be monitored and managed changes. The four categories of supplier socially responsible practices identified help managers characterize their firm's approach to managing social issues. Furthermore, managers must more actively manage the development of supplier socially responsible practices in their firms when the supply chain has more firms; and when brands have stronger recognition in the marketplace. Originality/value: The paper makes three contributions to the extant literature. First, the construct of social issues is defined and framed within the broader debate on sustainable development and stakeholder management. Second, social practices are delineated for supply chain management, and a set of scales is empirically validated for assessing the degree of development of supplier socially responsible practices. Finally, the link between supply chain structure and the adoption of supplier socially responsible practices is examined. This last contribution provides a basis for understanding, so that managers can extend and reshape current views about how social issues must be managed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Canada; Corporate social responsibility; Fair trade; Operations management; Supply chain management",

Furthermore, a novel methodology in this area has been applied to test the code: ""The Experton Theory"". Findings: As a consequence, from the review of ethical and deontological codes from franchise associations of 46 countries, some associations' statutes and the laws about franchising in some countries, 29 topics were identified.

The global economy is currently in turmoil. In order for organisations to survive the global recession, now more than ever, relevant information is required to make decisions. Technology in the form of business intelligence and enterprise data warehousing can assist organisations in making the tough decisions they need to make. Data warehousing projects make up more than 10% of the information technology budgets of most corporate organisations and these projects have an estimated failure rate of 50%. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the current state of risk management in data warehouse projects and to determine where the main risk areas in these projects are. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, a Delphi process was used. The results show that risk management is practiced on data warehousing projects although the process is often not formal. Schedule overruns remain the main problem and on time delivery is the main criteria for success. In terms of risk management, the financial impact of risks is the most important to consider during risk analysis, lack of stakeholder management is the main cause for risk, scope creep has the biggest impact on risk and risk management is very important during the feasibility, design and implementation phases. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Business intelligence; Data warehousing; Development project; Enterprise data; Enterprise data warehouse; Failure rate; Financial impacts; Global economies; Global recession; Implementation phasis; On-time delivery; Risk areas; South Africa; Stakeholder management; Strategic advantages; Economic and social effects; Economics; Industrial management; Industry; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Technology; Data warehouses"

The relative power and size between stakeholders was instrumental in how insurers chose to develop relationships with individual physician practices.

Yet, the literature remains divided in its measurement approach ' either aggregated or disaggregated ' and therefore little is known specifically about how the overall nature (breadth and depth) of the corporate social strategies pursued by the firm might affect CFP. More importantly, little research has considered specifically that the absence of any social or environmental programs is also a strategic choice that is conceptually distinct from firms that choose to pursue even one CSP initiative. Herein I introduce the new construct of corporate social strategy (CSS) which reflects this strategic choice and defines the nature of stakeholder and social issues pursued by the firm by using an Entropy measure to assess the breadth of CSS and a specialization ratio to assess the depth of CSS. The resulting typology allows one to classify corporate social strategies as either disengaged, derivative, diffuse, dedicated or devoted. This new typology is tested using a sample of 147 manufacturing firms. Findings confirm that a disengaged CSS in particular is negatively related to CFP. This reframing of CSR as CSS thus has important implications for both research and practice.","Corporate social performance; CSR","CSR; Empirical research; Entropy measure; Environmental programs; Financial performance; Manufacturing firms; Reframing; Social issues; Social performance; Social strategy; Strategic choice; Industry; Research"

CEOs who have an incentive to take large risks and pursue the maximum level of profit may not divert organizational resource into corporate social responsibility-related issues, which do not contribute to profit immediately. In addition to establishing a conceptual link between stock-based CEO compensation and CSP, this paper clarifies their relationship by addressing three empirical issues overlooked in previous studies. First, I examine the possible difference between cumulative and annual stock option grants. Second, I examine the unique effect of in-the-money stock options. Third, I show that accounting for firm-level unobserved heterogeneities makes a substantial difference in estimation results. The results reveal that the relationships between stock-based compensation and CSP are substantially different when unobserved heterogeneities are accounted for, that a single year''s stock option grant does not have a significant impact on CSP while a cumulative grant does, and that in-the-money and at-the-money stock options have opposite effects on CSP.","Corporate social performance; Risk-taking; Stock-based CEO compensation","Estimation results; Risk taking; Significant impacts; Social performance; Social responsibilities; Stock options; Unobserved heterogeneity; Industry; Profitability"

People in general and people in business have their own sets of beliefs that may have been somewhat influenced by business ethicists and organizational scholars but not more than a bit. Those beliefs often have flaws, an obvious one being that especially in the business world these beliefs are (morally) unimaginative and too undemanding. Perhaps this is all we can reasonably hope for. But business ethicists should seriously consider what we can expect to contribute to these ethics and to the field. Two academic traditions are in the process of consolidation in our field, namely, normative and behavioral business ethics. The purpose of this paper is to explore the plausibility of the very distinction between a normative and a behavioral domain of research in business ethics and the examination of strategies for the collaboration of both traditions. In the course of this paper, I shall argue that the normative/descriptive divide in business ethics research is just a reflection of the is/ought distinction. And I shall conclude that the two strategies business ethicists have postulated to deal with the dichotomy, namely, separation and integration, are equally problematic because of the entanglement of facts and values and because of the need to preserve the logic and identity of the normative and the empirical inquiry. Rather than separation or integration, I shall propose a strategy of reconciliation, which does not entail synthesizing or dividing them but rather respecting the identity of both approaches while recognizing the limitations they place on each other.","Is-ought thesis; Normative ethics; Psychological realism","Business ethics; Is-ought thesis; Normative ethics; Psychological realism; Behavioral research; Research; Separation; Philosophical aspects"

In contrast to dominant explanations of stakeholder engagement focused on economic interest and social norms, I adopt a cognitive perspective to advance a theory of stakeholder orientation based on managers' understandings of the boundaries of the firm. In a mixed-methods study, drawing on extensive data collected across the subsidiaries of MNCs and involving a novel combination of cross-case comparison and fuzzy set analysis, I show that managers differ in their understandings of the firm and its purpose. Some conceptualize the firm as an entity defined by its legal perimeter, whereas others conceptualize it as an entity that extends beyond its legal boundaries to include a range of non-shareholder stakeholders. Consistent with theories of ideology formation, I show that these understandings are shaped by interests and by enactment. From the perspective of interests, business cases centered around innovation are linked to a broader scope of attention to non- shareholding stakeholders than efficiency-based rationales. From the perspective of enactment, ongoing interaction supports attention to value creation for stakeholders irrespective of economic rationale.","Corporate social responsibility; Multinational corporation; Stakeholder orientation","Business case; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Economic interests; Multi-national corporations; Shareholdings; Social norm; Stakeholder engagement; Value creation; Competition; Fuzzy sets; Industry; Managers; Shareholders; Economic and social effects"

Results of both partial least squares and mixed-model procedures showed that employees' climate perceptions mediate the relationship of supervisors' climate perceptions with employees' safety behavior.

While it is assumed that not-for-profit organizations, given the very nature of their existence, are likely to meet the same social standards as the corporate sector, very little research has been done as to whether such organizations are practicing what they preach. Despite the fact that most of the well-known international NGOs have the organizational layout, funding, branding, and public relations of a large MNC, the expectations of these entities are less clearly defined. Are their resources better spent on the mission of their organization, or are they to be held to the highest standards of social conduct given their position as role models? Or is the most beneficial role of the NGO that of consultant to the corporate sector, regardless of whether they conduct such practices themselves? If not, how can CSR be incorporated into the business plan of a not-for-profit organization? The attempt to initiate these relatively new expectations of socially conscious behavior into the standard daily operations of a not-for-profit organization is viewed in the context of the similarity of NGOs to the MNCs which they position themselves to lead in the dawn of the CSR revolution. Looking specifically at the World Resources Institute, the International Labor Rights Forum, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the study then goes on to examine the incentives behind CSR, and whether those goals are best met by current practices. Ultimately, the study revealed that the integration of socially responsible business practices into everyday operations is best met when the endeavor is in line with the central goal of the organization, and socially conscious practices which fall outside of this scope are of a lesser concern. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,

This is because my thoughts on this subject are necessarily based on personal experience, and because my work on corporate responsibility is premised on two disconcertingly questionable assumptions: first, that business can make a positive contribution to sustainable development, even in southern Africa (where I live and work), and second, that the academic practice of research and teaching assists to this end. This is in the context of opposing perspectives, also among academics, on whether business can, indeed, make a decisive difference. To some extent the tensions between these perspectives have led to important research and debates, but the chapter argues that there are significant constraints to the realisation of the academic ideal of open and informed debate. These constraints relate to the social and cultural context in which academics work and they pertain to the resource base of academic work, including access to finances and information, as well as the socialisation of researchers in peer groups and wider social networks. At the root of these challenges, are increasing cultural and economic pressures to perform according to particular standards, coupled to personal ambition driven by broader social trends. Hence, just as we academics are emphasising the development of business decision-makers as 'whole persons' - capable of transcending self-interest and instrumental rationality - it is questionable whether we are able to teach by example. The implication is that we, as academics, ought to revisit what whole personhood means and how we can foster it within ourselves, as we seek to foster it within the business community. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,

Since stakeholders are source of uncertainty and their actions or behaviours can be modelled as risks/opportunities for the project, a quantitative estimate of their salience using the concept of risk can drive to improve project value. The impact of the risks deriving from each stakeholder on project performance represents the risk load brought into the project by the source and it can be assumed as an indicator of the stakeholder salience. The project team shall allocate more resources to the stakeholders having major influence in order to avoid/run their risks/opportunities. The analysis of the trigging dynamics, from stakeholder general interest to specific influence on project performance through a systematic approach, allows the project team to identify appropriate measures to break the chain by which the risks are triggered and satisfy stakeholders needs through appropriate actions. Thus, a holistic approach integrating stakeholders and risk management consequently leads to an efficient allocation of resources and an effective satisfaction of stakeholder requirements. The results on a major project case study proof that the proposed approach is justified balancing potential savings on capex contingency deriving from risks avoided and costs of implementing mitigation actions.",,"Development project; Holistic approach; Major project; Project performance; Project team; Quantitative estimates; Risk based approaches; Stakeholder management; Risk management; Uncertainty analysis; Risk perception"

In this framework, firms can influence their probability of liquidation by choosing an appropriate capital structure. Also, the literature suggests NFS bargaining power may affect firm financing decisions. In the current article we investigate these ideas for initial financing decisions by business start-ups, where ex ante failure risk is high and NFS must decide whether to make relationship-specific investments. We find that start-ups imposing larger costs on their NFS following liquidation significantly reduce leverage. This effect is strengthened when suppliers have greater bargaining power. We also document a marginally negative effect of NFS liquidation costs on the proportion of bank loans. Finally, business start-ups rely less on bank loans when customers and suppliers are in a powerful bargaining position. © 2010 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association.",,

The principles articulate (at an abstract level) citizens' rights; these rights create interests across all aspects of society, including in the space of economic activity; and therefore, stakeholders - as citizens - have legitimate interests in the space of economic activity. This approach to stakeholder theory suggests a political interpretation of Boatright's Moral Market approach, one that emphasizes the rights/place of citizens. And this approach to stakeholder theory - in terms of citizens - raises a further question, what rights and obligations do economic agents have, beyond those attached to their roles as citizens? Rawls would reject additional rights and obligations of this sort for two reasons, one tied to freedom and one tied to pluralism. Rawls' work therefore presses us to re-conceptualize the place of ethical claims in the economic context. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Moral Markets approach; organizational ethics; Rawls; social contract theory; stakeholder theory (normative foundations)",

Everyone appears to interpret globalization differently. This uncertainty of definition is one of the reasons why innumerable fears are associated with the concept. People talk of the end of the nation state, of the ever-widening gulf between rich and poor, of an economy that ignores state boundaries, of the impotence of politics, of a loss of order. The negative picture of globalization is being stubbornly retained in many minds. International corporations were already operating on a global scale long before anyone coined the term globalization. They traded and otherwise pursued their business interests, although admittedly not with the same intensity or to the same extent as companies do today. Globalization in its most immediate and neutral form represents the rapid increase in economic interrelationships worldwide - and how these are affecting movements of capital, investment strategies, and migration (Di Fabio 2008). Of course, no one in their right mind would deny that globalization also brings with it numerous risks: As we are currently experiencing, due to the international interdependence of the financial markets, the danger of a world economic crisis can essentially never be eradicated. However, while the risks of globalization are undeniable, so are the opportunities that it brings. And these opportunities are also open to us, although, unfortunately, they are all too frequently overlooked. International corporations have to accept their role as scapegoats for an apparently unjustified loss of jobs, coupled with people's greedy desire for ever higher returns - but they are also in a position to make globalization a success for everyone associated with them, their suppliers, and their people. My own attitude is to regard globalization as a unique and highly promising opportunity to improve the lives and circumstances of everyone involved in the process. In the following study, I will endeavor to outline the challenges of globalization and changing market conditions with which international corporations such as Henkel are confronted. Important issues in this regard are corporate responsibility, sustainability, diversity and training, and education. Those companies tackling these issues with enthusiasm, conviction, and social awareness will be able to successfully participate in the globalization project, a process that is as inexorable as it is necessary. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",,

The paper presents and analyzes a case study of Nippon Steel Sustainability Report 2008, which is a CSR report published by Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC). The key elements revealed in the report were (1) financial performance; (2) quality of management; (3) social and environmental responsibility performance; (4) employee quality and (5) the quality of the goods/services provided. These five elements played a crucial role in ranking companies according to their reputation scores. The paper analyzes the report with content analysis. In addition, an image restoration framework is employed in the paper. The analysis leads to two conclusions about the CSR reporting which companies can use to manage reputation risk. First, CSR reporting as a communication tool can deliver information on five elements of reputation which would enhance reputation capital. Second, some image restoration strategies are employed in CSR reporting, which implies that CSR reporting could work as part of RRM process. © 2010 IEEE.","Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Reputation risk management","Communication tools; Content analysis; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental responsibility; Financial performance; Image restoration; Key elements; Nippon steel corporations; Nippon steels; Reputation risk management; Sustainability report; Image reconstruction; Industry; Management science; Restoration; Risk management; Risk analysis"

Through a discourse analysis of more than 750 projects presented to the Asian CSR Awards we firstly acknowledge the homogeneity of the discourse used by companies of all sorts to legitimize their actions. We distinguish two main argumentation repertoires, one based on a symbolic logic and a second based on a managerial logic. We argue that the two argumentation repertoires are used in confrontation that mirrors the paradoxes of managing sustainability projects. The firm rhetoric reproduces the distance between the output oriented legitimacy (through the managerial rhetoric) and the input oriented (through the symbolic rhetoric). We also observe that each type of rhetoric has evolved over the past 6 years in a way that we can trace the trends in the management of sustainability projects. Finally, we acknowledge differences in the argumentation repertoires depending on the organization characteristics. Each type of company manages its rhetoric to serve their legitimacy needs. On the one hand, local and small organizations tend to use a more managerial discourse as their legitimacy need is centered in the maintaining of the license to operate. On the other hand, global and large corporations legitimize themselves through a more symbolic discourse appealing at the importance of stakeholder engagement, partnerships and sustainability. This might be a sign of their need to still gain their license to operate.","Corporate social responsibility; Legitimacy; Rhetoric","Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Discourse analysis; Legitimacy; License to operate; Rhetoric; Small organizations; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability project; Symbolic logic; Economic and social effects; Managers; Sustainable development; Industry"

They act as a servant or full member of the board of directors, the body that formulates corporate strategies; which are subsequently executed by executive directors. When corporate secretaries become full members of the board, they pass on their duties as the secretary to someone else and take on the role of governance in directorship capacity. The field of CSR has impacted on all professions that aspire to make a positive contribution to societies. For this reason, members of the chartered secretaries' professional body and those other chartered bodies in the UK who statutorily can become corporate secretaries have had to absorb all the challenges and opportunities that the field of CSR has thrown at them, albeit in collaboration with their other senior executive colleagues in organisations. This chapter seeks to analyse how corporate secretaries have contributed and continue to contribute to recent developments in the field of CSR. The chapter argues that modern stakeholders look on corporate entities to meet all their economic, social, ethical, legal and philanthropic responsibilities whilst remaining virtuous, Friedman (1962, 1970), Elkington (1997) and Carroll and Buchholtz (2003) even though meeting these responsibilities may at first sight appear contradictory and impossible, de Wit and Meyer (2004). Wood (1991) argues that business and society are interwoven rather than distinct entities. If this is so, then it is relevant to ask how today's professionals including corporate secretaries are coping with the task of meeting their CSR requirements to society. There are numerous benefits that can emanate from following a good corporate citizenship strategy or being involved in several pro bono publico activities by an entity according to Jones et al. (2006), as this action is one of the variables that determine whether an entity survives and prospers or declines and fails in modern markets. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,

This case study will examine the practical and ethical issues involved in the case: Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee v. American Home Assur. Co., Inc., 261 S.W.3d 24 Tex.Sup. Ct. J. 590 (Tex. Mar 28, 2008) (American Home). The primary area of concern for this case is whether or not the interest of the insurance company and their insured are ever truly the same. Secondary issues in this case study will include an examination of whether or not the acts of a staff attorney constitute the acts of a corporation itself, and if they do - is this an unauthorized practice of law. An additional secondary issue is the idea that by the nature of his employment, a staff attorney's legal judgment may be influenced in that his employer controls the scope and depth of investigations, fees made available for discovery, expert testimony, and general guidelines the attorney must follow in pursuing the defense in trial. This case is designed for use in an undergraduate business law/business ethics course, or graduate level course in management law. The various legal aspects emphasized in this case could be taught in one fifty-minute class. The assignment is expected to require approximately 1 to 2 hours of outside preparation time by the student. Case Synopsis: Like many states, Texas has long struggled with the question of how many clients does an attorney, who has been hired by an insurer to defend an insured, have. Courts have tended to rule that these attorneys have two clients in the insurer and the insured, yet they owe an unqualified loyalty to the insured who has been sued. The Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee has sought to end or limit this practice based on concerns that a staff attorney, whose actions can be strictly controlled by his employer, will have an irreconcilable conflict of interest and be unable to give full allegiance to the insured. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Texas reviewed a prior decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh District of Texas. In American Home, the court was asked to determine if an insurance company's use of staff attorneys to defend cases filed against their insured resulted in the insurance company practicing law. If this did constitute the practice of law it would be a violation of Texas law. The Court ruled in part that the use of staff attorneys did not constitute unauthorized practice of law on the part of the insurance corporations. This case study will discuss that decision and attempt to determine if a staff attorney can avoid being improperly influenced by their nonattorney supervisors and those supervisors' duties of maximizing profit.",,

In this paper, we introduce a new recommendation service, called link revival, that suggests users to re-connect with their old friends, such that the resulted connection will improve the social network connectivity. To achieve high connectivity improvement under the dynamic social network evolvement, we propose a graph prediction-based recommendation strategy, which selects proper candidates based on the prediction of their future behaviors. We then develop an effective model that exploits non-homogeneous Poisson process and second-order self-similarity in prediction. Through comprehensive experimental studies on two real datasets (Phone Call Network and Facebook Wall-posts), we demonstrate that our proposed approach can significantly increase the social network connectivity, and that the approach outperforms other baseline solutions. The results also show that our solution is more suitable for online social networks like Facebook, partially due to the stronger long range dependency and lower communication costs in the interactions. © 2010 ACM.","Connectivity; Hurst; Link revival; Prediction; Social network","Connectivity; Hurst; Link revival; Prediction; Social Networks; Forecasting; Knowledge management; Poisson distribution; Social networking (online); Walls (structural partitions); Telephone circuits"

We review this body of work and present the dual pathway model of respect, developed to integrate the different lines of research into a single testable framework. Research testing the model's predictions is presented. Findings - The dual pathway model posits that concerns about respect follow from the need for social inclusion and for status attainment. Fair treatment from group peers and authorities communicates the extent to which these needs are satisfied, and as such, perceptions of being liked (indicative of inclusion) and of being judged worthy (indicative of status attainment) independently and differentially predict social engagement and psychological well-being. Originality/value - The dual pathway model provides a framework for integrating and extending existing research on the experience of respect in groups. The model highlights how the inclusion and status dimensions of respect differentially shape outcomes relevant to group functioning: social engagement and psychological well-being.

He also threatened to place a lien on the Stewart's home until the additional money requirement was met. At this point, the Stewarts feel compelled to document their refusal to pay additional money to Nye and to hold Nye to the terms of their initial agreement, to clarify their position to his demands, to document the extent (percentage) of the work accomplished to date in order to calculate what percentage of the agreed-upon wages should be paid to date, to specify what jobs still need to be done, and to document the deterioration of their business relationship with Nye for possible legal action.

Results demonstrate that both IE and OE influence EI. Ethical congruence is also discussed as a positive influence. Younger managers are more influenced by OE than older managers. The findings call for creating governance mechanisms to enhance ethical congruence, thereby increasing the likelihood of managers making ethical choices in organizational decision-making. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; corporate governance; ethical congruence; ethical intentions; individual ethics; international decision-making; organizational ethics",

In this chapter, the correlation between business ethics and corporate governance is reviewed and organized in order to demonstrate how this topic was viewed by previous scholars along with a proposal of how these two topics can be joined together. The question of how the agency problem in corporate governance emerges is then examined, followed by a literature review of past studies on the influences of introducing business ethics on the agency problem as well as their relationship.

There was an average increase of 10% in the number of companies adopting environmental practices from 2003 to 2006. There was less of an increase for social practices, although still more commonly adopted by companies than environmental practices. Values and beliefs of management were the overwhelming driver for the adoption of sustainability practices with reputation and brand also significant drivers. Costs, management time, and knowledge/skills were the three most commonly reported barriers to adoption of sustainability initiatives. The implications of the study are that for New Zealand business, there is a strong link with the business case for sustainability.

User value and environmental harm are created in supply chains and it could therefore be argued that company business ethics should be extended from the company to the entire value chain from the first supplier to the last customer. Starting with a delineation of the linkages between business ethics, corporate sustainability, and the stakeholder concept, this article argues that supply chains generally have a great innovation potential for sustainable development. This potential could be highlighted with system thinking and the use of change management knowledge, promoting not only innovations within technology but also within organizational improvement. We propose process models and performance indicators as means of highlighting improvement potential and thus breaking down normative business ethics' requirements to an opertionalizable corporate level: Good business ethics should focus on maximizing stakeholder value in relation to harm done. Our results indicate that focusing on supply chains reveals previously unknown innovation potential that seems to be related to limited system understanding. The assumption is that increased visibility of opportunities will act as a driver for change. Results also highlight the importance of focusing on sustainability effects of the core business and clearly relating value created to harm done. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","measurement system; supply chain; sustainability indicators",

The paper will draw indirectly on lessons derived from research, funded by a multi-national mining company in regional Western Australia, to address conflict between the company and an impacted neighbouring community. Social work knowledge directed the research towards enabling dialogue and mutual respect, with due attention to power issues and the need for social justice for people and sustainability for the local environment. Profit unhinged from these parallel considerations of people and place threatens sustainability as well as social justice. A key insight is the creative potential of stakeholder relationships in collaboratively dialoguing about the conflict to find common ground and ways forward. Legalistic strategies, media coverage and government policies and inquiries were inadequate to address the conflict. Local supported dialogues with company managers and impacted people can make a difference for the better. This difference for the better has important implications for CSR being a public responsibility, not solely owned and driven by corporations or government. Additionally, the social dimension of sustainability concerns contains the creative potential when competing agendas, conflict and power issues are embraced. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,

Balancing economic and environmental performance to be green and competitive is therefore a key strategic issue. The information technology (IT) sector is one of the pioneer sectors which started working on the sustainable development model. However, it is only lately that researchers and organisations have begun to consider the role of IT, not only in contributing to a businesses environmental footprint but also in tackling climate change problems. Usually coined as, ""Green Information Technology"", the role of IT in causing and resolving ecological sustainability, in maintaining low cost IT shops, in building green reputation capital and in supporting corporate green strategies has hardly been researched. This paper identifies five main areas of Green IT capability and describes the main pillars of a G-readiness framework to help organisations evaluate their maturity for Green IT. The utility of the framework is demonstrated through a desk-based research case study of four organisations. The paper argues that just as e-readiness has been, and continues to be, a critical capability in the digital economy, G-readiness is an equally critical capability in the low carbon digital economy. Without a clear understanding of G-readiness, organisations would approach Green IT initiatives on an ad hoc and somewhat reactive basis, which is undesirable.","Digital business; G-readiness index; Green IT; IT strategy; Sustainable business",

The point of view put forward here attribute paternity of the stakeholder theory essentially to Freeman as a strategic framework for business studies and practices (1981, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 2001, 2004), as a strong framework for political and moral philosophy (1988, 1994, 1998), as an inescapable framework for business ethics (2000). In order to take into account the advancement bringing by Freeman, the intention of this article is to demonstrate the degree to which stakeholder theory can be considered as a theory of civil society, which in turn is a theory of business. The argument will be based on the following points:Stakeholder theory occupies an intermediate position between strategic management and political philosophy in that it presents a new form of sovereignty, the sovereignty of big business;Stakeholder theory is a strategic theory; whether it legitimises, relativises or neutralises the sovereignty of the firm, it conceptualises and situates it in relation to other models;Stakeholder theory can be understood as a theory of civil society for the 21st century but it cannot be a substitute for a civil society theory devised in the 19th century;Stakeholder theory can thus be considered as affording a strategic perspective that, although somewhat unfamiliar, serves as the foundation of business ethics. © 2010 EURAM Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

We use the U.S. post-World War 2 policy decisions with respect to Japan and Europe (the Marshall Plan) to show how this problem can be addressed. To help Japan become a western style democracy and stem the tide of communism, the U.S. transferred much of its extant intellectual property to Japan with a promise to open US markets to Japanese goods. The United States did not require Japan to open its markets to U.S. goods. As a result, Japan became a staunch U.S. political ally in Asia, but also a serious economic competitor to the United States. While the Marshall Plan deployed different resources, the political outcomes were similar to Japan: Western Europe was a bulwark against communism. As global warming has become a major strategic issue, we argue that a comparable IPR initiative is required for China. This is not just a matter of doing the right thing as members of global commons, but is also matter of national security. We propose that by facilitating and managing the flow and sharing of U.S., EU, and Japanese Cleantech intellectual property with China-through a Cleantech Marshall Plan-a positive strategic relationship may be built while helping to bring global warming under control. © 2010 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

It explores the role of spatial distribution of principals (firms) and mediating agents (intellectual property litigation firms) in facilitating and sustaining the conflictual relationships. Spatial propinquity is hypothesized to determine the nature of social relationships between the principal's and the mediating agent's employees, subsequently affecting the mediating agent's involvement in identification of opportunities for conflictual interactions by the principal. Propinquity is also predicted to decrease principal's communication and transportation costs while maintaining a professional relationship with the mediating agent, hence proving a more positive economic outlook of entering into and sustaining conflictual ties. The context of this study is the patterns of spatial distribution of 405 U.S. firms in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals (the principals) and 57 leading intellectual property litigation firms (the mediating agents). It relates these patterns to the involvement in patent infringement disputes by the biopharmaceutical firms in 1998-2006.

As part of what has been termed the new economic geography, this area of research is less than 20 years old, and is now developed sufficiently so that the discussion can be organized around certain stylized and commonly accepted facts: • Innovation is spatially concentrated. • Geography provides a platform to organize economic activity. • All places are not equal: urbanization, localization, and diversity. • Knowledge spillovers are geographically localized. • Knowledge spillovers are nuanced, subtle, pervasive, and not easily amenable to measurement. • Local universities are necessary but not sufficient for innovation. • Innovation benefits from local buzz and global pipelines. • Places are defined over time by an evolutionary process. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize recent work on innovation and location in light of these themes, and to consider how these stylized facts shed light on the broader process of technological change and economic growth. While firms are one venue to organize economic activity, the resources required to generate innovation are typically not confined to a single firm, and geography provides another means to organize the factors of production. Geography is additionally a venue for complex multifaceted social relationships, and human community and creativity that are beyond the economic sphere. Economies are complex: highly integrated, globally interconnected, and highly agglomerated on centers of activity. There is always the temptation to analyze economic institutions and actors individually; however, the new economic geography literature considers the large context. Of course, once the analysis is open to consider geography there is a need to understand history, building a deep contextualized understanding of a place and the relationships that define it. The present review of the literature summarizes the advancements made in this stream of inquiry, but also indicates that many open avenues for research remain, thus encouraging others to contribute to the emerging field of economic geography. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Agglomeration economies; Geography of innovation; Knowledge spillovers; Localization; New economic geography; Urbanization",

It could be taught in a 1 1/2-hour session and is expected to require 2 hours of outside preparation by students. Case Synopsis: Alex and Lauren Stewart, new to the Houston area, retained the services of a general contractor to make repairs to the home that they had just bought. Although they took great care in researching, specifying the work, and hiring Nye Contracting, they encountered problems from the start with the contractor, his various crews, interruptions and delays in the work schedule, and poor quality work. The last straw for the Stewarts was Nye's demand for additional money for materials to complete the job. He also threatened to place a lien on the Stewart's home until the additional money requirement was met. At this point, the Stewarts feel compelled to document their refusal to pay additional money to Nye and to hold Nye to the terms of their initial agreement, to clarify their position to his demands, to document the extent (percentage) of the work accomplished to date in order to calculate what percentage of the agreed-upon wages should be paid to date, to specify what jobs still need to be done, and to document the deterioration of their business relationship with Nye for possible legal action. Alternatively, however, the Stewarts are considering more positive communication in the hopes of convincing Nye to complete the job he agreed to perform initially and to maintain goodwill.",,
"Robertson J., Sullivan L.","Use of staff attorneys in defending insurance cases: Can an attorney serve two masters?",2010,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78649962495&partnerID=40&md5=4f2e3bfce715a1c7d93df7325132b897","Case Description: This case deals with the issue of whether or not staff attorneys, employed by an insurance corporation, can legally or effectively represent an insured client in an insurance defense case. This case study will examine the practical and ethical issues involved in the case: Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee v. American Home Assur. Co., Inc., 261 S.W.3d 24 Tex.Sup. Ct. J. 590 (Tex. Mar 28, 2008)(American Home). The primary area of concern for this case is whether or not the interest of the insurance company and their insured are ever truly the same. Secondary issues in this case study will include an examination of whether or not the acts of a staff attorney constitute the acts of a corporation itself, and if they do - is this an unauthorized practice of law. An additional secondary issue is the idea that by the nature of his employment, a staff attorney's legal judgment may be influenced in that his employer controls the scope and depth of investigations, fees made available for discovery, expert testimony, and general guidelines the attorney must follow in pursuing the defense in trial. This case is designed for use in an undergraduate business law/business ethics course, or graduate level course in management law. The various legal aspects emphasized in this case could be taught in one fifty-minute class. The assignment is expected to require approximately 1 to 2 hours of outside preparation time by the student. Case Synopsis: Like many states, Texas has long struggled with the question of how many clients does an attorney, who has been hired by an insurer to defend an insured, have. Courts have tended to rule that these attorneys have two clients in the insurer and the insured, yet they owe an unqualified loyalty to the insured who has been sued. The Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee has sought to end or limit this practice based on concerns that a staff attorney, whose actions can be strictly controlled by his employer, will have an irreconcilable conflict of interest and be unable to give full allegiance to the insured. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Texas reviewed a prior decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh District of Texas. In American Home, the court was asked to determine if an insurance company's use of staff attorneys to defend cases filed against their insured resulted in the insurance company practicing law. If this did constitute the practice of law it would be a violation of Texas law. The Court ruled in part that the use of staff attorneys did not constitute unauthorized practice of law on the part of the insurance corporations. This case study will discuss that decision and attempt to determine if a staff attorney can avoid being improperly influenced by their nonattorney supervisors and those supervisors' duties of maximizing profit.",,
"Ghazzawi I.","The next generation of entrepreneurs: A reflection of a college outreach business program for high school students",2010,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78650325818&partnerID=40&md5=65aa63c13edd5c869782a1a409490622","To address the persistent problems of poverty and underrepresentation of minority and first generation college-bound students, governments, educational institutions and foundations, philanthropies, service organizations, and others are creating initiatives for these students. Over the past three years the University of La Verne's College of Business and Public Management has been conducting a community outreach program for high school students. This paper represents a two year outcome assessment of a community outreach program that targeted first-generation, lowincome, and minority students from various Southern California School Districts intended to motivate students to seek college education in general and business education and entrepreneurship in particular. The outreach program was developed with a mission to overcome issues that usually restrict the college ambitions of the targeted population. Over the past two years (2007 and 2008), one hundred and eighteen high school juniors participated in a three-week business camp that introduced them to topics such as market and economics, success skills (including management, organization, creating an organization website, and presentations and job interviewing techniques), entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and business ethics. All classes were delivered by college professors and volunteer business and community leaders. Before the program, a combined 78% of participants indicated their willingness to go to college, while in the post assessment survey 96% indicated their desire to attend college. Only 2% indicated as ""not sure"" and 2% abstained due to illness. Additionally, on the post test, 50% indicated their desire to own a business in the future compared to 20% on the pre-test. Knowledge gained as measured in pre and post tests were positive on all five variables (i.e. market/economics, success skills, financial literacy, business ethics, and entrepreneurship).",,
