However, little is known about how they affect the social performance of their members. We utilize institutional theory to develop the position that business social performance has collectivist roots that deserve at least as much scholarly attention as owner/manager characteristics and business attributes. Hypotheses are tested using multilevel analysis on data gathered from 898 members of twenty-nine business associations. Support is provided for institutional theorys explanation for business social performance. Members of business associations are likely to conform to the pattern of social performance prevailing in their association, but not necessarily to the articulated values of the association. The potential of business associations to influence members' social performance should be considered by agencies that start and support them as mechanisms for regional and local economic development.",,

To address this issue, we focus on marketing-related journals and assess the intellectual structure of sustainability research in detail. Drawing on social network theory, we perform an extensive co-citation analysis using multidimensional scaling to examine 76,342 citations made in 1,320 sustainability-focused articles from 36 journals over 51 years (1958-2008). This study specifies that the topics of citizenship behavior, stakeholder theory, corporate performance, and the triple bottom line are integral sustainability research areas. In addition, the results indicate five required topics for examining sustainability in the marketing context: external-internal focus, social-environmental emphasis, legal-ethical-discretionary intent, marketing assets, and financial performance. Supported by the capabilities-based resource perspective, the sustainability-focused typology and framework advanced provide directed structure for future research. © 2010 Academy of Marketing Science.","Bibliometric analysis; Corporate environmental performance; Corporate environmental responsibility; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Intellectual structure; Longitudinal analysis; Marketing-finance interface; Multidimensional scaling; Social network theory; Sustainability; Triple bottom line",

In economics, finance, and accounting journals, the average correlations were only about half the magnitude of the findings published in Social Issues in Management, Business Ethics, or Business and Society journals (mean corrected correlation coefficient p of .22 vs. .49, respectively).

This study first explores the relationship of ethical corporate citizenship to financial performance (i.e., greater profitability and efficiency, and lower cost of capital). Second, the study examines whether ethical corporate behavior is associated with a marketvalue premium. Results of prior studies are mixed. The results of our study contribute directly to the recent accounting literature in which specific aspects of ethical corporate behavior have been explored (Fukami et al. 1997; Ittner and Larker, 1998; Ballou et al., 2003; Clarkson et al., 2004). We use firms listed by Business Ethics as ""The 100 Best Corporate Citizens"" as our sample of ethical firms. The univariate results of our study indicate a significant relationship between ethical corporate behavior and financial performance (i.e., greater profitability and efficiency, and lower cost of capital). The results of multivariate tests, controlling for prior year market value of equity, yield results that indicate a marginally significant association between being recognized as ethical in that year and market value of equity, but no association between being recognized as ethical at least one time and market value of equity. Nevertheless, given our study's findings of better financial performance and lower risk, we conclude that ethical corporate citizenship does indeed benefit a firm. © Copyright 2011 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accounting ethics; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility",

Whereas recent years have seen the burgeoning awareness of CSR in China, the corporate social performance (CSP) of CCFs is still unsatisfactory. The poor performance is attributable to many facets particularly including that CCFs are not well informed of CSR practices and thus cannot make due response to stakeholders' expectation. This research aims to identify what aspects can be taken for other construction businesses in China in the near future. Through comparing five major CCFs with four foreign enterprises, both excelling in CSP, it is found that CCFs' CSR has been carried in many China- and construction- specific ways. The research findings provide useful guidelines on construction business in CSR engagement, and lay a foundation for future studies in the area. © The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.","China; Comparative study; Construction contractors; Corporate social performanc; Corporate social responsibility","Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Project management; China; Comparative studies; Construction contractors; Corporate social performanc; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Contractors"

The purpose of the paper is to clarify and compare what these panels think motivates mangers to pursue CR from a positivist and normative perspective. We find that the three panels are in surprising agreement as to what they assume motivates managers to pursue CR and what should motivate the same managers. We also see a large discrepancy between what they think motivates and what should motivate managers. Branding, stakeholders, and value maximization are assumed to be key motivators, whereas sustainability and branding should be the key motivators.

This book argues that all companies must understand how and why stakeholders react to such information about companies and their actions. It examines the two most important stakeholder groups to companies – consumers and employees – to comprehend why, when and how they react to CR.

For a stadium development to contribute positively to the area in which it is built and maximize the benefits for a range of stakeholder groups, it is important that a stakeholder management strategy is implemented consisting of two key components: stakeholder engagement and stakeholder participation. This article presents a case study of the stakeholder management strategy implemented by Arsenal Football Club during the development of the Emirates Stadium. Based primarily on the analysis of documentary secondary data supported by a small number of semi-structured interviews, the case study uses the theoretical literature on stakeholder management as a framework. It evaluates the extent to which the football club considered the needs and interests of different stakeholder groups during the development of the Emirates Stadium. Case study analysis shows that the stakeholder management strategy consisted of resident consultations, a communications strategy, a Stadium Liaison Committee, a Stadium Management Plan, and supporter consultations. The case study concludes by emphasizing that the stakeholder management strategy implemented by the football club, while clearly demonstrating evidence of stakeholder engagement, did not extend further with little opportunity for stakeholder participation and a lack of opportunities for involvement in decision-making processes. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Arsenal; Football; Stadium redevelopment; Stakeholder Management",

This paper investigates the possible connection between CSP (measured by ethical rating) and CFP (measured by price-to-book-value) in a sample of international financial intermediaries.

Further, the perception of these notions can differ in the small-business world from the original academic definitions. This article focuses on the cognition of small-business owner-managers. Given the impact of small-business owner-managers on their ventures, corporate responsibility and ethical issues can take a different route in SMEs. The small-business owner-manager is able to shape the corporate culture and to enact values other than profit. Adopting a cognitive perspective, we have identified how the small-business owner-manager makes sense of notions linked to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business ethics. The concept of sensemaking has recently been applied to CSR (Basu and Pallazzo, 2008; Cramer et al., 2006). Applying a cognitive perspective to small-business owners may help in explaining specific phenomena found within small-business ownership. For this research, the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) is used, a method that has not previously been widely applied in the business and society field. Our findings to an extent invalidate the confusion in terminology found in the academic literature. Small-business owner-managers, pragmatically and rather clearly, differentiate among the various concepts related to corporate responsibility and business ethics but, at the same time, they recognise the interrelationships and interdependencies of these concepts. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how small-business owners think and integrate corporate responsibility and ethical issues into their decision-making. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; cognition; corporate governance; corporate social respon- sibility; entrepreneur; family business; perception; Repertory Grid Technique; sensemaking; small business; SME",

Design/methodology/approach: For the period 2008 to mid-2009, the author surveyed articles in mainstream media and business periodicals focusing on corporate social responsibility; reviewed polls for methodology and results; searched press releases for mention of corporate social responsibility; and interviewed professionals employed in the field. The author sought quantifiable examples of corporate financial support for programs in light of the recessionary economy. The author also looked to define today's corporate social responsibility as a philosophy reflecting the values of environmentalism, corporate transparency, community investment, diversity programs and other social benefits. Findings: CSR is a wide-ranging global movement advocating good corporate citizenship through such values as sustainability, corporate transparency, business ethics, workforce diversity, philanthropy, quality, service to community and workforce education. Even as corporations shed costs by the billions, CSR programs are thriving. The reasons are complex, but involve the conflation of CSR with environmentalism, and the apparent genuineness of corporate executives' commitment to its principles. Research limitations/implications: Research found fewer in-depth articles on the topic than might be expected, particularly articles providing or examining hard data. Practical implications: For those seeking to develop, sustain or evaluate a corporate social responsibility program, this article offers context, insight, and caution. Originality/value: The article suggests there is resilience to corporate social responsibility, in light of the durability it has shown in the current economic downturn. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cause marketing; Citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Economic cycles; Economic sustainability",

DNA is used as an extended metaphor to clarify and illustrate the workings of an organization and how sustainability may be implemented. This construct includes core ideology, dynamic capabilities, and societal engagement. The firm's DNA is communicated to both internal and external stakeholders, and stakeholders' concerns should be an influence on strategic marketing planning.

In a recent contribution to the Journal of Business Ethics, Brian Schaefer goes so far as to suggest that a proponent of shareholder theory cannot coherently and consistently embrace any moral position other than philosophical libertarianism. The view that managers have a fiduciary obligation to advance the interests of shareholders exclusively is depicted as fundamentally incompatible with the acknowledgement of natural positive duties - duties to aid others that have not been acquired by some prior commitment or transaction. I argue that Schaefer is mistaken. Positive duties are incompatible with the shareholder model only if we must contribute to their fulfilment in the corporate context; only if we have some reason to think that it is not possible or not permissible to discharge these obligations entirely in our private lives or through our various other roles and capacities. But we have no good reason to accept this. I argue that individuals are presumptively free to decide how and when to discharge their positive duties, and that buying shares does not cause this presumption to lapse. Hence a non-libertarian moral theory can be held without incoherence by a proponent of the shareholder model. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","aid; corporate social responsibility; libertarianism; positive duties; shareholder theory",

This could further lead to a set of indicators aimed at assessing corporate social performance as the maximization of the relational capability of people impacted by the activities of companies.

Waddock, for instance, defines corporate responsibility as ‘the strategy and operating practices a company develops in operationalizing its relationships with and impacts on societies, stakeholders, and the natural environment’. Inevitably, such definitions beg the question of how do we change corporations’ strategies and operational practices? What are the relevant issues and how are these issues addressed? While each company needs to find its own way in ‘managing’ its responsibilities, guidance is also provided by so-called corporate responsibility standards (e.g., the Global Reporting Initiative, Social Accountability 8000, the Fair Labor Association Workplace Code, and the UN Global Compact). Although these initiatives differ very much in their aim, scope, and operational procedures, they all recognize the essential role that business plays in building sustainable societies. © Mollie Painter-Morland and René ten Bos 2011.",,

Due to the cognitive ambiguity about new knowledge, the social relation network will play a very important role for the potential adopters' decision-making. So, based on social relationship network and utility threshold function, a new model is proposed to study how these factors such as social structural level, social word-of-mouth and social credit level affect the speed and extent of knowledge diffusion. Simulation results indicated that: Firstly, the higher the social structural level is, the higher the speed and extent of knowledge diffusion is, Secondly, the negative effect of word-of-mouth will slow down the speed and extend of diffusion. The more the adopters with negative word-of-mouth are, the greater the trend will be. Thirdly, not considering the cost of rebuilding the relation between different agents, the fixed relation structure with high credit will lead to incomplete diffusion. On the contrary, the unsteady relation structure with low credit will make full diffusion because of its more flexible information acquisition. © 2011 IEEE.","Knowledge Diffusion; Simulation; Social Relation Network; Speed and Extent of Diffusion; Threshold Model","Decision making; Electronic commerce; Government data processing; Social aspects; Credit level; Decision making process; Information acquisitions; Knowledge diffusion; New model; Simulation; Simulation result; Social relations; Social relationships; Threshold functions; Threshold model; Diffusion"

The dynamics of scientific and technical knowledge creates a new lifestyle for humans, because it can easily fulfil and extend their life ambitions. The development of science and technology thus acts as a stimulating innovation in the innovation process of human society. Unfortunately, there is a lack of incentive motivation to bring other innovative factors of social development to the pace of the dynamics of changes in technology. The reason is that the effects of technical innovations alone do not guarantee the complete satisfaction of the needs and interests of society, because the technical side of development contributes only to the development of measurable characteristics of human needs and interests. An example is management also improved by technology development, but only in its technical section. It accelerates and improves communication and even work with the information necessary for a manager's decision-making on changes, by which he / she responds to his / her earlier decisions that had already been superseded by development. Measurable characteristics of corporate events do not have the ability to predicate about their qualitative content. Any decision, as a change in the status quo, should comprehensively address the situation, not only in the field of quantitative development of corporate events, but also in proportion to their qualitative content, which creates a space for the application of ethics in management. Management without ethics enables to create a space for consumption behaviour of both individuals and society. The paper presents views on the effectiveness of ethics and the level of applications in business, and provides information on the status of ethics within the strategy of surveyed firms and institutions of public administration in the Czech Republic. The research discussed in this paper was conducted as one component of individual surveys, which were implemented at the Faculty of Management and Economics of Tomas Bata University in Zlín (FaME TBU in Zlín).","Business ethics; Consumer society; Entrepreneurial environment; Values","Behavioral research; Competition; Decision making; Dynamics; Knowledge management; Philosophical aspects; Surveys; Business ethics; Consumer society; Development dynamics; Development of science and technologies; Entrepreneurial environment; Technical innovation; Technology development; Values; Economic and social effects"

We address this question by examining a number of criticisms of the role that principles can play in moral judgment. Critics claim that reliance on principles requires moral agents to abstract themselves from actual circumstances, relationships and personal commitments in answering moral questions. This is said to enforce an artificial uniformity in moral judgment. We challenge these critics by developing an account of principle-based moral judgment that has been widely discussed by contemporary Kantian scholars. In so doing we respond to some basic problems raised by so-called ""moral particularists"" who voice theoretical objections to the role of principles as well as to contemporary business ethicists who have criticized principle-based moral judgment along similar lines.

What is the benchmark to prove their utility? Business Ethics and the Austrian Tradition in Economics is a treatise on the fundamental questions of business ethics and addresses significant shortcomings in the field. It is the result of correlating reflections on phenomena, resulting from an intersection of ethics, economics, methodology, and political and social philosophy. Sparked by the business ethicists’ tendency to consider certain areas outside their field and accept others unquestioningly, this book provides answers in the tradition of Austrian Economics and, in particular, of Hayek and Popper.Through detailed examination and reflection, this book presents the thesis that many themes in business ethics are discussed either unduly intensely, unbalanced or rarely, measured against what business ethics as a science should deliver. It does so by offering an answer to one of the most crucial questions in business ethics, namely that of justice in moral economic actions. Bouillon develops an original definition of morally just economic action in the course of three chapters, and subsequently uses it as yardstick, from which, in chapter four, he reads which of the relevant concepts and topics in business ethics ask for restatement. As a side-product Bouillon discloses logical inconsistencies in prominent political philosophies, and the consequences of these inconsistencies for maldevelopments in business ethics.Business Ethics and the Austrian Tradition in Economics illustrates and analyses the business etchics’ peculiarities particularly within German literature, providing the reader with a focus rarely found elsewhere.

Closely following the analysis approach used for similar studies in the economics and finance literature, we present the first study to examine whether there exists an empirical regularity in the bibliometric patterns of research productivity in the business ethics literature. Our results present strong evidence that there indeed exists a distinct empirical regularity. It is the so-called Generalized Lotka's Law of scientific productivity pattern: the number of authors publishing n papers is about 1/nc of those publishing one paper. We discuss the likely processes that underlie the productivity pattern postulated by the Generalized Lotka's Law. We find that the value of the exponent c is equal to about 2.6 for the comprehensive bibliometric data across the two leading business ethics journals. The observed research productivity pattern in the business ethics area, a relatively young discipline, is interestingly very consistent with those found in much older, related business disciplines like economics, accounting, and finance.

Design/methodology/approach: A framework is outlined and positioned incorporating an ethical frame of reference in the field of organizational chain management. Findings: A number of areas and sub-areas of corporate and business ethics are framed in the context across organizations. Research limitations/implications: The introduced framework should be seen as a seed for further development and refinement. It provides opportunities for further research of ethical concerns across organizations. Practical implications: Organizations may benefit from the findings and insights presented and they may be used to enhance their ability to manage, monitor and evaluate ethical business practices across organizations. Social implications: Changing societal and market patterns may enforce organizations to address ethical concerns across organizations. A myopic approach restricted to the judicial system may become insufficient and unsatisfactory from the perspective of other stakeholders of the organization. Originality/value: The framework makes a contribution bringing in ethical concerns across organizations, providing a basis for their ethical values and culture, as well as asymmetric relationships in terms of power and dependence.

At this early stage in what will require a profound transformation by the time it is complete, debate exists over which business and industry practices are most in need of change and how to bring these about: To what extent is it at the stage of waste management, air and water pollution control, or energy usage that policy intervention is best applied? Is it in production methods, product design, or the end products themselves that the most change can be realized? It is at the stage of consumption and usage of products that the strongest drive for change will come? Equally unclear is the best position for society to adopt in order to promote the most comprehensive while cost-effective transformation. Four broad approaches to this question illustrate the differences of opinion about how best to achieve industrial greening. They start with government imposing on all business and industry prescribed environmental protection technologies and methods of emissions reduction. A second, more flexible approach, would allow businesses to select their own most cost-effective strategies for reducing emissions, under the watchful eye of government. A third way is to use market-based incentives approaches that provide bottom-line rewards for environmentally-friendly business behavior, leaving change to the natural workings of the marketplace. The fourth is to rely largely on volunteerism, wherein businesses commit to environmental goals that match and/or exceed those required in exchange for relief from the prescribed technology and command-and-control regulations that would otherwise be imposed. Since the mid-1990s the amount of research on these approaches has expanded rapidly and heated debate has ensured about which approaches or mix of approaches to use. At one side of the debate, attention is mainly focused on the shortcomings of the nation's long-standing environmental policies-variously referred to as ""command-andcontrol,"" ""top-down,"" ""deterrence-based"" policies for air, water, land-use, noise, and endangered species protection-and the need to roll back these policies. Others focus mainly on the growing importance of the corporate responsibility and quality management movements within and across industries-domestically and internationally-and how this is moving many businesses towards a greener path. All reformers want to know how best to accelerate this trend through various flexible governmental and voluntary policies, particularly in light of the unrelenting challenges to the environment posed by modern technological society and a growing worldwide population. In assessing the contending positions and approaches, it is reasonable to assume that all else being equal, business and industry owners, managers, and workers would prefer to live and work in a cleaner, more environmentally-sustainable world. Yet seldom is ""all else equal."" The market economy in which businesses operate has a long history of freely using natural resources and nature's goods, such as clean air, water, and soil, food and fodder, and shielding both producers and consumers from the environmental pollution and resource degradation associated with the extraction of these goods, their use in production, and their consumption. This is the very same market economy, after all, that nurtures consumer tastes and expectations, ultimately their ""demands,"" for ever-more goods and services, resulting in the extraordinary material consumption of today's modern lifestyle (Princen, Maniates, and Conca, 2002). Consequently, the greening of industry is neither a private business matter nor a minor marketplace imperfection so much as a serious ""public"" problem, in need of a public policy solution. Since there are real costs associated with transforming into a green business we do not expect businesses to automatically or enthusiastically assume these costs. Indeed, it is typically in a firm's best interest to minimize if not avoid the additional costs of transformation to the extent that doing so does not demonstrably improve its near-term market position. This is precisely why the first generation of environmental laws, starting in the 1970s in the United States, were compulsory for all business, creating the ""command-and-control"" regulatory regime of the first environmental epoch. As this chapter shows, a good deal of progress resulted, but at great expense; arguably many unnecessary costs were incurred by both business and government, costs that arguably can be avoided under a different approach. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This paper seeks to frame ten effective implications/lessons of the most recent bank bailouts of 2007-2009 in the Western economy model when analyzing actual shareholders’ value retrenchment or growth opportunities. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a literature review and a re-conceptualized framework of event study methodology, secondary data analysis of qualitative and quantitative information. Findings – Recent bank bailouts relate to: global bailout interconnections, economic downturn and liquidity boost, abnormal returns, efficiency recovery, evasion of social costs, new opportunities for M&A, new risk management applications, opportunistic investors and eventually patience. Most important, findings recommend shareholders to grasp opportunities for bargains from bailout banks as well as to harvest their existing investments. At the same time, economic education and control become another important solution. Research limitations/implications – Consequently, as the paper targets most recent bailouts, a still ongoing event, there is a need for extended financial data that could enhance some cause-related solutions after economic recovery. Practical implications – The practicality of the paper refers to guiding management of both government and financial institutions on the choice for reasoning bank bailouts, providing some critical thinking views to investors as well as academics. Originality/value – Research or studies on the most recent financial crises bailouts have not yet been written, due to the process continuation. The novelty of the paper resides not in calculating ratios and interpreting them, but rather in looking more into some interesting strategic moves used to boost shareholders’ value. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Asset valuation; Bank bailout; Bank consolidation; Financial crisis; Financial management; Financial risk; M&As; Shareholders; Social corporate responsibility",

As scholars are calling for ""responsible leadership"" to become more of the norm, organizations are being pushed to enact new values, such as ""responsibility"" and ""sustainability,"" and pay more attention to the effects of their actions on their stakeholders. The purpose of this study is to open up a line of research in business ethics on the concept of ""authenticity"" as it can be applied in modern organizational life and more specifically to think through some of the foundational questions about the logic of values. We shall argue that the idea of simply ""acting on one's values"" or ""being true to oneself"" is at best a starting point for thinking about authenticity. We develop the idea of the poetic self as a project of seeking to live authentically. We see being authentic as an ongoing process of conversation that not only starts with perceived values but also involves one's history, relationships with others, and aspirations. Authenticity entails acting on these values for individuals and organizations and thus also becomes a necessary starting point for ethics. After all, if there is no motivation to justify one's actions either to oneself or to others, then as Sartre has suggested, morality simply does not come into play. We argue that the idea of responsible leadership can be enriched with this more nuanced idea of the self and authenticity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Authenticity; Ethical theory; Poetic self; Responsible leadership; Values",

We propose a dynamic model of responsible careers based on studying 32 individuals in the emerging organizational fields of corporate responsibility, social entrepreneurship, sustainability, and social investing. We describe six career practices - expressing self, connecting to others, constructing contribution, institutionalizing, field shaping, and engaging systemically. Observations suggest that development of these practices is influenced by four learning dynamics: people's perceptions of 'shifting landscapes' in which they seek to orient themselves, exploration and both biographical and systemic reflexivity. Our interdisciplinary and empirically grounded approach, integrating psychological intentions and institutional context, strengthens theorizing about responsible careers. The proposed model depicts responsible careers as continually evolving, sometimes precarious, and as dynamically enacted in relation to pluralist, shifting landscapes. © 2011 The Author(s).","Business in society; Careers; Charities/not-for-profit organizations; Interdisciplinary; Learning; Reflexivity; Responsibility; Social change; Sustainability",

Triple Bottom Line Sustainability (TBLS) as a desirable organizational goal is now generating some interest, and it is defined here, together with an exploration of the systemic issues which influence organizational attitudes regarding its achievement. Attention is drawn to lessons to be learned from how a learning organization, on either the local or global scale, might respond to the challenges of achieving sustainability. By exploring research and practitioner viewpoints bearing on sustainability-related promotion of organizational learning, and means to change industrial-age mindsets, this special issue aims to help organizations remove cultural and structural barriers to progressing sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: General sustainability-related concerns and challenges are reviewed, and individual authors voice their understanding of various elements of sustainability based on their research, their case studies, and the extant literature. Findings: Findings include enhanced understanding of how economic vested interests and political dynamics can block effective decision making in the sustainability field, even though the many sustainability experiences from around the world have provided practical means for companies to enhance their economic growth without affecting environments and communities. The impact of two different styles of leadership on the creation of a positive and a negative sustainability-enabling environment is explained, and it is suggested that having a better understanding of an organization's ability to adapt and self-regulate on crucial issues for sustainability may help to develop a path through the ongoing socio-ecological crisis. In addition, the importance of an organization having an extended view of its endeavors in corporate and business ethics is revealed. An action research study is also presented to show how organizations currently view and implement sustainability, and to identify which critical systemic components are yet to be seriously addressed. Originality/value: The opinions and research presented provide new and unique understanding of the elements contributing to organizational sustainability. Further value is added via the assessment of progress toward the sustainability ideal, the identification of barriers, and by studying the many practical examples of means to facilitate progress toward that ideal. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complexity theory; Corporate social responsibility; Ethics; Learning organizations",

The weak business culture and a symbiosis of business and politics have actually allowed for the bulk of self-serving and unethical decisions made by the Icelandic business and political elite. In order to illustrate this point, 10 expert interviews have been conducted within the period of 6 months in 2009 to support in-depth research carried out by the authors. The article also discloses questionable business practices that have recently come to the attention of the public both in Iceland and abroad and that ultimately facilitated the downfall of the Icelandic economy. While traditional corruption has probably played its role in this downfall, the measures currently employed to determine its level did not account for various peculiarities of Icelandic society. The article thus argues that there was a high level of corruption in Iceland, but it was outside of the traditional definition. This other corruption has ultimately prevented the government from acting appropriately upon the questionable business practices mentioned above. The article also offers some general recommendations which should be useful to both policy makers and business leaders wishing to engage in business activities in a transparent, ethical manner and learn from the tragic Icelandic experience. Among these recommendations are the necessity to recognize the limitations of current definitions of corruption, as well as a word of caution to commercial enterprises to pay a close attention not only to commonly accepted indices and mainstream reports but also to a country's history, culture, and political environment, prior to making any sort of investment decisions in that country. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business culture; business ethics; corruption; Iceland",

Based on a study of online auctions, we provide evidence that even respondents who have direct knowledge of the situation portrayed in the scenario may develop significantly different assessments of the level of unethical behavior. Further, those assessments may be conditioned in different ways by the same moderating variables. We conclude that care should be exercised when recruiting respondents to choose only those who can be expected to understand the scenario in its true context and that separate analyses should be conducted for groups of respondents who have different perspectives within that context. © 2010 The Authors.",,

After studying this chapter you will be able to: Understand the difficulty in defining globalization; understand how business ethicists engage with globalization; understand how the issue of relativism has dominated the discussion about globalization in business ethics; understand how continental philosophers have tried to reframe the discussion on globalization; understand that globalization is much more than just an economic issue. Introduction. Globalization is a challenging issue not only because there is hardly any agreement about what it is, but also because it raises so much moral and political dispute. Take the protests of anti-globalists during the G8 conferences, which were organized in cities like Seattle, Genoa, and Gleneagles. The protesters rallied against what they considered to be unfair trade, environmental pollution, or the exclusion of people from economic processes. They also took issue with the role that institutions such as the World Bank or International Monetary Fund play. These institutions stand accused of being the servants of multinational corporations (MNCs) rather than helping poor people around the world. Many protesters argue that MNCs have had a bad influence, especially in the poorer parts of the world. These companies are not just upsetting local economies but also sustaining corrupt regimes and plundering natural resources. It is no exaggeration to say that companies working on a global scale have the protesters, as it were, on their doorstep. © Mollie Painter-Morland and René ten Bos 2011.",,

Drawing on the theory of planned behavior we develop a conceptual framework of the drivers of proactive environmental strategy (PES) in family firms. We argue that family involvement in business influences the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of a firm's dominant coalition. Together these factors determine the extent of the dominant coalition's intentions to undertake PES. Further, family firms with lower levels of relationship conflict within the controlling family will be more successful in translating the dominant coalition's intentions to allocate resources for the pursuit of PES.

Two moderators reinforce the impact of environmental communication on brand equity through the strength of brand environmental associations: the perceived congruence between the brand and the cause, and the perceived credibility of the claim. Practical implications – In the context of greater consumer pressure regarding business ethics, managers should favour environmental arguments in their corporate communication to improve brand image through societal associations.

When organizations espouse their commitment to IAS but do not put forth the effort necessary to operationally enact that commitment, a ""credibility cover"" is created that perpetuates business as usual. In other words, the legitimacy that organizations gain by formally adopting the standards may shield the organization from closer scrutiny, thus enabling rather than constraining the types of activities the standards were designed to discourage. There is a lack of research on why certain types of IAS are more prone than others to being decoupled from organizational practices. Applying a neo-institutional perspective to IAS, we theorize that the structural dimensions of the types of standards themselves can increase the likelihood of organizations adopting IAS standards in form but not in function. © 2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

We argue that such decoupling of implementation from certification threatens the effectiveness of certifiable standards as governance mechanisms for firms' environmental conduct because standard certification may not accurately signal firms' superior environmental performance to external stakeholders. Empirical findings based on the ISO 14001 standard at the facility level support this view: Quality of standard implementation affects facilities' environmental performance, and environmental performance of certified and non-certified facilities does not differ significantly for the overall sample and low-quality implemented, while high-quality implementers have better environmental performance than their noncertified counterparts.

Compared to public firms, going private allows owners the potential to partition part of the residual risk to bond holders and employees, rendering them to be co-residual risk bearers with owners. We propose that new promotion-based contracts with bond holders and employees, reflecting their particular investments, be negotiated as the firm migrates from public to private status. These contracts should acknowledge the firm's intent to maximize shareholder value and its need to take the risks necessary to do so, but support that the firm's survival not be undermined due to its possibly opportunistic owners. ©2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Similarly, we argue that external contextual factors, including competitive intensity and technological turbulence, can influence organizational anomie. We extend anomie and ethics research by considering the impact of these firm cultural and environmental factors according to whether firms are publicly-traded or privately-held. Findings demonstrate that a number of firm cultural and environmental factors can generate or reduce anomie in firms.

The results show that in the early phase of adoption, regulative and normative forces within the institutional environment can work against each other. Results also show that regulative or coercive forces play a relatively more important role in the early phase of adoption of the standard than in the subsequent phases of diffusion. In the later phases of diffusion of ISO 14001, normative forces, such as the diffusion of other management standards, as well as factors related to trade, play a more important role. Because of the similarities between environmental management standards and corporate social responsibility standards, this study can help identify some of the challenges for diffusion of ISO management standards in the area of social responsibility. ©2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, accounting fraud in large corporations, and physical and sexual harassment in the military implicate not only the individuals involved, but the organizations and fields in which they happened. In this paper we describe such situations as instances of ""moral collapse"" and develop a multi-level theory of moral collapse that draws on institutional theory as its central orienting lens. We draw on institutional theory because of its explicit concern with the relationships among individual beliefs and actions, the organizations within which they occur, and the collective social structures in which norms, rules and beliefs are anchored. Our theory of moral collapse has two main elements. First, we argue that morality in organizations is embedded in nested systems of individuals, organizations and moral communities in which ideology and regulation flow ""down"" from moral communities through organizations to individuals, and moral ideas and influence flow ""upward"" from individuals through organizations to moral communities. Second, we argue that moral collapse is associated with breakdowns in these flows, and explore conditions under which such breakdowns are likely to occur. © 2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Ethical theory to most business ethicists means the traditional trifecta of consequentialism (usually utilitarianism), deontology (usually Kant), and virtue ethics (usually Aristotle). While this has been quite useful in the academic beginnings of the field, it is high time that we begin to connect these now traditional texts and arguments in business ethics with other traditions in the humanities. Business ethics was born in scandal. It seems to regenerate itself with each succeeding wave of scandal. And, there are two problems here. The first is that our world is so interconnected that we can no longer afford to see business as a separate institution in society, subject to its own moral code. Business must be thoroughly situated in society. This means that we can no longer accept the now rather commonplace narrative about businesspeople being economic profit-maximizers and little else. Business is a deeply human institution set in our societies and interconnected all over the world. The second problem is that business ethics, by being reborn in scandal, never escapes the presumption that business starts off by being morally questionable. It never seems to get any credit for the good it brings into the world, only questions about the bad. In fact, capitalism may well be the greatest system of social cooperation that we have ever invented. But, if it is, then it must stand the critical test of our best thinkers, if for no other reason than to make it better. Simply assuming that capitalism is either unquestionably morally good or unquestionably morally problematic violates both scholarly and practical norms. © Mollie Painter-Morland and René ten Bos 2011.",,

The paper offers a definition and operationalization of responsible leadership. The studies that have been conducted to develop the discursive responsible leadership scale validated the scale, discriminated it from other leadership scales, and demonstrated its utility in affecting unethical behavior and job satisfaction in organizations.

In attempting to fix meaning and the conditions of meaning epistemologically, however, critical realist and social constructionist positions tend to eschew such normative considerations and assert instead how the fixity of meaning is related to causal powers on the one hand, or to discursive habit on the other. In both cases there is an urge to extend from, and somehow complete, organizational experience by drawing what we call general lines. The critical realists do this by distinguishing the necessary from the contingent, the social constructionists by arguing language goes all the way through making such a distinction impossible. Enlisting arguments and concepts from Heidegger and Wittgenstein, as well as discussing the illustrative case of the rights and wrongs of cigarette production, we suggest an alternative normative framing for questions of meaning in which necessity and contingency cohabit, something we liken to the drawing of local lines. © The Author(s) 2011.","aspect seeing; business ethics; critical realism; rule following; social constructionism",

Introduction. Those in business have many reasons to be concerned about the way moral decisions are made. The success of business organizations depends on their ability to generate fair profit from their goods or services. For this to happen, employees must show up for work and labour diligently in the firm's interest, suppliers must keep contracts, customers must continue to believe in the value of the goods or services they receive from the corporation and pay for them on time, and shareholders must continue to trust in the corporation to invest their money in its pursuits. If in any one of these respects individuals or groups stop making decisions that are fair, honest, and trustworthy, the whole enterprise will fail. In what we have argued thus far, we have employed a form of reasoning that is probably the most influential in business ethics, namely consequentialist reasoning. Consequentialists argue that it makes sense to do the right thing because good consequences result from such decisions and behaviours. A very important presupposition that underpins consequentialist thinking is that people will always choose those decisions and actions that will best serve their interests. This way of thinking about human beings is called ‘rational choice theory’, and is used by practitioners in economics, management, philosophy, and psychology. Rational choice theory argues that given a choice, decision-makers will select optimal options in the pursuit of happiness, i.e. decisions are made based on utility. © Mollie Painter-Morland and René ten Bos 2011.",,

BC 427-347), discussions around leadership have been intimately linked to discussions about morality. For Plato, only people with the right moral character are capable of leading. This basic idea is still very much present in ideas (and fantasies) about leadership. Even today, some follow Plato when they take for granted that leadership is all about having a good character.

Justice has had massive uptake in Western society and culture over some thousands of years. With this longevity ‘justice’ is part of our normal lexicon and is an idea that forms the basis of some of the main national and international institutions that serve to govern our everyday lives. The breadth of juridico-political structures that regulates interactions between people in both national and global settings rests in one way or the other on the idea of justice.

Introducing agency theory. One of the basic questions that business ethics is concerned with is the question of who is responsible for ethical failures in the corporate realm. If we feel disappointed in the quality of products or services we have paid for, or feel that our return on investment in a certain corporation is not satisfactory, or when corporate actions harm the environment, we typically feel that some wrong was done, and we want to hold the wrongdoer accountable. Questions that inevitably arise include: ‘How was the decision to harm my interests made?’, ‘Was this done intentionally?’, and ‘Who should be held accountable for this?’ These questions all assume that someone intentionally decided to act in a way that harmed others, that this is wrong, and that someone must pay the price for such wrongdoing. © Mollie Painter-Morland and René ten Bos 2011.",,

Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using ""overnight"" costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes. If these trimmed costs are included, nuclear-generated electricity can be shown roughly 6 times more expensive than most studies claim.

Sustainable business success requires sustained existence in a corporation's political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental contexts. Far beyond the traditional economic focus, consumers, governments and public interest groups alike increasingly expect the business sector to take on more social and environmental responsibilities. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the model in which economic, social and environmental responsibilities are fulfilled simultaneously. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence that demonstrates genuine widespread adoption of CSR in practice, and its underlying reasons. Though research in CSR has been rapidly growing, its commercial reality and implications need to be further improved if it is to inspire corporations to voluntarily adopt CSR. In the literature, Carroll's four-dimensional (economic, legal, ethical and discretionary) CSR framework offers a theoretical basis for developing an empirically based model to explain why and how profit-motivated managers take up CSR voluntarily. Our study has developed a structural equation model to identify the key factors and their interactions that influence economically motivated managers to take on voluntary CSR, and validate Carroll's four-dimensional construct. The results support Carroll's four-dimensional CSR framework, with the exception of the link pertaining to the relationship between economic and discretionary/voluntary responsibility. This characterises the economic reality that financial market-driven economic responsibility does not automatically translate into social responsibility. Nevertheless, the empirical results demonstrate that corporations can be led to engage in more voluntary CSR activities to achieve social good when appropriate legal and ethical controls are in place. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carroll; corporate social responsibility; discretionary; economic; ethical; legal; sustainability; voluntary",

The findings indicate that only a small proportion of the companies have comprehensive privacy programs, although more than half of them voice moral or relational motives for addressing online privacy. The privacy measures they have taken are primarily compliance measures, while measures that stimulate a stakeholder dialogue are rare.

Introduction. Whistle-blowing has become an increasingly important issue in business ethics in recent years. In business ethics, as in sporting events, whistle-blowing is related to sounding an alert that the rules of the game have been broken. But unlike the referee in a football game, the person blowing the whistle in the case of corporations is not an objective, independent observer, but rather an employee or a stakeholder who reports the misconduct of a colleague or of the corporation as a whole. Whistleblowers are individuals who believe that there is a risk of grave harm if unethical behaviour is not brought to light. And in fact, the collapses of both Enron and WorldCom around the turn of the century made it quite clear what harm can result from unethical behaviour. In both the WorldCom and Enron cases, the whistleblowers were employees of the organization, and as it happens, they were both female. Sherron Watkins (Enron) and Cynthia Cooper (WorldCom) both did much to bring the dilemmas that whistleblowers face into the public realm. Though they could not prevent their corporations’ collapse, both were hailed as public heroes for their attempts to blow the whistle internally and for their strength of character in exposing their corporations’ misconduct. They both believed that in reporting their suspicions of misconduct, they acted in the interests of their corporations and their stakeholders. © Mollie Painter-Morland and René ten Bos 2011.",,

Introduction. The acronym ‘CSR’ conventionally refers to corporate representatives’ voluntary integration of social and environmental concerns into their business decisions. There is perhaps no other acronym that has become more prevalent within contemporary business ethics debates. Not a day goes by, it seems, where corporations and/or their representatives aren't routinely commended and/or condemned for demonstrating either too much, or else too little, CSR. The discussion over the appropriate level of CSR isn't only topical, of course: It is also an inherently controversial discussion defined by very little by way of consensus. And yet, for all of its inherent topicality and controversy, the nature of CSR is by no means something initially easy to grasp, despite its having been defined almost as many times as it has been mentioned. On the contrary, as will be demonstrated within this chapter, the very fact that CSR is both topical and controversial is a fact that makes its very meaning ever more fleeting and enigmatic. © Mollie Painter-Morland and René ten Bos 2011.",,

Its focus is on low-wage workers particularly, although the analysis holds for dependent stakeholders generally. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses and develops extant stakeholder theory with regard to employer treatment of low-wage workers. A general point is made about the need for stakeholder research, writing and advocacy to take more explicit normative stances. This is achieved in three stages: by explaining why low-wage workers are dependent stakeholders; by considering the strengths and weakness of stakeholder theory as an explanatory framework for low-wage workers; and by identifying how stakeholder theory should be developed in order to provide an explicitly normative account of low-wage workers that leads to pragmatic action. Findings: Labour and industrial relations scholarship would benefit from the integration of stakeholder language and scholarship, as the stakeholder concept has gained currency and legitimacy among academics in a variety of fields. Stakeholder theory scholarship would benefit from explicit consideration of power, which is common to work in labour and industrial relations scholarship. Originality/value: Stakeholder theory can benefit from labour and industrial relations scholarship and practice. Likewise, industrial relations can benefit from understanding and integration of the increasingly ubiquitous stakeholder concept. It is believed that the integration of stakeholder theory with insights from labour and industrial relations scholarship helps further work in both fields. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Industrial relations; Low pay; Management power; Stakeholder analysis; United States of America",

Authors like to imagine that people read their books out of passion for the subject matter or at least out of a curiosity regarding the new perspectives that the text may yield. Years of teaching have, however, made this team of editors more realistic. This book was more likely assigned by your teacher, and bought with hard-earned money squeezed from an increasingly tight textbook budget. You are most likely opening it now because your teacher assigned the introduction for your first class meeting, or because you are eager, or anxious, or both, to know what will be expected of you in this course within the next few weeks. The other possibility is that you are a teacher yourself, trying to determine what your students should spend their money and time on. It is therefore pointless to convince you that this book is worth the money you or your students have spent and the time that all of you will devote to reading it over the next couple of weeks. We cannot convince you, even if we tried. Reading books is a uniquely personal activity. The journey that reading this book will take you on is shaped by who you are and by what you bring to the table in terms of questions, passions, and expectations. The best we can do is try to explain why we went to the trouble of putting this book together. At face value, this book may look like a normal textbook. You will encounter facts, figures, tables, text boxes, learning goals, and all other things that one would expect from a decent textbook. Like many other business ethics textbooks, the material is interdisciplinary in nature. It aims to offer some philosophical perspectives on the business environment, and since it deals with the behaviour of systems and institutions, it draws on disciplines such as sociology and psychology as well. The global context in which businesses operate also requires the development of insight into political economy and cultural studies. The authors in this book therefore represent many different disciplines. They are also from different areas in the world. Some are philosophers, others are organizational theorists or business ethicists.

We argue that where principal institutions intersect (i.e., family and business); managerial perceptions of stakeholder salience will be different and more complex than where institutions are based on a single dominant logic. We propose that (1) whereas utilitarian power is more likely in the general business case, normative power is more typical in family business stakeholder salience; (2) whereas in a general business context legitimacy is socially constructed; for family stakeholders, legitimacy is based on heredity; and (3) whereas temporality and criticality are somewhat independent in general-business urgency, they are linked in the family business case because of family ties and family-centered non-economic goals.

Summarizing literatures and experience, this paper constructs a comprehensive classification standard which is constituted by five variables reflecting the migrant workers' actual migration behaviors. Then migrant workers' migration patterns are divided into two categories: temporary migration and permanent migration. On this basis, this paper gets the transformation's conditions from temporary migration to permanent migration using the two selection model firstly. The result shows that migrant workers' age and occupational types and living ways significantly impact their actual migration actions. Because the influencing factors of rural-urban migrants' migration willingness are researched in a lot of existing literature, the migration willing is included in this study. We construct the binary choice model in order to find the main factors affecting their willingness and actual actions simultaneously. The results show that their permanent migration probability both on their willingness and their actual actions is 29.12%; Age shows an inverted U-relationship with migration probability; The probability of permanent migration of the unmarried is significantly higher than the married. The rural-urban migrants who have high occupational types and own strong social relationships have more probability of permanent migration. To help them make their living conditions better may also improve the probability of permanent migration both on their willingness and actual actions. So, the cities' managers should take measures to promote migrant workers' occupational upward mobility, and help them improve their living conditions. These measures may improve the probability of migrant workers' permanent migration, thus speed up the urbanization process in China. © 2011 IEEE.","Migrant Workers; Migration Patterns; Permanent Migration; Temporary Migration","Electronic commerce; Government data processing; Choice model; Classification standard; Influencing factor; Living conditions; Migrant workers; Migration Patterns; Permanent Migration; Selection model; Social relationships; Speed-ups; Temporary Migration; Probability"

The construct validity of the extracted latent profiles was verified by their associations with multiple predictors (gender, age, tenure, social relationships at work, workplace satisfaction, and organizational justice perceptions) and outcomes (in-role performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, and intent to quit). The analyses confirmed that a model with five latent profiles adequately represented the data: (a) highly committed toward all foci; (b) weakly committed toward all foci; (c) committed to their supervisor and moderately committed to the other foci; and (d) committed to their career and moderately uncommitted to the other foci; (e) committed mostly to their proximal work environment.

A model is proposed depicting relationships among retailer market orientation, supplier market intelligence, supplier role performance, and retailer economic and social satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 99 chain store buyers and managers from 25 cities in China. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: A retailer's market orientation is critical for its own economic and social satisfaction by increasing supplier market intelligence (MI) and supplier role performance. Practical implications: Retailers' MO increased supplier MI and role performance. This study found that economic performance was more important in channel relationships than social relationships. Therefore, suppliers should focus on improving retailers' economic satisfaction through role performance and market intelligence rather than social satisfaction. Originality/value: Previous MO literature has focused primarily on the firm's performance and ignored the interactive aspect of business performance among channel members. The current study fills this gap by demonstrating the significant influences of retailer MO on supplier MI and on supplier role performance, as well as on retailer satisfaction - both the economic and social components. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to relate retailer MO, supplier MI, and supplier role performance to two types of retailer satisfaction - i.e. economic and social satisfaction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Market orientation; Retailers; Suppliers",

This assumed weakness turns out to be a strength in regard to leadership. Leading by values delivers a control modus under conditions of uncertainty, decentralises decision competencies and induces structural tensions, which have the potential to initiate reflexion and reform.

A value-laden concept such as sustainable construction, which emerges from a multi-stakeholder perspective, involves participation of the whole supply chain and incorporates the notion of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Creating sustainable habitats has societal as well as economic implications. While the UK government's Department of Trade and Industry is promoting CSR as a business contribution to sustainable development, many have argued that corporate citizenship takes shape at the point of government failure in the facilitation of citizen's rights. Recent research demonstrates varying degrees of corporate social performance (CSP) in different sectors and there are differing relationships between CSP and innovation in the real estate and construction sectors. A conceptual model linking corporate citizenship values (CCV) and CSP through corporate behaviour (BCORP) from a CSR and stakeholder theory perspective is developed. The proposed model presents avenues for future research and represents a significant first step towards modelling the important link between CCV and CSP. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Stakeholder theory","Conceptual model; Construction sectors; Corporate behaviour; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Department of Trade and Industry; Economic implications; Government failures; Multi-stakeholder; Real estate; Research agenda; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable construction; Construction industry; Research; Supply chains; Economic and social effects; citizenship; conceptual framework; construction industry; corporate strategy; stakeholder; sustainable development"

We also explore the idea that social relationships that enhance trust might facilitate more effective transactions, particularly in intermediate R&D markets where goods and services are fraught with uncertainty and contracts are particularly incomplete. We then turn to survey data collected from 131 Canadian firms that conduct R&D. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that, at the margin, partner quality is only weakly related to partner selection. Social relationships, on the other hand, seem to be an important determinant for partner selection when engaging the intermediate market, even after controlling for partner quality and partner location. Given that greater effectiveness in engaging the intermediate market may lead to significant productivity gains for R&D-oriented firms, we speculate that firm strategies and public policies designed to foster and facilitate trust may result in firm-level and regionlevel competitive advantage. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, represented by the Minister of Industry Canada, 2010.

This article firstly discusses the concept of external assurance as defined by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and its limited application to date outside the statutory financial statement audit. The article then discusses the experience of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) in applying the IAASB framework for external assurance in practice. The benefit of external assurance is primarily to enhance confidence in information for the benefit of users of information who have little control over its production. However, the benefit of external assurance potentially can extend beyond enhancing the credibility of information. Through a case study of developing an assurance reporting framework on internal control in the United Kingdom in 2006, the article firstly demonstrates the benefit of stakeholder engagement in the process. By taking part in collective decision-making over the scope of reporting and related responsibilities, stakeholders obtain a better understanding of the role of assurance reporting and thus are able to align their expectations. Collectively agreeing the basic elements of an assurance reporting framework also means that parties need not negotiate them along with other individual engagement terms, thereby saving time and cost. Secondly, where stakeholders decide to opt for an assertion-based assurance reporting framework, management reports on its internal control procedures and their effectiveness and professional accountants opine on management assertions. This assurance process can facilitate better governance as management explicitly owns primary responsibility over the information rather than attributing it to external accountants. The article finally considers the use of external assurance reporting in a wider context. Assurance services, conducted on a voluntary basis and outside the scope of a statutory financial statements audit, can enhance the credibility of specific information that is relevant to certain stakeholders without adding unnecessary burdens to others that have little to gain from this assurance process. This may be particularly relevant to financial institutions subject to increased scrutiny because of the recent crisis in the banking sector. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Assurance; ICAEW; Internal control; Reporting; Stakeholder; Standards development",

Safety processes can (and do) fail, resulting in injuries and incidents. Behavioural science uses data and analysis to come to conclusions about what is actually happening. Therefore, objectivity is at the core of behavioural science. This science of behaviour can help us produce more effective implementations of safety solutions. Behaviour-based safety (BBS) processes most typically involve careful observation of behaviour, feedback, and reinforcement designed to change behaviour in strategic ways. BBS processes recognise the workplace environment as the dominant factor in the creation of safe working. This focus on behaviour needs to be coordinated with the elimination of work hazards. The authors' basic premise is that workplace injuries are reduced when their causes are understood.

This is because people cannot be reduced to their function as workers. Thus, community is, at best, inoperative. This article takes Nancy's ideas of community and applies them to the notion of teamwork in business. It shows how in some literature on business teamwork, there is a desire to build a team through shared work experiences. It then explains Nancy's view as to why this cannot work, and it enters into Nancy's positive account of how a community should be seen as a web of people communicating and sharing with each other in a variety of ways. The practical conclusion the study draws is that team members need to be careful about allowing goal orientation to obfuscate the richness of the relationships that occur among team members.

After writing several books on the issue, submitting dozens of shareholder proposals and spending thousands on litigation, proxy issues and board campaigns, I am considering my work in an effort to see the way forward. Even when corporations fought every proposal to separate the chairman and CEO, or Sears spent millions of dollars to keep me off their board or the SEC issued no-action letters on proposals that were identical to those submitted in prior years, I kept pushing for greater corporate responsibility and self-regulation. Therefore, this moment after financial reform and Citizens United seems a good time to reflect upon the twilight of corporate governance and the failures of self-regulation - and where we go from here. This article examines 30 years of corporate self-regulation and its relationship to the recent economic crisis. If corporate governance is at a crossroads, what is needed to go forward? The business corporation has for some 30 years struggled with the challenge of regulating its own affairs and, thereby, liberating the unshackled genius of the capitalist system. Because the government has failed to define precisely the scope of the trustees responsibility with respect to portfolio companies and has signally declined to enforce the most blatant of fiduciary conflicts, a disincentive for responsible ownership has resulted. This has discouraged the conscientious and enabled disproportionate power for the ruthless. The struggle has, for the present, been lost as the various elements of corporate governance have failed effectively to make corporate power accountable to owners. In addition, as a result of government creation of investment funds and employee benefit plans, trustees whose authority can be derived from existing federal law now are the legal owners of controlling interests in the preponderance of publicly traded companies. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Accountability; Corporate governance; Oversight; Regulation; Responsible ownership",

We contribute to the literature by shedding light on the importance of a multifaceted formal ethical infrastructure-consisting of formal communication, recurrent communication, formal surveillance, and formal sanctions-as a crucial antecedent of moral awareness. In so doing, we discern how these four elements of a formal ethical infrastructure combine to collectively influence moral awareness based on a second-order factor structure using structural equation modeling. We test our model based on survey data from 805 respondents with significant work experience across three separate ethical scenarios. Our results across the three scenarios provide overall support for our model. We found that a second-order factor structure for the formal ethical infrastructure explains the variance among the four infrastructure elements and that a multifaceted formal ethical infrastructure significantly increases moral awareness. Our results further suggest a strong positive effect of moral awareness on moral judgment, which in turn was found to have a positive impact on moral intention. These results were substantiated when taking several individual and contextual control variables into account, such as gender, age, religiosity, work satisfaction, and a de facto ethical climate. Implications for theory, practice, and supply management are discussed. © 2011 The Authors Decision Sciences Journal © 2011 Decision Sciences Institute.","Business Ethics; Codes of Conduct; Codes of Ethics; Empirical; Ethical Decision Making; Formal Ethical Infrastructure; Moral Awareness; Moral Intention; Moral Judgment; Procurement; Recurrent Communication; Sanctions; Supply Management; Surveillance",

Design/methodology/approach - An examination of literature regarding survival and available support for small businesses is followed by results from a New Zealand-based empirical study of micro-business operators. Findings - Micro-businesses are the dominant form of business organisation and have an important role in maintaining a stable and sustainable global environment. Although such businesses owners tend not to have a formal education in business or engage with external support agencies, they need support from community-based networks. These networks could reduce the sense of isolation, whilst at the same time providing an opportunity for sharing experiences, in particular about problems encountered. Research limitations/implications - Implications for other jurisdictions may be limited as micro-business operators in New Zealand are relatively highly educated and the sample numbers are small (19 in-depth interviews and 91 questionnaire respondents). Practical implications - There is a need for psychological support for micro-business operators. Actions taken to increase their probability of survival and success are likely to enhance their interest in other aspects of the environment. Originality/value - This paper helps to fill a gap in the small business literature on the behaviour and perceptions of micro-business operators.

Further, it aims to examine the construct of moral intensity as a moderator of the P-O fit-commitment relationship as well as the P-O fit-job satisfaction relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 489 members of the National Purchasing Association in the USA, a structural model was examined in which it was hypothesized that corporate ethical values would be positively related to person-organization fit and P-O fit in turn would be positively related to commitment and job satisfaction. It was further hypothesized that the outcomes associated with P-O fit would be moderated by moral intensity such that high moral intensity would strengthen the P-O fit outcomes relationships. Findings: All of the hypotheses were supported. Research limitations/implications: All data stem from one data source, introducing the possibility of mono-source bias. Additionally, all scales use self-reports, introducing the possibility of mono-method bias. Practical implications: These results highlight the importance of corporate ethical values and moral intensity in building and maintaining an ethical and committed workforce. Originality/value: The findings of this study contribute to the ethics and P-O fit literature by establishing a link between corporate ethical values and P-O fit. It further construes moral intensity as a subjective variable based on the perceiver rather than an objective characteristic of ethical issues.

This article extends previous research by seeking to determine whether there is a relationship between emotional intelligence and ethical judgment among practicing managers with respect to questions of ethical nature that can arise in their professional activity. It analyzes the results of a survey of 324 managers enrolled in executive MBA programs from five universities in the southeastern and northeastern United States. This study is based on a model presented by Forsyth showing two dimensions that play an important role in ethical evaluation and behavior. Respondents were classified into one of four groups according to their idealism and relativism levels-situationists, subjectivists, absolutists, and exceptionists. The four ideological group's scores were compared. The results indicate significant differences between the situationists and absolutists on the one hand, and subjectivists and exceptionists on the other. The former's emotional intelligence scores were significantly higher thus demonstrating a strong relationship between emotional intelligence and ethical ideology. The results raise important implications for practitioners and educators. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Absolutists; Business ethics; Emotional intelligence; Exceptionists; Idealism; Relativism; Situationists; Subjectivists",

Yet, the relationship between law and ethics and its integrative role in defining values are often unclear. While integrity-based ethics programs emphasize ethics values more than law or compliance, viewing ethics as being integrated with law may enhance understanding of an organization's core values. The author refers to this integration of law and ethics as ""substantive ethics,"" analogous to the substantive law that evolves over time, which is applied to ethical breaches and carries sanctions for non-compliance. This article describes the integration of law and ethics as a mid-point between two polar views that define law and ethics either as having no relation or as being one and the same. Since corporations expressly state which laws they follow, a sample of corporate compliance statements is used to demonstrate this integrative mid-point. The sample also reveals that corporate ethics codes rarely express ethics and law as being integrated per se. Therefore, the author creates an example of a securities law compliance statement that is introduced with an integrative perspective of law and ethics. Perhaps such revised corporate codes will encourage corporate respect for both law and ethics and enhance ethical sustainability. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics and law; Core values; Corporate ethics codes; Ethical sustainability; Integrity-based corporate ethics programs; Substantive ethics",

Its modest proposal-a plea for a research agenda, really-is that we could reduce this normative asymmetry by borrowing from the normative framework of ""regulation"" to identify and justify an important range of beyond-compliance obligations. In short, we might think of ""self-regulation"" as a language and a normative framework with some distinct advantages over other frameworks like stakeholder theory, corporate social responsibility, corporate citizenship, and the like. These other frameworks have been under attack in the business ethics literature of late, primarily for their vagueness and their disappointing inability to distinguish clearly between genuine beyond-compliance moral obligations, on the one hand, and charitable acts that are laudable but not morally obligatory, on the other. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Beyond-compliance obligations; Business ethics; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Market failure; Regulation; Self-regulation; Stakeholder theory",

Then, we are offered a response to the diagnosis: charity in truth, ""the principle around which the Church's social doctrine turns, a principle that takes on practical form in the criteria that govern moral action."" (CV 6) In business ethics, the norms of personal and (especially) corporate responsibility are the natural correlates to ""the criteria that govern moral action."" Using this as a point of departure, I propose to relate some recent scholarship in business ethics to the message of CV-with the suggestion that there is significant convergence.

Taking as our starting point Levinas' demanding view of responsibility as 'following the assignation of responsibility for my neighbour', we use a case study of a packaging company-PackCo-to argue that a concern with being seen and/or seeing oneself as responsible should not be confused with actual responsibility. Our analysis of the case points first to the allure of programmes of strategic corporate responsibility and the ways in which, through identification, they can provide a tacit form of moral sanction to managers in their aggressive pursuit of profit. It then contrasts the responses of different managers to negative staff feedback to illustrate the difference between managers' attempts to defend their identity of being 'responsible' managers, and responsible conduct itself.

In this paper, I examine Hansmann's own argument in support of this view, in order to draw out its implications for some of the traditional concerns of business ethicists about corporate social responsibility. The centerpiece of Hansmann's argument is the claim that ownership of the firm is most naturally exercised by the group able to achieve the lowest agency costs, and that homogeneity of interest within the ownership group is the most important factor in achieving lower costs. He defends this claim through a study of cooperatives, attempting to show that homogeneity is the source of the competitive advantage most often enjoyed by shareholders over other constituency groups, such as workers, suppliers and customers, when it comes to exercising control over the firm. Some business ethicists, impressed by this argument, have taken it to be a vindication of Milton Friedman's claim that profit-maximization is the only ""social responsibility"" of management. I would like to suggest that this conclusion does not follow, and that the ""Hansmann argument"" lends itself to a less minimalist view, what I refer to as a ""market failures"" approach to business ethics. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cooperatives; Efficiency; Henry Hansmann; Ownership; Shareholder primacy",

While the primacy (descriptive or prescriptive) of shareholders is argued for in various ways, others seek to promote a wider stakeholder model of the firm and its governance. In both cases, the interests of creditors tend to be neglected. In this paper, the fundamental position of creditors in a system of corporate law that offers limited liability is reasserted and explained, and the implications explored. It is demonstrated that there are, in effect, two modes of governance possible for a limited liability corporation: the ""normal"" mode, when shareholders' interests are primary, and the ""distressed"" mode, when creditors' interests are paramount. As a result of this analysis, writers on corporate governance who are influenced by certain managerial myths or economic theories of the firm are encouraged to view the position of shareholders in a more informed light. Writers on business ethics, who often find themselves contending, perhaps implicitly, with inappropriate understandings of the nature of business corporations and their governance, are similarly alerted to the weakness of certain positions perceived as antithetical to their agenda. Finally, business ethicists who advocate a stakeholder perspective are encouraged to recognize the position of creditors and to pay more attention to them as a stakeholder group. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bankruptcy; Company law; Corporate governance; Creditors; Governance; Limited liability; Shareholder primacy; Stakeholder theory; Suppliers; Trade creditors",

We suggest that the existing governance structures are based on an outdated paradigm of business, rooted in economics. We propose an alternative paradigm, a more humanistic paradigm, which allows conceiving alternative, network-oriented governance structures. As hierarchical firms grow larger and more complex, the risk of failure increases from biases, errors, and missing data in communication and control systems. These problems are exacerbated by information overload on senior managers, directors, and their respective regulators. In contrast to traditional corporate governance, network governance introduces a division of power via multiple boards, checks and balances, and active stakeholder engagement. We argue that those features could have prevented the stresses and failures of financial firms in 2008, since they were anticipated by both individuals within firms and external commentators. However, those exposed to risks possessed insufficient influence in either governing and/or regulating firms to take corrective action. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate governance; cybernetics; decision making; economism; humanism; network governance; risk management",

Starting from an efficient versus responsive supply chain framework, we develop an integrative model that blends together elements of supply chain configuration, stakeholder management, and capability development. Specifically, we spotlight the dimensions of control and accountability that collectively determine stakeholder exposure, and show how this new construct affects the linkages between supply chain capabilities, configuration, and performance. In particular, this analysis reveals that the nature of stakeholder exposure determines how social/environmental technical and relational capabilities impact social and environmental outcomes.

Legislative evaluators working in auditing organizations were viewed less favorably than those working in other units; this appears to be related to their adherence to Government Auditing Standards that prescribe organizational independence.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 145 executives and managers interested in project management was conducted. Data were analyzed using principal components analyses with varimax rotation for both behavioral- and outcome-based items. Relationships between variables were analyzed via path analysis. Findings: In total, five sponsor behavior factors were identified including: ensure planning, clarify outputs, stakeholder relationships, support project, and appoint project manager. Additionally, three outcome factors were found: firm's future, meeting agreements (e.g. budgets, scheduling expectations), and customer success. An estimated path model testing the effects of sponsor behaviors on project outcomes indicated six significant paths. Research limitations/implications: This paper empirically identifies behaviors sponsors may use during project planning and the impact such behaviors have on project success measures. The exploratory nature of this study suggests further research to confirm findings. Practical implications: This paper provides executive sponsors with a focus during the planning stage when various stakeholders are determining many project details. Originality/value: The paper adds to the limited body of research on the role of project sponsors.

Many scholars believe that only humans can be moral agents, and therefore business needs to create models that foster greater receptivity to others through ethical dialog. This view leads to a difficulty if no specific person is the sole causal agent for an act, or if something comes about through aggregated action in a corporate setting. An alternate approach suggests that corporations are moral agents sufficiently like humans to be treated as persons, which leads to questions of intentionality and the organizational structure required to support the claim. In this article, I make an intermediate claim combining Goodpaster and Matthews' (60:132-141, 1982) view that a corporation may have a moral culture which affects subjective choices, with those of Painter-Morland (17(3):515-534, 2007) who points out that we should move from a model that posits discrete persons acting on each other to one where morality comes about through shared experience between agents who participate in each other's lives. I argue that the discussion has been trapped in traditional dichotomies, and is better served by language that more accurately represents the dynamic interplay between organization and individual. I underwrite this claim by looking at recent changes in British and American legal approaches to corporate responsibility. These provide greater incentives for owners and business leaders to encourage employees to discuss the reflexive nature of legal and moral responsibility in business, facilitate workers to voice their moral concerns, and create structures and processes that allow those concerns to be heard. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Affine agency; Corporate personhood; Moral agency; Responsibility; Teleopathy",

Findings demonstrate three levels of meaning and value negotiated by multiple actors in markets: cosmological principles, norms and standards, and individual judgments and interpretations. Discussion deciphers key overlaps and distinctions between meaning and value, operand and operant resources, and economic, social and environmental domains as they converge in market co-creation.

Qualitative research conducted in the US demonstrated the content validity of this measure of reputation. Quantitative studies with multiple samples of participants validated the simplified measure in different geographical locations and confirmed the measure's ability to assess perceptions across stakeholder groups. Specifically, the authors examined how the US general public thinks about companies, how Canadian doctors assess pharmaceutical companies, how US consumers rate energy companies, and how Danish transportation employees evaluate their own firm. To confirm its cross-cultural validity the authors collected and analyzed data from 17 countries from six continents. This article reports the results of these analyses, and demonstrates the reliability, internal validity, nomological validity and cross-cultural validity of the RepTrak Pulse scale as a short-form, etic measure of corporate reputation that can be used to facilitate cross-cultural research as well as online interviewing and survey-based data collection. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","corporate reputation; crosscultural studies; reputation measurement; scale development; stakeholder management",

Research Question: Is the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate social responsibility (CSR) contingent on satisfaction with firm performance? Research Findings/Insights: Our results suggest that while effective corporate governance discourages both positive (proactive stakeholder relationship management) and negative (violation of regulations and standards) CSR, higher slack and positive attainment discrepancy lead to higher positive and lower negative CSR, respectively. More significantly, we find that the association between effective corporate governance and both positive and negative CSR depends on satisfaction with firm performance as indicated by the levels of slack and attainment discrepancy. Put simply, the impact of corporate governance on positive CSR is more pronounced under low slack/negative attainment discrepancy conditions, and that on negative CSR is more pronounced under high slack/positive attainment discrepancy conditions. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study provides robust support for the behavioral theory of the firm. Previous research has not adequately considered the role of satisfaction with firm performance in studying the impact of corporate governance on managerial decision-making. We show that the association between corporate governance and CSR dimensions depends on differences in decision-making latitude originating from relative firm performance compared to those of peer firms. Practitioner/Policy Implications: First, to understand how effective corporate governance can constrain positive CSR and more importantly reduce negative CSR. Second, to appreciate that the effectiveness of an organization's governance mechanisms is contingent on slack and performance and the marginal returns from improving governance mechanisms when things are going well may be low. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Attainment Discrepancy; Behavioral Theory of the Firm (BTOF); Corporate Governance; Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Organizational Slack",

How then can this space for individual freedom, so essential in re-establishing responsible management, be recreated? In order to answer this question, we propose to interpret Jackall's MoralMazes (1988) from the standpoint of Blaise Pascal's Jansenist ethics and conception of humankind. Our discussion here of Pascal's ""reason of effects,"" his theory of ""double thought"" and his distinction between respect and esteem takes Jackall's analysis forward and opens new lines of thought about managerial responsibility.

It also aims to provide some clues to attain sustenance of business results. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a literature review using the internet and research databases (Emerald and EBSCO). Nine generic criteria are identified and their relative importance within each model is computed based on scores given to their respective contents in the criteria/sub-criteria of each EM/NQA. The average relative importance of nine criteria, discussions with experts and the author's own experience helped to visualise the emerging scenario and suggest improvements. Findings: EM/NQA frameworks have different shapes. Most EM/NQA start with the criterion ""Leadership"" and end with ""Results"". Ancient wisdom emphasises that the ultimate goal of business is the wellbeing of society. Although the criteria of EM/NQA are similar, the criterion weighting changes due to external environment and cultural factors. The study classifies nine criteria into core criteria, i.e. the need for survival, internal environment criteria, i.e. differentiators, and goodwill criteria, i.e. ensuring sustainability. The focus on goodwill criteria needs to be enhanced to ensure sustainable business growth. Research limitations/implications: This study is an attempt to integrate the common learning/contradictions of EM/NQA and provide clues to achieving sustainability. Many EM/NQA custodian websites have limited information in the public domain. A periodic review of models made this study difficult. Future research may focus on studying the impact of criteria weighting in different countries/economic environments to enhance the effectiveness of excellence models.

I argue that explicitly this document makes a call for a new theory of economic exchange. Whereas, the traditional scholastic theory of the ""just price"" was focused on ""the principle of the equivalence in value of exchanged goods"" (CV 35), a new theory of exchange must focus instead on ""a metaphysical understanding of the relations between persons"" (CV 53). True, Thomas Aquinas pioneered this new approach to the morality of exchange when he argued that the Golden Rule must take precedence over the logic of the just price: the relation between persons must trump the relation between the goods exchanged. Caritas in Veritate argues further for a new theory of exchange that combines elements of mutual gain with elements of gift-giving. Here again we see a revision of traditional scholastic theory in which every transaction was defined exclusively either as a unilateral gift (subject to norms of distributive justice and charity) or as a bilateral exchange (subject to norms of commutative justice). Benedict, by contrast, calls for a vision of economic life in which gift-giving and exchange are mixed, so that bargains are ""redolent with the spirit of gift"" (CV 37) in a new ""economy of gratuitousness"" (CV 38). I propose to outline a new theory of exchange in which the elements of mutual gain and gift-giving are combined. To do so, I shall have to revise the traditional scholastic analysis of the just price, which was focused on the equality of the goods exchanged and instead focus on the moral equality of the parties to an exchange. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bargain; Benedict XVI; Business ethics Caritas in Veritate; Catholic social teaching; Ethics and economics; Exchange gift; Just price",

The encyclical defines the framework for a new business ethics which appreciates allocative and distributive efficiency, and thus both markets and institutions as improving the human condition, but locates their source and reason outside the economic sphere. It places a clear accent on the ontological connectedness of the economic and ethical dimensions of human action. It is the proper ordering of means towards the end of integral human development that allows mankind to leave a vicious circle of consumerism and enter a virtuous circle that applies the creativity fostered by markets.

This process is illustrated through an ethnographic study that analyzed the evolution of employee perceptions during a three-year crisis-one that led managers to repeatedly postpone salary payments to save jobs. The process approach adopted by the study highlights important dynamics that traditional business ethics approaches overlook, such as the fragility of the construct of managerial responsibility, which cannot be coherent unless it is constantly renegotiated among an organization's various employee groups. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ethical judgment; Ethnography; Managerial responsibility; Negotiated order; Organizational crisis",

Arguments are made based on marketing, finance, and production theories that by engaging in socially responsible behavior the firm will increase sales, decrease costs, reduce financial risk, and increase profits, which will ultimately increase returns to the firm's shareholders. A model is developed of the mechanism by which modern production methods such as lean production and quality management result in sustainable corporate behavior that, in the long run, translates into higher stock valuations. The production effects cause marketing and financial risk effects that are complementary, and all three channels of influence synergistically result in higher stock values in the model. These effects also provide important benefits to other stakeholders of the firms including employees, customers, the environment, and the community. An important ethical issue in global supply chains is working conditions in foreign plants often leading to allegations of sweatshop labor conditions.

Specifically, individualistic, relational, or collectivistic identity orientations can describe a firm's level of CSP activity toward certain stakeholders. Family firms, we suggest, adopt a more relational orientation toward their stakeholders than nonfamily firms, and thus engage in higher levels of CSP. Further, we invoke collectivistic identity orientation to argue that the higher the level of family or founder involvement within a family firm, the greater the level of CSP toward specific stakeholders. Using social performance rating data from 1991 to 2005, we find that family and nonfamily firms demonstrate notable differences in terms of social initiatives and social concerns.

The effectiveness of these codes has been widely discussed on theoretical grounds and empirically tested in numerous previous reports that directly compare companies with and without codes of conduct.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether the existing audit regulatory framework adequately serves the legitimate interests of stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: This study is the first to collect survey data on audit regulatory issues in the post-Lehman Brothers environment. In total, 190 responses to a mail survey were collected from Big Four auditors and from 166 CEOs. Stakeholder theory is used to analyse these responses. Findings: The results indicate that Big Four auditors and CEOs perceive the disclosure of post-audit report event evidence to be important in discharging their ethical obligations. Both groups agreed that issuing timely audit reports is important, and that ""introducing quarterly audit reporting"" is a necessary step to enhance corporate governance. A risk-based auditing approach necessitates the introduction of quarterly reporting. The findings support the notion underlying business risk auditing (BRA) models developed in public practice and the literature. CEOs are acutely aware of their corporate responsibilities to the company's stakeholders, and demonstrate that they understand the core insights of stakeholder theory by applying this theory in the corporations they manage. These results support the assertion that stakeholder theory has managerial implications and intrinsic value. CEOs comply with their audit disclosure obligations in several ways. Based on the results, a refined stakeholder model is proposed and immediate regulatory reform is recommended.

Evidence of each of these sources of motivation is presented in this article. Findings also suggest that enhanced communication of CSR activities provides an opportunity to improve stakeholder accountability within a corporate governance structure and facilitate the development of relational partnerships and networks. © 2011 European Association for Sport Management.","Business of football; Communication; Corporate social responsibility; Football and the community; Stakeholder management",

The countries surveyed are Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. The diversity across countries in the region is high in terms of economic development, political structuring and human development. The degree of privatization and globalization is varied across countries since each of them is in a different phase of transition. In an earlier survey on Business Ethics, published in 1997, India was the only country from this region that was represented. In the current survey, 12 countries from the South and South East Asia are represented. While Business Ethics in academia is widely present, Corporate Social Responsibility, Governance and Sustainability though relatively new appear to be growing rapidly. Business Ethics courses tend to focus on functional ethics, managerial ethics and implementing codes of ethical conduct. Across the 12 countries, Business Ethics is taught either as an elective or a core course in most institutions. Training emphasis across countries is varied. While training institutions in India appear to be high, the presence of multinational consultants in Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is significant. The research focus across countries in the region is weak. The high convergence on the top issues in Business Ethics, across respondents in different countries, is worthy of mention. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Asia; Business; CSR; Ethics; Research; Teaching; Training",

The investigation done shows that, in general terms, LA is not much developed in the BE field. Analysing the most important findings it is possible to conclude that more topics are being studied and that activities are growing in the field of BE in LA. However, it is also clear that the field of BE remains clearly underdeveloped in the region. BE is addressed by only a few business schools in each country and a small number of NGOs in LA. In addition, until now little rigorous research has been conducted and publications in prestigious academic journals have been scarce. Studies in BE are still relatively rare and very locally focussed. From another perspective, there is a great difference in the level of activity across countries in the LA region. When looking at the future, corruption appears as the major concern, almost certainly due to the political, social, and ethical context that many of the nations in the region are experiencing. There is a strong need for more business schools and NGOs to join the task of researching, teaching and training in the broad spectrum of areas that fall within the scope of the field of business and economic ethics.

At that time, business ethics was still dominated by a mainly philosophical, normative analysis of business issues with a maximum of 25 chairs in business ethics all over Europe. It has since expanded dramatically in numbers as well as diversified into many different domains. We find this rich diversity in the conception of business ethics back in the answers of our respondents to every single question. The concepts they propose, the courses they teach, the subjects under research as well as the training and consultancy offered to clients and even the challenges for the future all reflect this diversity. Decisive for the expansion of business ethics in Europe has been the advance of CSR and the official backing of CSR by the European Commission. We further argue that the prevalence and importance of business ethics and CSR differs throughout Europe. A rough approximation based on our survey results and literature review is that it is more important and more developed in core and Nordic European countries and somewhat less in Southern and Eastern European countries.

One tendency noted in the literature is that CR communication is organised and structured. Corporations tend to professionalise CR communication in the sense that they provide information that corresponds to demands for transparency that are voiced by certain stakeholders. This also means that experts within the firm tend to communicate with professional stakeholders outside the firm. In this article, a particular aspect of the organisation of CR communication is examined, a phenomenon that we refer to as the 'filtration effect'. By comparing CR communication in parent companies and their subsidiaries, we show empirically that there is considerably less CR communication on the subsidiary level compared to the parent level. We see filtration as a sign of conscious organising of CR communication that implies particular attention to certain stakeholder groups with clearly defined demands and expectations on companies. The strong filtration effect noted in the study suggests that CR communication does not seem to be very much adapted to customers, which may be problematic both from a communicative and ethical perspective.

How many should they target? How to allocate attention/efforts among them? Based on stakeholders and market orientation research this paper aims to address these dilemmas. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a survey of managers in a cross-industry sample of 115 firms. The authors first identify a specific group of salient stakeholders - those providing the firm with revenues and financial support. The article then studies the conditions under which firms should adopt a key approach to stakeholders' management - a ""generalist"" stakeholder strategy, that is, deal with a larger number of revenue and funding producing stakeholder types, and/or more evenly spread attention/efforts among them. Findings: The findings suggest that a generalist stakeholder strategy has a positive effect on firms' performance among resource-rich firms and among firms who face dissimilar (""unrelated"") stakeholders. Also, degree of environmental volatility was not found to moderate the relationship between a generalist stakeholder strategy and firms' performance. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the marketing and stakeholder literatures by identifying and studying a group of important stakeholders beyond final consumers - those providing the firm with revenues and financial support, and by studying the conditions under which firms benefit from one key approach to stakeholders - a ""generalist"" stakeholder strategy. The study's limitations characterize most cross-sectional survey research (e.g. single informants, subjective performance assessments). However, substantial efforts were made to ensure the validity and robustness of the findings. Practical implications: The study offers managers insight into the organizational and environmental conditions under which firms should adopt a generalist stakeholder strategy. Originality/value: This is one of the few papers that integrate into the marketing literature the study of stakeholders. Specifically, it introduces the concept of a generalist stakeholder strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumers; Management strategy; Marketing strategy; Stakeholder analysis",

On one hand, within insurance practices 'risk' is always defined in technical terms. It is related to monetary measurement of value and to statistical probability calculated for a limited population. On the other hand, and at the same time, insurance has an inherent connection to solidarity. When taking out an insurance, one participates in the risk pool within which each member is reciprocally responsible for others' risks. The combination of technical controllability and solidarity has made insurance a successful tool for governing welfare societies during the twentieth century. From the point of view of business ethics, it is interesting that, as we argue in this article, the connection between insurance and solidarity is not limited to social welfare assemblages, but is evident in relation to private insurance as well. At the same time, however, it is important to understand that insurance does not advance all forms of solidarity. Hence, this theoretical article analyzes the specific conceptions of solidarity that the different forms of insurance practice produce. Particular emphasis is put on the distinction between 'chance solidarity' and 'subsidizing solidarity'. The main questions of the article are: What kinds of conceptions of solidarity are built in the insurance technology? And how are the limits of solidarity defined and justified in different forms of insurance? © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chance solidarity; Insurance; Life insurance; Risk; Risk technologies; Solidarity; Subsidizing solidarity; Welfare",

It seeks to investigate specifically the influence of personal, psychological and psychosocial determinants of preferences for retiring later. Additionally, the study presents a typology of different retirement preferences based on psychological and psychosocial variables. Design/methodology/approach: The data are based on questionnaires from 556 employees of a UK financial services organisation (aged 40-60) and measures include psychological expectations of retirement (expected adjustment to retirement, attitudes towards leisure and social interaction), psychosocial attitudes (job satisfaction, intrinsic motivation, organisational comment and work commitment) and attitudes towards working beyond normal retirement age. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted and one-way ANOVA was conducted to identify differences between groups. Findings: The data show very negative attitudes towards working later than the normal retirement age and that expectations of adjustment to retirement were the most significant predictor towards retirement preferences, followed by work commitment. Significant differences in retirement attitudes and intentions were found between different groups of employees. Practical implications: Some of the practical implications of the work suggest that retirement preferences are shaped only to a moderate degree by psychosocial attitudes. In seeking to retain older workers in the workforce for longer employers should encourage employees to develop strong social relationships at work and allow gradual transitions to ultimate retirement. Originality/value: The paper looked at preferences for retirement, particularly later retirement, and found that, if employers wish to retain the knowledge, skills and expertise of their employees, then it would seem that they need to devise means of allowing people to achieve some of the more desirable aspects of retirement (greater free time, opportunity to pursue hobbies and interests) at the same time as retaining some of the benefits of work (status, professional interest, income etc.). Phased and flexible retirement initiatives therefore seem to be one of the solutions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Individual psychology; Older workers; Retirement; United Kingdom",

It suggests that the complexity of development competitions derives from their inherent tension between promoting creativity and financial viability. This cannot be resolved without careful and even-handed management of the competition by the place promoter, who is usually a private- or public-sector landowner. To encourage high quality design and ensure developer participation without wasting resources, place promoters should themselves take responsibility for masterplan preparation, stakeholder engagement and the provision of common technical information. Competitions should be informed by market realism, not burdensome rules and regulations. Place promoters also need to remember that developers are primarily interested in maximising short-term receipts and should therefore ensure that this does not compromise the long-term place quality sought by property users and investors. Competitions thus do not provide simple solutions to design challenges, but require careful thought and management to succeed. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Competition management; Design creativity; Developer objectives; Development competition; Landowners; Masterplans; Place promoter; Procurement strategies; Property investors; Property users",

The study follows Bushee (Account Rev 73(3):305-333, 1998) in categorising institutions as dedicated or transient. The demand for shares is organised according to three factors: a long-term factor, corporate responsibility; a short-term factor, market liquidity; and a time-independent factor, portfolio theory. The rank and importance of the factors for the different types of institutional investor are analysed. For one of two types of dedicated institution, corporate responsibility is as important as portfolio theory in influencing the demand for shares. For all dedicated institutions, corporate responsibility influences the demand for shares more than market liquidity. For two of the three types of transient institution, market liquidity is the most important factor in share selection. For all transient institutions, the least important factor is corporate responsibility. Findings suggest that corporate responsibility positively and significantly influences the demand for shares by dedicated institutions. The discussion considers the extent to which these trends are constitutive of significant shifts in ethicality within the context of institutional investment. Looking at this from within a highly institutionalised Anglo market model, dedicated institutions' commitment to broader and longer-term concerns could be interpreted as a small but significant step towards a more axiologically informed ethical business practice. Such a form of engagement calls for sensitive attention to a fuller range of features deemed to be relevant to investment decisions, as opposed to more narrow reliance on legislation, codes of practice and fiduciary principles. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; corporate responsibility; institutional investment; share ownership",

It is predicted that the variables' company size, amount of philanthropic expenditure, region and industry influence the extent to which the various impact dimensions of philanthropy are measured. Though unexpected considering the lack of common practice in impact measurement, it is found that between 62 and 76% of the DJSI firms measure some sort of impact of their philanthropic activities, mostly impact on society and impact on reputation and stakeholder satisfaction. The number of firms that measure impact increases over the years and so does the number of firms that measure multiple dimensions of impact. Consist with our predictions, we find that larger firms and firms with relatively higher philanthropic expenditures are more likely to measure impact.

This paper explores the negotiations that arise when such souvenirs (material objects from the exotic, extraordinary, temporary place of tourism) are implanted in the usual, ordinary place of 'home'. It is argued the 'placement' of souvenirs in the home stems from the 'place' the souvenir holds for owners, via their enmeshment in social relationships, processes of fetishization and questions of authenticity. This paper asserts that 'banal' souvenirs (tea towels, bookmarks, food and drink) however 'ordinary' in appearance, and alike to items usually found at home, are just as likely to be placed in significant ways as supposedly authentic, hand-crafted souvenir goods.

Both used a comprehensive approach to stakeholder engagement, using a transactive planning approach that sought to establish a participatory and inclusive framework for stakeholders to engage in multi-loop learning and corresponding action to achieve sustainable tourism planning outcomes. A seven-stage stakeholder engagement process was used, bringing together stakeholder consultation workshops, setting up a destination planning website to accept broader community input, as well as creating Stakeholder Reference Groups and citizen's juries. The process continued with consultation reports, workshops, draft plans and the communication and implementation of the final plan.

Previous literature, maintaining the need for a marketing approach to festivals, identifies the need for maintaining strong stakeholder relationships in order to succeed in a business environment; attention has been focused to the theory of relationship marketing (RM) because of the recognition that this practice is complementary to the marketing of festivals. The very nature of the music festival as an annual, usually, 4-day event means that effective marketing is needed to keep connections with the consumer throughout the year. This article focuses on the RM techniques utilised within the music festival industry from the viewpoint of the festival organiser in an attempt to establish how festival organisations value and monitor organisational relationships. This article explores the extent to which these relationships are valued and managed; furthermore, the variations between these intricate relationships are considered by focusing on those held with the organisation's consumers and sponsors, the results of which have provided the ability to establish the importance and relevance of RM to the industry and further identify the marketing communication methods employed to establish and maintain such relationships. In-depth, convergent interviews have been conducted with a segment of music festival organisers from a range of events. The results have been integrated with the study of current literature to best exemplify these issues. It has been established that RM has a strong role in today's commercial and independent music festival industry; technological advances are enabling the organiser to support online relationships further and increase consumer loyalty.

Jim Kranger, CEO of the Victorian Major Events Corporation, is put in charge of assessing the value of the event to the State of Victoria. The results of Kranger's report will determine whether the government will continue to financially support the event. Kranger realizes that he must consider economic, social, political, and environmental issues. The case highlights the challenges that Major Events Corporations, and by extension, the government face in providing public funding to a sport event. The case also highlights the problems with economic impact studies and the need to focus on the triple bottom line approach by examining the economic, social, and environmental issues associated with the event. Further, the case highlights issues relating to the use of secondary data sources to make decisions.

The paper argues that sustainability and corporate social responsibility are the key drivers of value resonance and service excellence. A case-study approach is used in the context of retail service providers, and the main case is the furniture company IKEA. Key values of our case are identified, analysed, and compared with values in other companies. The findings suggest that the innovation management of these firms has been characterised by: (1) business platforms (such as physical and web-based experience rooms) that facilitate their customers' service experiences; (2) service brand and marketing communication based on values resonance among the norms and ethical values of customers, the company, and the wider society; and (3) sharing of corporate values among leaders and employees to provide energy and direction for excellence and sustainable business development. A new framework known as 'The business model of service excellence and innovation - known as the service excellence and innovation (SEIB) model' is developed. The new framework focuses on how to create and manage resource configurations that enable, support, and direct customers in value co-creation and service exchange. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Business model; Corporate social responsibility; Innovation; Service excellence; Service-dominant logic; Sustainability; Value creation; Values",

To better understand this controversy, this paper rigorously examines three key theories from a frame-critical and business ethics perspective. It introduces a fundamental threefold conceptualisation of 'employment equity policy' (EEP) as a catch-all term for related concepts such as 'affirmative action', 'equal opportunities policy' and 'diversity management', distinguishing between three different organisational goals: equal treatment, equal results and individual recognition. The analysis suggests that different authors emphasise some 'facts' rather than others and strategically interpret the limited available empirical research to support their policy positions, mixing both classical and newer ethical reasoning. In the 'good practice' frame, human resource management practitioners are urged to take 'positive action', to monitor the ethnic composition of the workforce and to formulate target figures to increase the representation of discriminated groups. In the opposing 'bad idea' frame, organisations are seriously advised against EEPs with 'hard' numerical goals: these policies supposedly are unnecessary and ineffective and have negative unintended consequences. The article draws implications from these findings for future research and practice in the field of EEPs. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Affirmative action; Business ethics; Diversity management; Employment equity; Ethnic discrimination; Good practice",

Design/methodology/approach: As a conceptual/viewpoint piece, this paper recognizes that for ethics education to be successful, individuals and corporations must have an appreciation of their role in the society at large. In addition, there needs to be preparedness on the part of the corporation to engage in an ethical manner with the marketplace with which it interacts. Findings: Ethics education should not exist in a vacuum, that is just within the organization, but it should reflect the values of the organization as they impact upon and are impacted upon by society in general. Research/limitations/ implications: This model is predicated on a belief that organizations must craft their ethics education program with as much care and enthusiasm as they craft their strategic plan. The employees are the organization's representatives and they need to be made as clear as one can make them as to the ethical philosophy of the company and what is expected of them. Adults have a capacity for greater reasoning and reflection on their life experiences than children and thus the concept of ""andragogy"" provides a more satisfactory method to fashion education programs for adults than some more traditional methods that focus on training and not education. Practical implications: When considering the ethics education of its employees, corporations need to place that education in context as it relates to the organization and the wider society as a whole. It is suggested that an ethics education program needs to provide a framework for understanding the concepts of ethics and moral development. Using this framework as the basis for the education offered, the education program is then expanded into an examination of a range of ethical issues presented in a variety of ways. Originality/value: This paper proposes an integrated way to approach ethics education that ensures that the antecedents of the program are considered in the context of the ethics of individuals, the society and in turn the organization, hence the holistic approach. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Education; Organizations; Teaching",

The goal is to show that while consumer segments exist as abstractions (and thus come to have a life of their own within marketing discourse and practice), their constitution and persistence occurs within a messy matrix of social relationships, with attendant obligations, attachments, and desires. This is an examination of ways consumer segmentation practices enmesh and sometimes ensnare those closest to their production and whose persistence is grounded by embedded cultural assumptions about consumption. By focusing on the microcosm of interactions - the phone calls, e-mails, conversations, report texts - it hopes to illuminate the fodder with which practice and ideology are coconstituted in real time. © Oxford University Press, 2013.","Consumer research; Consumer segmentation; Cultural analysis; Ethnography; Market research",

The framework builds on a typology of sustainable entrepreneurship, develops it by including social and institutional entrepreneurship, i.e. the application of the entrepreneurial approach towards meeting societal goals and towards changing market contexts, and relates it to sustainability innovation. The framework provides a reference for managers to introduce sustainability innovation and to pursue sustainable entrepreneurship. Methodologically, the paper develops an approach of qualitative measurement of sustainable entrepreneurship and how to assess the position of a company in a classification matrix. The degree of environmental or social responsibility orientation in the company is assessed on the basis of environmental and social goals and policies, the organization of environmental and social management in the company and the communication of environmental and social issues. The market impact of the company is measured on the basis of market share, sales growth and reactions of competitors. The paper finds conditions under which sustainable entrepreneurship and sustainability innovation emerge spontaneously. The research has implications for theory and practitioners in that it clarifies which firms are most likely under specific conditions to make moves towards sustainability innovation.

Using content analysis of annual reports, corporate websites and other corporate communications, a summary of current practices has been identified and compared with recent studies of global trends and best practices. It is clear that the organisations considered are aware of the CR agenda with widespread adoption, but they have some way to go before catching up with the global leaders.

We reveal an apparent disconnect between the focus on sustainable products and processes and the orientation of the businesses within which they reside. Current agendas are characterised by a desire to create a more sustainable built environment, but with little regard for the businesses that enact such agendas. We argue that the firm is the enabler of a more holistic CSR agenda, and that sustainability needs to be present, visible and integrated in the business at all levels and in all functions of the sustainable construction organization. An archetype of a sustainable construction business is developed based on a synthesis of related literatures that could act as a framework for enacting responsible strategies in the future. In arguing for a 'business focus' we seek to broaden the current debates within the sustainable construction literature, and to open up new research trajectories around responsible sourcing, business ethics and organisational change for corporate sustainability, which have hitherto been underplayed within built environment research literature.","Construction business; Corporate strategy; CSR; Sustainability",

This concept is illustrated through a case study. Design/methodology/approach: The understanding of humanism applied is one drawn from Catholic social teaching. The case has been developed from the personal experience of one of the authors (Mammoser), enriched with interviews and reports, along with some public information, which helps to understand the socio-cultural context. Findings: HCCI is defined by four characteristics: recognizing and respecting human dignity and rights, fostering integral human development, acting virtuously; this means that the social actions included in CCI have the direct motive of doing good, and organizing social actions in accordance with both the Principle of Solidarity and the Principle of Subsidiarity. The specification of these characteristics can vary from one situation to another. Here we discuss a real case in which these characteristics underlie a successful project in the USA, jointly developed by the US company Walgreens and the Midtown Educational Foundation, a Chicago-based NGO. Research limitations/implications: The case study does not seek to suggest that this is the only way for CCI with a humanistic approach, but to shed light on and motivate other similar initiatives. Practical implications: Findings provide new horizons to undertake CCI and a project, which could be included within the best practices in this field. Originality/value: The paper provides a new approach to CCI based on a humanistic perspective, which enriches other approaches. In doing so, it does not consider such involvement as a means for public relations, reputation enhancement, and ultimately profits.

Specifically, we claim that corporate social performance may be a function of board attributes and we investigate the association between board reputation - in terms of board composition, competence, diversity, leadership, structure and links with the external environment - and the social performance of firms, after controlling for other companyspecific characteristics. In order to explore such a relationship, we analyse the association between corporate social performance and board reputation of the Business Ethics 100 Best Corporate Citizens over the period 2005-2007. Data on corporate social responsibility are collectedfrom the KLD's SOCRATES database, which is derived from multiple sources and is not dependent upon corporate self-reporting. Data on board reputation are hand-collected from corporate reports and proxy statements. Our empirical evidence shows that the proportions of independent, community influential and female directors are positively associated with corporate social performance, while the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee is positively associated with community performance. In contrast, we find that CEO duality and community influential directors with multiple directorships have a negative effect on corporate social performance. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Board of directors; Community influential directors; Corporate social performance; Stakeholder theory; Women on the board",

With a sample of 80 different Australia-based firms, we have examined various parameters attributing to corporate sustainability and have arrived at three kinds of performance outcomes (factors) that concur with triple bottom line principles, which we term as: 1 corporate environmental performance outcome (CEPO) 2 corporate social performance outcome (CSPO) 3 corporate financial performance outcome (CFPO). The results of the ANOVA analysis of these factors against business size have been discussed and the significantly higher CEPO in large size businesses than in small or medium size businesses have been explored.

This reconstruction aims at a deconstruction of certain axioms of neoclassical economics that hamper contemporary efforts in integrating ethics firmly into management education. I intend to show by these deconstructive endeavors that a constructive use of the idea of responsible freedom could correct and complement the current quantitative focus in business theory through qualitative orientations.

Second, we highlight the measurement level of the underlying data screens as an important determinant of the actual effects of CSP on CFP.

These questions were included in a questionnaire sent out annually to the 2,500 largest companies by market cap within the Dow Jones Global Index by an independent Swiss-based asset management firm.

In practice, however, conflict has often entered into union-NGO relations, weakening the protection of workers' rights. We argue that cooperative union-NGO relationships are difficult to form in part because of the differences existing between how unions and NGOs organize.

Contact was established with the Good Business Journey Manager of Woolworths when issues in the publications needed further clarification. Findings: Sustainable business practices are often regarded as a statutory expense in order to meet government legalisation requirements. This case study demonstrates that a business can voluntarily decide to be sustainable and it can use this approach to drive innovation, build its brand image and increase efficiencies and cost savings within the business. Research limitations/implications: Businesses can be sustainable even in developing countries.

Many commentators on post Communist transformation focus their attention on dysfunctional corporate governance and the deleterious consequences of liberalisation on business ethics. Poor business ethics and bad corporate governance may be a consequence of labour exploitation for comparative advantage, and the abandonment of party authority. This allowed rapacious rent-seeking by a minority well placed to benefit from the newly de-regulated regime. A by-product is a burgeoning informal economy encouraged by insider dealing of privatised state assets. State regulation, where it exists, is often ignored. Employment relations are fragmented, with state-owned enterprises retaining some form of collective regulation, while newly privatised enterprises seek to marginalise union activity. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses why Serbia has diverged from the Slovenian case in the former Yugoslavia and determines norms of behaviour as a product of both structural and agency dynamics. Evaluates the Privatisation Agency's programme and reviews documentary evidence on business transparency. Records evidence of labour disputes from trade unions, press reports, semi-structured interviews with trade union leaders and activists. The researchers also held a Round Table of trade unionists, journalists and employers in Belgrade in September 2008, funded by the British Academy. Findings: The paper concludes that wild capitalism is an integral, rather than deviant mode of behaviour in Serbia. Originality/value: The findings have relevance for other post Communist states, which may be subject to a greater or lesser degree to political clientelism and fragmentation of employment relations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Capitalism; Corporate governance; Serbia",

We find that Chinese respondents can, overall, make appropriate ethical judgments on explicitly unethical business behaviors but they may still adopt a relatively tolerant view towards some business behaviors that are less explicit in deviation from the general business ethics. Regarding the ethical assessment of the use of OBAs in practice, Chinese respondents can generally recognize the illegitimacy and irrationality of the OBAs and they hold reservations on the so-called positive effects of OBAs. In addition, the paper has further analyzed the impacts of a series of influential factors (e.g., gender, age, education, job occupation, work experience, firm size/listing status, and business ownership) on the ethical judgments of general business ethical issues and the ethical assessment of the nature of OBAs made by the respondents respectively. © 2011.","Business ethics; Ethical judgment; Moral choice; Off-book accounts; People's Republic of China",

The political and strategic reasons as well as internal motivation for SMEs to incorporate CSR into their business strategies are discussed with support from relevant literature. Furthermore, we offer a discussion on the characteristics of different approaches to incorporating CSR as part of business strategy and provide examples from the Norwegian context. As part of this discussion, we look into some of the clusters in Europe which have adopted a systematic approach to implement CSR as part of their agenda. We propose a means to undertake CSR as part of the cluster through a network model to address the limitations faced by the SMEs when they try to implement CSR individually. A network model (cluster approach) to CSR will motivate the uptake of CSR among SMEs when the network (cluster) is characterized by close geographical proximity and operates in the same sector. The uptake of CSR as part of the network (cluster) agenda can also lead to innovation through cooperation and competition. The particular challenges faced by the SMEs in implementing and sustaining CSR can be also minimized by being part of a network (cluster). © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","cluster; corporate social responsibility; ISO 26000; network model; participatory approach; SMEs; strategy",

While the current business curriculum typically educates students in the key business disciplines, many business schools deliver their curriculum by creating courses based on functional area, rather than the integration of knowledge from a holistic perspective. Therefore, the purpose of this literature review is to explore several approaches for delivering the business curriculum Design/methodology/approach: This aim is achieved through a holistic approach, which highlights the benefits and limitations of each proposal. Key approaches include capstone projects, service learning projects, team teaching, and integrative case studies. Findings: The literature review revealed that all four approaches provide students with the opportunity to integrate their business knowledge with the critical skills that they have mastered in their liberal arts courses. However, of these approaches, the research suggests that implementing a service learning program not only permits students to integrate their knowledge, but also provides the opportunity for real-life application of these concepts. In addition, this approach also provides the opportunity for students to experience social responsibility through civic engagement, hopefully strengthening their sense of ethics and character. Originality/value: The role of modern business is not only to maintain profits for its shareholders, but also to demonstrate good corporate citizenship. Thus, today's business educators have the responsibility to prepare students for the role of modern business, including corporate citizenship, sustainability, and social responsibility. Thus, this paper will allow business educators to explore ways to achieve this goal. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business development; Business studies; Curriculum development; Education; Teaching",

It suggests that policy developments in the area of knowledge resource management, measurement and reporting should include these important elements that receive only limited attention within contemporary international IC frameworks. The main implications of this paper are that current contemporary IC frameworks are limited and that to overcome these limitations an engagement with relevant aspects of the literature pertaining to strategy, performance measurement and management of IC is necessary.

First, it aims to discuss some measures managers would take on the basis of an empirical case study - Dell's pricing mistakes on the web site - and find out the underlying motivation regarding consumers' attitude toward Dell. Second, there appears to be a fruitful opportunity to explore whether consumers' requests or different degrees of compensation will have any impact on organizational reputation (intangible assets). Design/methodology/approach: The survey investigates consumers' attitude toward the Dell crisis case, including how and why it affected the reputation of the company. The main questionnaire survey was conducted after the Dell pricing mistakes. In total, 433 samples were found valid and kept for further examination. The study tests the proposed hypotheses by structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: By taking Dell's pricing mistake on the web site as an example, the study finds that managers sometimes opt for solutions unfavorable to the whole organization, in order to ensure self interest, including over quota coupons to reimburse consumers, which would be harmful to other stakeholders. Managers face not only consumers' interests but also other stakeholders' as well as corporate intangible assets. Also, consumers have different backgrounds and these characteristics will exercise influence on perceived crisis management. Originality/value: Although the academic literature has given much attention to the internet issues or crisis management, little attention seems to have been paid to the crisis potential coming from the internet. The power of consumers may hugely increase in the internet age and make the crisis graver, because the internet changes the ability of external commentators to make their opinions widely known, and hurts the reputation of corporations more deeply. A major theoretical contribution of this study is comprehension and filling the gaps in the existing literature.

In the spirit of atomistic, unrestrained competition, retailers were free to set prices without undue interference from upstream channel participants. Attempts by manufacturers or other channel participants to restrict retail price setting initiatives were viewed by regulators as an unwarranted and illegal interference with the market mechanism. Restrictions on price setting initiatives would, it was argued, lessen competition and ultimately raise prices above competitive levels to the detriment of consumers. Recently, under the leadership of newly appointed Chief Justice Roberts, a more ""business friendly"" Supreme Court has reversed this policy; vertical price fixing is no longer a per se violation of U.S. antitrust law. By a five-to-four margin, the Court held in Leegin Creative Leather Products that manufacturers could, under certain circumstances, establish binding retail selling prices. Henceforth, retail price setting restrictions will be subject to a rule of reason evaluation whereby price restrictions will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Proponents of the now-legal restrictions argue that this will ensure that merchandise sold through retail outlets will receive needed support, free riding will be reduced or eliminated, and new brand introduction will be facilitated. Critics argue that the Court's decision marks a return to the days of fair trading; marginal firms will be protected, so-called ""inframarginal consumers"" will be forced to pay for services they do not want or need, and prices for many branded products will rise, all to the detriment of consumer welfare. © 2011 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

These crises (new technology bubbles, the sub-prime crisis ...) have led economists and financial analysts to the following conclusions. First of all, systemic risk has increased during the last 30 years, which had led regulators to devise rules to evaluate information more efficiently. Second, the recent collapse of stock markets despite the national rescue measures shows the importance of preventative procedures. The third point is that aggressive capitalism has demonstrated its limits. The aim of this paper is to show that regulation is a necessary but not sufficient condition to ensure the efficiency of banking institutions, financial markets and the management of companies. Design/methodology/approach: Through the analysis of the Swiss banking sector, the paper provides an insight for banks to satisfy social pressure on more ethical behavior. This case could be an example for another functioning for financial institutions. Findings: By refocusing on their core business, banking institutions will be capable of realizing profit and creating value for the community. Practical implications: The arguments discussed in this paper could be of interest both for professionals and academics willing to solve the antagonism between profit and ethics: profit can be compatible with social value added.

Ethics Position Theory (EPT) maintains that individuals' personal moral philosophies influence their ethical judgments, actions, and emotions. The theory, when describing individual differences in moral philosophies, stresses two dimensions: relativism (skepticism with regards to inviolate moral principles) and idealism (concern for positive outcomes). Extending previous research that identified differences in relativism and idealism between residents of different countries and world regions, we examined the relationship between relativism, idealism, and the regulatory standards governing commercial activities of firms headquartered in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. The results indicated that the level of relativism of a nation's populace predicted degree of ethical codification of commerce in that nation. These findings suggest that the ethical conduct of business will be more closely regulated in countries where relativism is low (e.g., Australia, Canada) but less closely regulated in countries where the residents are more ethically relativistic (e.g., Hong Kong, Spain). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Business ethics; Cross-cultural values; Ethics codes; Ethics position",

We proved that, even though some European countries have made an effort to provide safer ICT services, all stakeholders still need to cooperate and agree on solutions to the commercial problems associated with children using mobile phones. This can be done by signing codes of conduct. We found that even though some companies implement measures to protect children from accessing harmful content via their mobile phones, they do so for reasons of legal and not social responsibility. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Child safety and privacy; Mobile phone companies; Self-regulation; Spain","article; business ethics; child; commercial phenomena; comparative study; human; industry; information processing; legal aspect; medical ethics; mobile phone; multivariate analysis; organization; safety; social behavior; Spain; Cellular Phone; Child; Codes of Ethics; Commerce; Data Collection; Ethics, Business; Humans; Industry; Multivariate Analysis; Organizations; Safety; Social Responsibility; Spain"

Existing theories, addressing the corporate level of analysis, focus on forces exogenous to the firm: local resource pressures, and institutional norms. Using a combination of induction and fuzzy-set analysis, I draw on documentary evidence and 298 interviews with managers and stakeholders to build theory about the conditions that shape subsidiaries' stakeholder orientations. Two major findings emerge. First, although theory emphasizes external stakeholders' control over resources, internal control through the corporate parent can crowd out the voices of local stakeholders. Second, although institutional theory proposes isomorphism with local norms and standards, some corporations are subject to scrutiny by global stakeholders, and their subsidiaries face higher requirements for social engagement than their peers. These findings are the foundation of a mid-range theory that combines conventional explanations, focused on environmental factors, and an internal-stakeholder perspective, based around the roles of the parent corporation as owner and resource provider, to predict stakeholder orientation. © 2011 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.","corporate social responsibility; fuzzy set methods; global stakeholders",

The first inclination may be stronger, but the second also matters. Equity theory, too, posits that in personal, social, and societal relationships, two concerns stand out: first, how much reward does a person reap from a given social relationship? Second, how fair and equitable is that relationship? According to equity theory, people feel most comfortable when their relationships are maximally profitable and they are giving and getting exactly what they deserve from their relationships-no more and certainly no less. In this review, we will begin by describing the classic equity paradigm and the supporting research. We will then review the history of equity research. In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars generally concentrated on testing Equity Theorys applicability to romantic, social, and business relationships. More recently, scholars have attempted to speculate about why people in almost all societies share a concern with social justice and equity. We close by predicting that the next stage in equity and social justice research, scholars will explore (1) who is to be included in the moral community, (2) a commentary on the current political debate as to the ideal balance between personal interest and social justice, and (3) how governments, business, and social activists can best foster that ideal. © 2011 Association of Management, Spirituality & Religion.","Equity; Social justice; Spirituality",

The paper also seeks to compare wasta with networking and mentoring. Design/methodology/approach: The argument is based on relevant literature, the authors' own knowledge through conducting research in the Arab world, informal interviews and survey data conducted across the Middle Eastern Region. Findings: The research clearly shows that on balance wasta remains traditional in its influence in the career advancement of individuals and business life and social life and is unlikely to diminish in the near future, despite the perception that it is an unfair practice. Wasta also displays similarities and differences with networking and mentoring. Research implications/limitations: Fundamental knowledge on wasta is limited precluding reliable conclusions on how wasta compares with networking and mentoring. Further research needs to be conducted with a larger sample, across a range of industries. Practical implications: The paper suggests the need for human resource departments of Middle Eastern organizations to create conditions that encourage managers to develop social relationships given the lack of interactive support mechanisms. Originality/value: Given the token status of systematic management studies in the Arab world, this research is important as it extends knowledge in wasta practices in the region, and also in comparing wasta with networking and mentoring. Overall, the paper argues that wasta is a lucrative area for future research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Career development; Cross-cultural studies; Interpersonal relations; Mentoring; Middle East; Networking",

Design/methodology/approach The research was focused on three main areas, namely: relation of CSR programs with the companies' core businesses; coverage of the programs on triple bottom line (economic, social, and environmental); and the execution of CSR programs as sustainable development and the companies' competitive advantage. It used a qualitative approach, i.e. a case study. Primary and secondary data are in the form of information about CSR programs conducted by the four companies from sustainable reports downloaded from each respective company's web site, mass media news downloaded from the internet, and other literature studies. Findings The case study shows high commitment from the four companies to the execution of CSR programs and business ethics. They also attempt to carry out programs involving the triple bottom line. Also, this case study found that two consumer goods companies (Unilever Indonesia and Sari Husada) and one manufacturing company (Astra International) conduct CSR programs that are both related and unrelated to their core businesses while a mining company (Aneka Tambang) tends to conduct CSR programs that are unrelated to its core business. Another finding from this case study is that both related and unrelated programs are forms of the companies' sustainable development. Research limitations/implications The primary data in this case study were only collected from the publications of CSR programs, and from company web sites or news coverage accessed via the internet, and so may be incomplete and not detailed. Therefore, it would be better to include in-depth interviews with the companies to support the primary data in a further study. In general, this research brings a specific understanding of the qualitative research method. In particular, it gives a greater understanding of the importance of all applications in a case study. The procedures, types, designs and data analysis methods in the study case can be comprehended clearly. Originality/value The results of this case study can improve comprehension of the CSR concepts and theories, business ethics, sustainable development and reputations used to identify the pattern of CSR programs implemented by the four companies as research objects. Last but not least, the results of the case study give detailed comprehension regarding the CSR practices of several companies in Indonesia, based on the companies' characteristics, CSR programs' relations to the core business, CSR programs covering the triple bottom line, and the sustainability of the CSR programs. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Design/methodology/approach The method used is qualitative research with a case study approach. The empirical data are based on the fieldwork in the states of Esprito Santo and Bahia. The aim was to scrutinize the corporate tactics in gaining societal legitimacy, both in Brazil and in Finland; these were categorized into thematic groups. Findings The legitimacy of the Finnish companies becomes questionable due to the unethical tactics of their Brazilian business partner, Aracruz Celulose SA. When the company takes its ""marginal"" stakeholders' demands seriously and commits itself to them in diverse ways (economically, ecologically etc.), corporate social responsibility becomes a reality. The search for legitimacy also requires the company to change its corporate knowledge production systems, and also requires a willingness on the part of the company to encounter different types of knowledge that are locally attached. Originality/value The study offers new information about the relationship between multinational corporations and local communities in Brazil especially from the perspective of indigenous communities. The paper also contributes to legitimation research.

Its purpose is to evaluate critically the genuineness of the early stages in acquiring CSR practices, and to advance the notion of authenticity in its mature development stage. The analyses seek to show an imbalance between the so-called feminine and masculine principles in the professional business arena, which prevents an authentic CSR business approach taking place. Design/methodology/approach The authors approach the topic from various concepts and criteria of moral correctness regarding CSR, and crucial change points in the transient process from insincere to authentic CSR. Findings The paper identifies some elements of insincere CSR in every company in its early stages of acquiring CSR practices, especially in the early stages of the development of the business culture, and also during the maturing process. Research limitations/implications The paper demonstrates the excessive significance of the rapid development of CSR sensibility in society and in the business community because, in such situations, knowledge of all affected parties prevents business subjects from misdirection and forces them to choose between lying and telling the truth. Practical implications The paper demonstrates a business-based rationale for the adoption of mature, non-deceptive CSR practices, since the overall situation in the business community and in society becomes clearer regarding criteria.

Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts a case study approach to investigate a business that operates successfully in this challenging market. Findings As a consequence of increasing demand for ethical clothing, it has become standard practice for UK clothing retailers to develop CSR policies which impact upon their methods of garment sourcing and partnerships with suppliers. There is also a significant trend for retailers to offer ethical clothing ranges made from organic cotton or produced by Fair Trade manufacturers. The paper includes a case study on People Tree, which sells Fair Trade clothing sourced from developing countries. People Tree is rare amongst clothing companies in that it provides customers with a transparent view of its production sources via the internet. The company provides an example of how socially responsible and environmentally sustainable global sourcing can be applied in practice. Research limitations/implications The study focuses on aspects of sustainability in an individual retailer. This could be extended to other ethical retailers in different countries, and a longitudinal study of such companies could be conducted.

Those involved in the Camisea project succeeded in creating an open approach to building stakeholder relationships, allowing them to navigate through a number of diverse and challenging socio-political and ecological issues. An integral part of Shell's approach was acting upon its commitment to high standards of operation and values.

Business ethics pays close attention to the international character of business. The key question is whether or not there is any common set of values shared by all people of all cultural and historical backgrounds. Western multinationals are in practice unable to prevent shoddy labour practices in their overseas factories. The discrepancy between ""the-what-is"" and ""the-what-should-be"" is probably the main problem in the field of ethics. With this in mind, we have been teaching Business Ethics at the Faculty of Informatics and Management for more than 10 years. The method of teaching which proves to be the most suitable is based on studying and discussing case studies. Students are taught how to approach these problems and that the pursuit of profit should always be ethical. Teaching ethics at FIM UHK is based on basic anthropina, i.e. basic human characteristics, which differentiate humans from other living creatures, as well as on the European philosophical tradition and also on pre-philosophical, non-philosophical as well as non-European philosophical foundations of ethics. We ground our course in traditional ethical concepts and problems (e.g. the origin, essence and function of morality, relations between morality and law, reason and emotion in decision-making and acting, individualism and universalism, subjectivism and objectivism as well as transversalism) and concentrate on the discussed problems of contemporary ethics - mainly business ethics. We respect multi-level ethical analysis covering the universal - global dimension, the dimension of socio-cultural changes in current heterogeneous societies, professional and institutional dimension as well as company codes of conduct, and the dimension of individual morality.","Business; Education; Enterprise; Ethics; Manager",

It has been argued that scientific uncertainties surrounding nanotechnologies and the inability of regulatory agencies to keep up with industry developments mean that voluntary regulation will play a part in the development of nanotechnologies. The development of technological applications based on nanoscale science is now increasingly seen as a potential test case for new models of regulation based on future-oriented responsibility, lifecycle risk management, and upstream public engagement. This article outlines findings from a project undertaken in 2008-2009 for the UK Government's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) by BRASS at Cardiff University, involving an in-depth survey both of current corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting in the UK nanotechnologies industry, and of attitudes to particular stakeholder issues within the industry. The article analyses the results to give an account of the nature of corporate social performance (CSP) within the industry, together with the particular model of CSR operating therein ('do no harm' versus 'positive social force').

Regardless of whether these criticisms are well founded or not, the question arises how accounting-related techniques for supporting managerial decision-making differ in shareholder and stakeholder value management. Accounting information can affect managerial decision-making in two ways: directly as input to decisions or indirectly by influencing the behavior of managers. This article reviews the contributions and limitations of information that prominent accounting-related techniques of shareholder management and stakeholder management provide for managerial decision-making. In a comparative perspective we find that the approaches in shareholder value management are much more advanced. In particular the two roles of information in shareholder value management are manifest in accounting-related techniques which are focused on increasing firm value. The value driver models or residual income-based performance measures may serve as examples. In comparison, accounting-related techniques to support managerial decision-making in stakeholder management are not as well advanced. So far we have approaches which concentrate on selective stakeholder groups and only partially address the multi-dimensionality of stakeholder value creation. From a conceptual perspective our findings indicate that stakeholder value creation requires a more integrated approach for answering the question whether stakeholder value is created or diminished. As a consequence, if stakeholder-orientation is taken seriously, the time has come to pay more attention to related accounting techniques. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Business ethics; Decision-making; Firm value; Multi-criteria decision-making; Stakeholder-value; Value based management",

In this paper I argue that, despite this attention, the fact that it is a genuinely pluralistic theory, in the tradition of pluralistic theories of political philosophy, is often overlooked. It is in the notion of moral free space that this pluralism is most clearly expressed. This oversight is unfortunate for two reasons. Firstly, it prevents the potential of ISCT, as a normative theory of business ethics, from being appreciated fully; secondly, it leads us to ignore resources that could help tackle its most problematic flaws. In this second respect, I show how some of these flaws could be addressed by paying closer attention to the similarities between ISCT and John Rawls' theory of Political Liberalism. © 2011 The Author.",,

Moreover, the association between stakeholder management and management control system use is analyzed. In the wake of the economic crisis of 2008/2009, many firms were faced with severe threats that called for immediate short-term action to ensure firm survival. However, short-term action like massive cost-cutting and cash generation often are blamed for going at the expense of long-term health as key stakeholder relations may be irreversibly harmed. Hence, three interrelated questions are addressed theoretically and empirically: First, we analyze the impact of the recent economic crisis on firms' control strategies. More specifically, we investigate whether a high crisis impact on firms is associated with a shortening of reporting cycles, a more interactive use of control-relevant information, restriction of employee autonomy and a focus on liquidity and cost-cutting. Second, we examine from the viewpoint of stakeholder theory how firms can make use of active stakeholder management for crisis management. Third, we explore whether firms can take short-term measures for ensuring liquidity and cutting costs and at the same time pursue a stakeholder strategy aiming at the long-term survival of the firm. Using survey data from 204 major Austrian corporations, we provide evidence that firms significantly adjusted their control systems as a response to the economic crisis. Our data do not indicate an immanent contradiction between a ""short-term finance focus"" and the pursuit of a sustainable stakeholder strategy. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Crisis; Management accounting; Management control; Stakeholder management",

A responsible corporation embraces the principle of transparency of data pertaining to its performance and its policies and strives for strategies that enhance its sustainability. A model is presented that uses hierarchical fuzzy reasoning to assess corporate sustainability, given a number of inputs, called basic indicators.

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a qualitative case study approach utilizing an extensive interview as the method for data collection. A series of structured questions specifically designed to focus the interview on the topic of interest was used to facilitate data collection. Findings: The paper presents insights from Mr William C. Peeper, the person largely responsible for building the Orlando Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau from a two-person organization into the multi million-dollar operation it became by the time he retired 25 years later. Since the focus of the paper is on how to successfully balance the differing goals of stakeholders to achieve organizational goals, this interview offers a number of lessons learned that can be used by any organizational leader seeking to balance the interests of diverse stakeholders. Originality/value: This study provides fresh ideas and new insights into how to successfully manage an organization's stakeholders in ways that make it possible to achieve an organization's mission across time. The success Mr Peeper had in gaining sustained support for the mission and goals of the Orlando CVB provides important lessons on how to manage all stakeholders especially the corporate governance structure that is pertinent to any organization that has to accommodate many diverse viewpoints and interests. There is little existing knowledge on managing stakeholders across time as their interests and needs change and the management of them must also adapt. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CVB; Destination management; Destination marketing; History; Organizational governance; Orlando; Stakeholders; United States of America",

We investigated the stakeholder interaction effects on performance of domestic firms competing in an emerging market (Wright, Filatotchev, Hoskisson, & Peng, 2005) from a contractual perspective (Williamson, 1985). We argue that interacting stakeholders in a contractual set yield synergistic governance structures that allow firms more efficient access to external resources. Using a sample of 267 firms in Brazil (secondary data), we explored different patterns in stakeholder contracting with community, government, top management, and employees. A three-stage analysis process was devised: cluster analysis, general linear model estimation and verification tests. Results suggest that stakeholder interaction has a positive impact on firm performance.

The reference point is Colombiás 1991 Constitution and the position is that the liberal model of enterprise does not satisfy the principles and norms of a social state of law. The defence of this thesis makes a reconstruction of the central elements of the model based on critical readings of Friedman, Posner, Kalmanovitz, Carrasquilla and Clavijo.

What is the relationship between social justice and justice at work? How should we conceive of the problem of justice in the economic sphere? And, what is justice in the workplace? To see fully what demands justice makes on the workplace, we should first spell out the implications that domestic justice has for working conditions. When this is done, we can develop a conception of workplace justice and investigate what content such local justice should have. John Rawls's political liberalism was constructed for the specific problem of a just basic structure; in order to apply it to another problem the key theoretical concepts must be revised.

I will argue that this nomer is important for two main reasons. First, the corporate form distinguishes itself from any other form of business representation. In this sense, it is important to know exactly how this form is different to understand how conceptions of 'corporate governance' relate to different forms of representation. Second, it is my contention that the use of a particular understanding of incorporation directly informs the concept of internal governance in terms of constituency, structure, ownership and the locus of corporate agency. It is in this sense that I argue that the identification of corporate constituencies and the allocation of agency and ownership is a precondition of business ethics. With this aim in mind, I explore the governance in corporations as the result of the legal understanding of incorporation and the separate legal entity. I explore two historical positions from which five legal positions on the separate legal entity can be derived. These five positions provide reference points for the attribution of ownership and agency between the separate legal entity and the aggregation of individuals that together make up the corporation. Incorporation, as the legal act that constitutes the corporation, can then be shown to adopt multiple and mutually exclusive positions. These positions are central to the debate on the respective claims to agency and ownership between the separate legal entity and the aggregation of individuals. I then end the article by arguing that all concepts of incorporation create legal and economic issues regarding the allocation of ownership and agency, which makes their understanding and the choice behind them important for theories of governance. © 2011 The Author.",,

The paper aims to obtain empirical evidence regarding the importance of relational aspects (trust) vis-à-vis organisational ones (reliance) for building long-term business relationships. Design/methodology/approach: This is an exploratory study to examine trust and reliance in the manufacturing and construction industries of four countries: UK, India, Pakistan, and Poland. Statistical analysis is based on a data sample of 501 responses collected through a survey of buying and selling relationships. Findings: Although varying across countries, stable relationships with high levels of both trust and reliance exist widely in business markets. Exclusively trust-based business relationships, i.e. those which are mainly driven by individual-level aspects, are very rare. However, both trust and reliance are significant for building relationships with long-term perspectives. Practical implications: Managers in firms who want to build advantageous and sustainable business relationships need to be able to discern the difference between trust in people on the one hand, and reliance on the partner firms on the other. This research shows that to maintain sustainable relationships, firms should not only focus their relational capabilities on enhancing reliance aspects with their business partners, but also aim to build good levels of trust in the interaction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business relationships; International business; Reliance; Trust",

In this paper, we aim to address this gap by critically engaging with marketing campaigns of so-called 'ethical' bottled water. We especially focus on a major CSR strategy of a range of different companies that promise to provide drinking water for (what they name as) 'poor African people' by way of Western consumers purchasing bottled water. Following Fairclough's approach, we unfold a three-step critical discourse analysis of the marketing campaigns of 10 such 'ethical' brands. Our results show that bottled water companies try to influence consumers' tastes through the management of the cultural meaning of bottled water, producing a more 'ethical' and 'socially responsible' perception of their products/ brands. Theoretically, we base our analysis on McCracken's model of the cultural meaning of consumer goods, which, we argue, offers a critical perspective of the recent emergence of CSR and business ethics initiatives. We discuss how these marketing campaigns can be framed as historical struggles associated with neo-liberal ideology and hegemony. Our analysis demonstrates how such CSR strategies are part of a general process of the reproduction of capitalist modes of accumulation and legitimation through the usage of cultural categories. © 2011 The Author.",,

Previous consumer research has tended to focus on goods and services within daydreams and fantasies so that goods seem to be central to, and key resources in, the construction of imagined scenarios. Here we argue that this methodological framing has restricted a broader understanding of the imagination and the contextualization of consumption within it. By analysing phenomenological accounts that placed imagining ahead of consumption as the focus of the study, we found that individuals readily envisioned common cultural desires for successful relationships, happiness and love in positive imagined futures, where goods may be merely assumed as part of the background, or dismissed in favour of preferred emotional experiences. As such this article uses Law's (2004) conceptions of presence, manifest absence and othering to provide a more nuanced analysis of how and where consumption may be seen in the imagination. In this way we suggest that previous narratives of the consumer imagination have neglected individuals' autonomy in both removing consumer practices and positioning social relationships as more prominent. © 2011 The Author(s).","daydream; escape; everyday life; future imagining; othering; relationships",

Notions of competition, influence strategies, change in stakeholder networks, mindsets, salience or values, learning, creative destruction, long-term sustainability, stakeholder reciprocity, sustainable development, and value creation all embed change and thus time dynamics. Static complexity and heterogeneity across units-of-analysis are not the same as dynamics but do also change over time.

The article presents an argument that the stakeholder salience model as a tool for analyzing stakeholder relationships is not sufficient for understanding business value creation. In the recent stakeholder literature, understanding business value creation has become an important theme. Through an analysis of an empirical case, the article shows how the three stakeholder relationship attributes, legitimacy, power and urgency help to reveal the definitive stakeholders and to capture dynamics of stakeholder relations. However, in the case of strategic change, where the value creation of a firm is in transition, a more profound understanding of stakeholder relationships is needed. As a result of our empirical analysis, six characteristics of stakeholder relationships were identified. To conclude, the question of who and what really counts should be replaced by the question of how value is created in stakeholder relationships. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Salience model; Stakeholder relationship; Value creation",

While many studies provide descriptions of a firm's CRS motivations both within and across sectors, there is a need to bring this literature together in a way that addresses, in a systematic way, the interaction of these influences at the level of the firm (Lynes, Andracuk, 2008). Though during decades numerous aspects of CRS have been the subject of the investigation in both academic and business studies. Apparently, this implicates a shift from the pure shareholder perspective of maximizing profits and corporate value towards a broader concept that encompasses multiple stakeholder concerns and values and, thus, involves various conflicting goals and objectives (Hediger, 2010). Neither the motives tools of an enterprise to operate in the manner are clear despite the fact that it is essential that business leaders assume responsibility in order to ensure the continuance of economic order and its sane evolution (Spector, 2008). Conceptually substantiated interaction between the corporate social responsibility and enterprise, high lightening motives through which the stakeholders are able makes it wealthy. Firms engage in CSR activities as a way to enhance their reputation, pre-empt legal sanction, respond to NGO action, and manage their risk and to generate customer loyalty. CSR can potentially decrease production inefficiencies, reduce cost and risk and at the same time allow companies to increase sales, increase access to capital, new markets, and brand recognition (Cruz & Wakolbinger, 2008). The analysis of scientific research has shown that academics are not scare in proposing insights helping describe the motivations for corporate social responsibility at the level of the enterprise, however, a generalizing view is still scare. This standpoint has a logical position: the construction of model helping to understand the construction of public relation and explain the potential influence in the process of CRS implementation and the role of stakeholders in it is needed. The constructed methodological framework could be useful continuing academic discussion on the topic. The findings of the article seek to influence public attitudes stressing the effect of corporate social responsibility. Basing on the article, public and industry as well as a social leader might determine essential strategic elements allowing achieving the mentioned objectives in the most efficient way. The logical structure of the article was determined by the aim and the objectives of the scientific research solution sequence which is reflected in three parts. In the Introduction the topic relevance, scientific problem and level of its analysis, object, the aim, and tasks of the scientific research were presented.

The second part of the article is dedicated to the analysis of corporate social responsibility (CRS) in the market of virtue. The third part deals with - to the recognition of stakeholder values and pressure as well as the presentation of stakeholders' role in pursuit of CRS. This standpoint has a logical position: it can be constructed as a model helping to understand the construction of public relation and explains the potential influence in the process of CRS implementation and the role of stakeholders in it.

It seeks to focus on how to measure both business and community benefits derived from CCI, especially stressing the need for developing indicators beyond the input level considering outputs and impacts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper follows a case study research strategy in a subsidiary of a multinational chemical and pharmaceutical company. Data collection is based on triangulation of data using interviews, action research, and documents. Findings: Based on the case study presented, it was found that, when CCI is an integral part of corporate strategy, it is also possible to develop advanced performance measurement systems for CCI. Such measurement systems include input, output, and impact level metrics for both community and business benefits. Community benefits are best developed and monitored in collaboration with the NGO partner. Further, it was found that the measuring frequency partly transcends conventional reporting periods. Practical implications: The research should motivate companies that engage in corporate community involvement to go beyond input-level metrics in measuring the success of such initiatives. However, in order to successfully operate a performance monitoring on output and impact levels, partnering with an NGO that has greater capability in socio-economic assessments is key. Originality/value: This paper shows how NGOs can contribute to performance measurement as part of the strategic performance management system of a corporation and how this allows for metrics beyond common input-level to address output or even impact-level metrics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Balanced scorecard; Corporate community involvement; Corporate social responsibility; Non-governmental organizations; Performance measurement systems; Pharmaceuticals industry",

An equilibrium in these three markets yields a three-equation structural model that relates corporate financial performance (CFP), corporate social performance (CSP), and social pressure. This paper estimates the simultaneous equation model for a panel of over 1,600 firms and finds that CFP is uncorrelated with CSP and negatively correlated with social pressure. CSP is decreasing in CFP and increasing in social pressure. Social pressure is increasing in CSP and decreasing in CFP, which is consistent with social pressure being directed to soft targets. Disaggregating the panel indicates that CFP is positively correlated with CSP for firms in consumer markets and negatively correlated for industrial markets. For consumer markets, CSP is increasing in CFP, which is consistent with a perquisites hypothesis that managers spend on CSR when they can afford it. For industrial markets CSP is decreasing in CFP, which is consistent with a moral management hypothesis. For both consumer and industrial markets, CSP is responsive to social pressure. © 2011 Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved.","corporate social performance; markets; politics",

Based on the results obtained, it proposes to draw implications for emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach: Combining content analysis of CSR reports and corporate social performance data, the paper built a longitudinal dataset starting from the population of worldwide companies included in the AccountAbility Rating between 2004 and 2007. Longitudinal regression analysis is performed on a final sample size of 114 firm-year observations involving 38 firms over a three-year period. Findings: The paper finds evidence that the level of disclosure does not improve firm ability to manage stakeholders. However, a finer-grained analysis of the structure of disclosure shows that better social performers are those who increased the breadth of their disclosure to stakeholders and uniformly distributed disclosure across stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: Results provide an empirical test for the theories describing true responsible economic actors as those who are able to combine high engagement with the social context of reference and balanced coverage of diversified interests. However, the study suffers the usual limitations of content analysis-based research, as well as exclusively relying on CSR disclosure by large corporations. Practical implications: Findings suggest not only the importance of structuring the report in a comprehensive way, and extending coverage to multiple stakeholders and related issues, but also the need for balance between informative needs, thus avoiding concentrated structures. Accordingly, companies that report on more themes, presenting a balanced and comprehensive product, develop a better ability to manage their stakeholder network, thus gaining higher corporate social performance. Originality/value: The study seeks to revisit the relation between CSR disclosure and corporate social performance, answering the request for more rigorous measures. It goes beyond the level of disclosure as a comprehensive proxy of firm-stakeholder dialogue and demonstrates how a finer-grained analysis of the structure of disclosure can be a better predictor of superior performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; CSR disclosure and reporting; Emerging markets; Social responsibility",

Design/methodology/approach - By drawing on existing CSR literature the achievements and gaps of CSR are demonstrated. The literature review focuses on a small selection of important CSR models, referencing the most iconic from the last few decades. Findings - Existing CSR models are critiqued as being insufficient in providing an adequate understanding of CSR. It is asserted that a more efficient model of CSR is required and a new model of CSR is proposed, which is more relevant to and reflective of the present day business environment. The model of ""consumer-driven corporate responsibility"" (CDCR) is founded on the notion that consumer demand for CSR is both the most likely and the most effective driver for the implementation of CSR in a company. Research limitations/implications - As CSR is rapidly evolving, undoubtedly models will be created after this paper was written, that, for this reason, are out of the scope of this review. Practical implications - This paper provides an alternative, more comprehensive and more effective model of CSR, useful as a tool for academics and business leaders alike. Originality/value - As the model of CDCR focuses on the conditions under which companies are most likely to adopt CSR from both a descriptive and normative perspective, it is proposed as being a more suitable approach to CSR.

Findings - Finnish students have a stronger belief that reporting is reliable and open than their US counterparts. Finnish students show more positive views on the way forest industry companies implement environmental responsibility than their US counterparts. US students show more positive views on social responsibility, especially those connected with stakeholder relations, than their Finnish counterparts. Originality/value - The obvious connections between reporting views and perceptions of corporate responsibility highlight the significance of reliable reporting in the context of CR. Major fields of study significantly affected student perceptions of CR. The results of the study can help schools and enterprises to design proper CR-related education courses or programs. Results of this study indicate that the CR weakness of the industry still lies in environmental responsibility.

At present, the level and quality of CR reports in Indonesia are relatively low, due to ineffective support infrastructures. To date, there has been no generally accepted CR reporting standard that can be used to guide companies preparing CR reports. Moreover, an external assurance service is advisable to ensure the credibility of CR reports, yet assurance standards are still relatively undeveloped. To support the implementation of a company's CR, a CR committee may be warranted, or a functional expansion of an existing committee, such as audit committee. Indonesia's Corporation Law obliges companies to report their social and environmental activities in their annual reports, but as there is no regulation following up this obligation, a variety of reports are submitted by companies, complicating evaluation.

It is intended to make clear the phenomena about the relationship between audit risk (AR), implementation of business ethics principles (IBEP) and corporate governance risk (CGR). Design/methodology/approach - The method used was hypothesis testing. Unit of analysis was individual (i.e. Indonesian CPA), and the gathering of data was cross-sectional. The sample was determined by purposive sampling. Data were collected using questionnaires, and data analysis was conducted by structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings - According to Indonesian CPAs' perception, the AR is affected by the client's CGR, whereas the client's IBEP does not affect AR, but clients' CGR and IBEP both significantly affect AR. It is suggested: first, that the next researcher should study audit risk related to business ethics. Second, that the management should strengthen the implementation of business ethics in running a business; and finally that the Bapepam (Capital Market Oversight Board) should oversee both public company and public accountant in the implementation of governance. Research limitations/implications - This research noted some implications, including: nature and intensity of gathering data, restricted respondent (CPA-CMAF), and restricted variables of corporate governance (BoD, and Audit Committee). Originality/value - This research suggests the necessity to modify ARM by dividing inherent risk into errors risk and fraud risk as bases for accumulating audit evidence.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the mediation effect of strategic alliance with stakeholders on the relationship between dynamic capabilities and sustainable competitive advantage in China, an emerging market, to give suggestions on how to manage corporate responsibility to address a rapidly changing environment. Design/methodology/approach: The paper tested its hypotheses on a sample in the context of China. Specifically, 700 questionnaires were sent out; 300 were collected, of which 227 were usable. The partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling approach was used to analyze the data and test the hypotheses. Findings: The paper has incorporated dynamic capabilities view and corporate responsibility perspective to explain the effects of strategic alliance with different stakeholders to sustainability in emerging markets. The empirical results show that opportunity-sensing capability, reconfiguration capability and technological flexibility capability have significant impacts on sustainable competitive advantage. Additionally, the finding indicates that the effect of opportunity-sensing capability on sustainable competitive advantage is fully mediated by strategic alliance with stakeholders. Moreover, the result indicates that the influence of reconfiguration capability on sustainable competitive advantage is partially mediated by strategic alliance with stakeholders. The result indicates that the influence of technological flexibility capability on sustainable competitive advantage is partially mediated by strategic alliance with stakeholders too. Originality/value: Combining theory and evidence from the study, an empirical verification of the links between dynamic capabilities and sustainable competitive advantage in the context of China's emerging economy was conducted. This theme has not yet been studied in the current literature in corporate responsibility.

Within this scope, the objective is to identify accurately and extensively: CSR practices at the social, economic and environmental levels; the motivations, perceived benefits, existing obstacles; and the types of support and strategies that render possible an explanation of the factors which place the greatest restrictions on SME adoption of CSR practices. Design/methodology/approach - This research was realized through the completion of a questionnaire type inquiry structured around table-based analysis. The questionnaire was sent out to a large sample of SMEs in Portugal. Findings - The main results demonstrate that, while CSR takes on an informal, non-structured character, it has been incorporated into the daily management of such companies. Furthermore, contrary to what happens at large companies, CSR at SMEs is fundamentally internally focused and results from attention to the potential benefits to the business from gains in eco-efficiency, a better social climate or a higher profile in the local community. The emphasis is on the adoption of simple, easily applicable and cheap measures and normally with specific results exemplifying how SME CSR is located on the border between entrepreneurialism and business management and that of business citizenship. Research limitations/implications - It is not possible to extrapolate the data obtained since the study focused only on mainland Portugal. Practical implications - The fact that the study clarifies the strategies and motivations of CSR in SMEs makes possible the development of active policies to promote CSR in the universe of these companies. Originality/value - Because the studies on SME CSR remain rare, this research contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics, motivations and strategies of CSR in the SMEs case.

Some ST firms voluntarily pay substantial fees to their external auditors to conduct interim audits, which are not required by regulations. In this study, we investigate and find that ST firms that pay for voluntary interim audits report greater discretionary accrued earnings, higher non-operating earnings, and higher returns on assets in ensuing annual reports. As a result, these firms are more likely to return to profitability and reduce their delisting risk. Our results, which contribute to the current debate on auditor independence, appear to be consistent with the possibility that ST firms ""buy"" external auditors' cooperation to manipulate earnings when faced with the threat of delisting. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","auditor independence; business ethics; China; delisting; earnings manipulation; special treatment; voluntary interim audit",

Focusing on four commonly known approaches: the ethical, the statist, the liberal, and the stakeholder approach, the paper seeks to investigate the reported drivers and barriers to implementing CSR practices. Design/methodology/approach: The paper surveyed top-level managers of a sample of companies currently engaging in a CSR initiative, representing a variety of industry sectors. Findings: The study finds that the CSR approach that is most favored by Indian firms is the stakeholder approach and that the caring or the moral motive, followed by the strategic or profit motive, are important drivers for Indian firms to pursue CSR. Further, the results indicate that the most significant obstacles to CSR implementation are those related to lack of resources, followed by those related to the complexity and difficulty of implementing CSR. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on the activities of leading Indian firms participating in the UN Global Compact (GC), thereby restricting one's knowledge of CSR practices of non-participants. Future research should expand on this effort either by conducting comparative studies of non-participants to the GC, or by investigating CSR practices of firms engaging in other voluntary initiatives. Originality/value: The majority of studies on CSR are still embedded in the economic and organizational contexts of Europe and the USA.

Findings: The global situation is precarious, characterized by multi-polarity, asymmetrical power threats, and a vacuum in global governance. The trade-based economic development of the BRICs is a positive economic sign but raises implications for sustainability.

Each views the governance problem in terms of inter-functional conflicts between stakeholder groups, such as between investors and managers or managers and employees, and rests on the assumption of an idealized corporate structure characterized by the separation of ownership from management. Our review of corporate governance and stakeholder conflict shows that such functional-based characterization is too simplistic and fails to account for important intra-functional conflict. Through a comparative review that considers managerial, stakeholder and family systems of governance, we demonstrate that, while the modality of conflict varies by system, substantial intra-functional conflict is endemic to each. We integrate the findings of the agency and comparative stakeholder theories of corporate governance to offer an authority-based framework with three different governance structures that offers complementary insights into stakeholder conflicts. Thus, our study highlights the important, but often neglected, intra-stakeholder type of conflict in various organizations and provides a basis for understanding their various manifestations and consequences under the different systems of governance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Governance systems; Shareholder value; Stakeholder salience; Stakeholder theory",

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology employed in the study is to survey the main theoretical approaches for understanding and CG in relation to mature markets and EMs. Findings: The paper makes a small but important contribution to theory building by modifying and expanding the conceptual framework put forward by Weimer, Pape, Gedjlovic, and Shapiro to make a distinction between systems of corporate governance and particularly the ""taxonomy of systems of corporate governance"". This is achieved by identifying an additional set of key variables specifically relevant to EMs as a group of countries.

Thus it is proposed that utilization of solitude positively predicts executive-level authentic ethical leadership action and in turn, ethical decision making perceived fairness and integrity.

Perhaps. However, more often than not, both are treated as, and are perceived by customers to be, little more than public relations tools in the promotion of brand. This perception reflects the reality that companies are struggling with how to operationalize the concepts of social and environmental responsibility, while maintaining a fair return to shareholders. The struggle arises because in this area, real change requires thinking about organizational purpose in ways that challenge deeply rooted values. In fact, it involves instilling and managing a change in the innate organizational culture. As such, this paper will view the operationalization of social environmental performance through the lens of the change management literature. The process by which change occurs, as well the factors which drive or impede green change in particular will serve as the framework for this paper.

The study follows Bushee (Account Rev 73(3):305-333, 1998) in categorising institutions as dedicated or transient. The demand for shares is organised according to three factors: a long-term factor, corporate responsibility; a short-term factor, market liquidity; and a time-independent factor, portfolio theory. The rank and importance of the factors for the different types of institutional investor are analysed. For one of two types of dedicated institution, corporate responsibility is as important as portfolio theory in influencing the demand for shares. For all dedicated institutions, corporate responsibility influences the demand for shares more than market liquidity. For two of the three types of transient institution, market liquidity is the most important factor in share selection. For all transient institutions, the least important factor is corporate responsibility. Findings suggest that corporate responsibility positively and significantly influences the demand for shares by dedicated institutions. The discussion considers the extent to which these trends are constitutive of significant shifts in ethicality within the context of institutional investment. Looking at this from within a highly institutionalised Anglo market model, dedicated institutions' commitment to broader and longer-term concerns could be interpreted as a small but significant step towards a more axiologically informed ethical business practice. Such a form of engagement calls for sensitive attention to a fuller range of features deemed to be relevant to investment decisions, as opposed to more narrow reliance on legislation, codes of practice and fiduciary principles. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","business ethics; corporate responsibility; institutional investment; share ownership",

Characteristically, stakeholder studies of environmental management have concentrated on stakeholder influence or the creation of stakeholder management models. In contrast to those, the present study identifies different types of stakeholder relationships: power-based, collaborative, conflicting, and one-sided. Through descriptions of those relationships, business actors participate in the power to define responsibility, share responsibility among actors, question environmental interest, and justify environmental impacts. The results of the study demonstrate that, when regarding environmental issues in business, instead of analysing single stakeholder attributes or a single stakeholder relationship, business professionals should be able to manage differences in stakeholder relationships.

This article details the broad outlines of the emerging shift, highlighting the new types of enterprise that constitute the SEE. First, we set the context in which business unusual is evolving, a context of ""wicked problems""uncertainty, and sustainability problems. Then we provide an overview of new types of enterprises that are already emerging to cope with these changes, enterprises of the cloud (interlinked, web-based enterprises that rely on the ""cloud"" of computers that store data such as social media, eBay, and Google). Next, we outline how such enterprises are permitting processes of dematerialization and ""servicization"" (the shift from product to services) to create new forms of enterprise that are less dependent on physical resources.

This is one significant reason it is currently believed that in order for scientists to exercise a reliable ethical reflection about their research it is necessary for them to engage in dialogue with other stakeholders. This paper reports on an exercise to encourage a group of scientists to reflect on ethical issues without the presence of external stakeholders. It reports on the use of a reflection process with scientists working in the area of animal disease genomics (mainly drawn from the EADGENE EC Network of Excellence). This reflection process was facilitated by using an ethical engagement framework, a modified version of the Ethical Matrix. As judged by two criteria, a qualitative assessment of the outcomes and the participants' own assessment of the process, this independent reflective exercise was deemed to be successful. The discussions demonstrated a high level of complexity and depth, with participants demonstrating a clear perception of uncertainties and the context in which their research operates. Reflection on stakeholder views and values appeared to be embedded within the discussions. The finding from this exercise seems to indicate that even without the involvement of the wider stakeholder community, valuable reflection and worthwhile discourse can be generated from ethical reflection processes involving only scienitific project partners. Hence, the previous assumption that direct stakeholder engagement is necessary for ethical reflection does not appear to hold true in all cases; however, other reasons for involving a broad group of stakeholders relating to governance and social accountability of science remain. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Animal disease genomics; Ethical matrix; Ethical reflection; Ethics; Participatory methods; Stakeholder engagement","animal; article; attitude; bioethics; demography; ethics; genomics; group process; human; perception; research ethics; social behavior; social psychology; uncertainty; Animals; Attitude; Bioethical Issues; Ethics, Research; Genomics; Group Processes; Humans; Perception; Residence Characteristics; Social Responsibility; Social Values; Uncertainty"

Events comprise those unpredictable things that happen. When they do, organizationally embedded managers will be responsible for making sense of these events. By being responsible, they are enacting ethics in the choices that they make for dealing with them. Events always raise ethical considerations because they are non-routine rather than a strict repetition of existing repertoires. Under certain circumstances, which we illustrate with a theory of the event, drawing on the work of Gilles Deleuze, we are able to investigate the de/institutionalizing of ethics theoretically. We draw on the new economic sociology to discuss the conditions of ethical and event de/institutionalization. Finally, we conceptualize the linkage between micro and macro dimensions framing the dynamics of business ethics in interaction with events. © The Author(s) 2010.","de/institutionalization; Deleuze; ethics; events; global financial crisis; new economic sociology",

Design/methodology/approach: Industry case studies, of the finance and cleaning industries, were undertaken as part of a national research project on quality in traineeships. The two industry case studies were analysed to provide data on social inclusion aspects. A general discussion on the ""pros"" and ""cons"" of gaining qualifications through work, from a social inclusion point of view, is included. Findings: The industry case studies show many advantages of work-based qualifications for people who have had disadvantaged economic and social backgrounds. The study presents a model showing how work-based qualifications help to meet the twin social inclusion goals of employment and education. However in economic hard times, the need to have a job may rule out some people. Also, some doubts about quality in work-based delivery may mean that qualifications gained through work may be of lower value than those gained at least partly through formal study. Research limitations/implications: The models put forward are tentative, based on the findings in the research study that has been described and the authors' earlier research. Further research is necessary to establish the social inclusion benefits of this means of gaining qualifications. In particular longitudinal research with disadvantaged people who have gained qualifications through this route is needed to evaluate whether their completion of qualifications through employment has assisted their broader economic and social engagement, and in what ways. In addition, research is needed to compare the quality and utility of qualifications gained through work and those through education providers as a poor-quality qualification may be of limited long-term use to an individual. Practical implications: Work-based qualifications are shown to be a useful investment of public resources. The research also analyses some shortcomings of this method of gaining qualifications so that they can be addressed by employers and training providers. Social implications: The research establishes the social inclusion utility of work-based qualifications, providing insights useful for education systems and social welfare organisations.

Looking specifically at the work of Chen et al.'s (2009) internal supply chain integration framework, this case explores the impacts of internal supply chain integration on a company's reaction to increased competition and complexity. Chen et al. state, ""few companies identified both factors (consumer and cost orientation) simultaneously"" (p.38). This case demonstrates how one organisation, which does perceive both of these factors simultaneously, responded to external pressures to move towards internal supply chain integration. It thus establishes a further component to the future research prescribed by Chen et al.

We then identify and seek to resolve three residual weaknesses in Mitchell et al.'s (1997) framework, thereby strengthening its foundations for further development. We argue, first, that urgency is not relevant for identifying stakeholders; second, that it is primarily the moral legitimacy of the stakeholder's claim that applies to stakeholder salience; and last, that the salience of stakeholders will vary as the degrees of the attributes vary. These insights inform revised definitions of stakeholder salience and legitimacy, and necessitate a new theoretical underpinning for the role of legitimacy.

Each subsequent section focuses on a version of the story. RC 1, the libertarian free market version celebrates capture as inevitable and desirable. RC 2, the regulators' communitarian take on capture places it in the context of a cycle story with regulators dutifully doing the public's shifting will. In the RC 3 version, the public finds it difficult to piece together a coherent version of the morally charged narrative.

Regardless of the magnitude of the tax or the agents perpetrating it, this fundamental coercive element remains. Tax evasion must consequently be treated as an effort to convert this coercive behavior into voluntary transactions. By altering the conditions of payment and receipt of goods and services, taxation veils both consumers' and producers' preferences. Critics of tax evasion have left unanswered the question as to how society will efficiently allocate its scarce resources under coercively falsified preference signals. Accepting that preferences are best signaled voluntarily and via market participants directly, we argue that tax evasion must result in increased economic efficiency, as well as allow for a reinstatement of an individual's right to contract freely. © 2011 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

I find Wolf's argument compelling in her context of persons, and seek to demonstrate that it remains so when the context is expanded to businesses. I argue that just as moral perfection precludes individuals from challenging societal norms and traditions in ways that benefit us, moral perfection prevents businesses from challenging norms and traditions in ways that can promote positive social change. I also describe, and respond to, three possible objections to my position, most notably the claim that businesses' greater social power justifies demanding moral perfection from them even though we should not demand moral perfection from persons. © 2011 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

If so, can the strategy work in a B2B context, as well as in the B2C context typically covered by research on corporate responsibility? Finally, how does the geopolitical context of a developing Asian nation affect corporate responsibility, from both a managerial and a stakeholder perspective? Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a case study approach, building from observed data to grounded theory. Findings: In a firm where trust and transparency are both ingrained and enforced among managers, Hayleys PLC used those values as tools to transform relations with key stakeholders from costs to marketing assets. In the process, it created an ethical market network in which membership depends on adherence to the same values. Thus emergent ethical marketplaces are directly related to the spread of CR practices. Research limitations/implications: The effects of transparency beyond financial disclosure or sustainability reporting on stakeholder relations would be a particularly valuable object of further research. The structure of ethical markets, and the costs and benefits of participating in them, require and justify further study. Practical implications: An ethical markets strategy can lead to stable long-term relationships with major buyers. However, in the present circumstances, it also entails dependence on a limited number of major customers. Another issue is that, if ""the factory becomes a sales tool"", it may also kill a sale if and when standards slip or a stakeholder creates conflict. Social implications: A corporate responsibility strategy may transform not only managerial practices, but also the social environment, by enabling or disabling stakeholder partners or adversaries. The means to this objective include providing services and empowerment to stakeholders (in this case, workers) who cannot obtain them from their traditional interlocutors. Originality/value: This paper adds insight into the implications of corporate responsibility for firms involved in B2B markets, as well as for Asian multinationals. It also contributes to answering the question of how corporate responsibility adds value, by demonstrating how corporate responsibility may strengthen key productive and commercial relationships with stakeholders essential to the sustainability of the firm. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Labour relations; Labour unions; Sri Lanka; Stakeholder relations; Stakeholders",

This case describes the learning and change process within the company that set the ground for today's success. Design/methodology/approach: This teaching case builds on data gathered through sites visits, interviews and company materials. The case research protocol explored the notion that the company was learning how to interact, and respond to its changing context, while its responses were creating the ground for internal organisational change that in turn would impact the relationship between the company and its context. Findings: While on the surface the change process which Sabaf experienced can be regarded as a move from an implicit to a more explicit approach to corporate responsibility, it is also possible to take the view that the company was engaged in developing a more ""humanistic"" approach to management that permeated the whole organization. What became explicit at Sabaf was not corporate responsibility but rather the term ""corporate responsibility"" used to describe much older concepts of business that valued people and the natural environment alongside economics. The case also shows the process of organizational leadership for learning, management innovation and change that supported the processes through which this approach was developed and integrated into the company. Originality/value: This case provides unique insights into the approach Sabaf adopted in its pioneering transformation to become a leading corporate responsibility company and a world leader in its sector.

There are two main theoretical concepts used to frame the debate-social corporate responsibility and eco-efficiency. The paper describes and analyzes one possible tool local governments have in order to encourage SMEs to become more efficient from an environmental standpoint-the Ecoprofit-type approach. Ecoprofit is a program implemented in Austria and then extended to other countries in which local governments offer training and certificates to SMEs who want to become more eco-efficient. In the empirical research we tested: a) the perceptions and attitudes of SMEs with regard to the greening of their operations and products/ services; and b) whether Romanian SMEs would be interested in taking part in such a program. The conclusion is that SMEs perceive environmental management as a burden and tend to comply only with the mandatory requirements of the law.","Eco-efficiency; Ecoprofit; Environmental responsibility; Public-private partnerships; Romania; Small and medium enterprises",

Design/methodology/approach: The article presents a case study of Indra, a leading Spanish technology company, showing how it has integrated corporate social responsibility within its strategic objectives. Findings: What can you do to get and keep that competitive edge? One firm thinks it has found the answer by incorporating ethical behavior and corporate social responsibility (CSR) into every aspect of its activities. It seems that a corporate culture focused on ethical behavior can improve your standing and reputation inside and outside the company, so that employees, shareholders and communities at large see the organization as ready to do the right thing, rather than motivated exclusively by making money. Practical implications: The article explains how basing competitive advantage on ethics and social responsibility can benefit stakeholders and improve long-term profitability in a technology-driven company. It shows how embedding ethical considerations and CSR as a basic aspect of strategy development and communicating this approach to stakeholders affects employee motivation and behavior, together with company reputation.

Design/methodology/approach: The case study applies an ethical performance evaluation (EPE) managerial framework to evaluate the actions of Nestlé Zimbabwe at various critical decision-making time periods. Findings: While consumer pressure groups and international rights activists in Europe condemned Nestlé's actions in Zimbabwe as unethical and unacceptable, this research found that by exploring the events over time (i.e. longitudinal research) as the context of the event (crisis in Zimbabwe) evolved, it was shown that Nestlé faced a major ethical dilemma; and may have acted ethically and indeed acceptably given the unfolding crisis in Zimbabwe. Research limitations/implications: An EPE managerial framework is a useful tool to provide insight and knowledge of a particular event, however using the framework will not determine what is ethical or not. Evaluating ethical performance is always a value judgement and therefore the framework only offers insight and knowledge into the events over time, allowing the researcher or manager the opportunity to draw better, more informed, ethical decisions. Practical implications: The case study provides an illustration of a dynamic approach that can be used by business managers to assess the ethical performance of a company. Originality/value: The paper proposes that an ethical performance of a company needs to be evaluated over time as the context of the events evolves.

As sport events are intensive in stakeholders' relationships, the creation and strengthening of networks among these stakeholders should be a first priority of strategies aiming at building events' legacies. The purpose of this study is to explore the generation of effective networks in a regional triathlon event using social network analysis theory and techniques. Ten key stakeholders from the sports and tourism areas were interviewed before and after the first edition of the event in 2009 and the data collected were analyzed by means of social network analysis software. Findings indicate that there is an evolution in the structure and complexity of the network, affecting both the social, personal and economic components of relationships and the connectivity among local and external stakeholders. Subsequent implications for managers are drawn to plan strategies that ensure the effectiveness of the event in terms of positive legacies. © 2011 Copyright European Association for Sport Management.","event; impact; network; Sport tourism; stakeholder",

Acting otherwise, he maintains, violates the CEO's fiduciary duty, even for a CEO new to the firm. I argue that Moriarty's conclusion rests on a failure to adequately distinguish when a person acts as a fiduciary from when she acts on her own account as a person. Further, Moriarty's argument assumes that the CEO knows this minimum level of compensation. However, we learn the suitability of compensation only through the market process of wage negotiation, not through some process of introspection. I conclude that a CEO who abstains from interfering with the board of directors and its compensation committee is morally free to negotiate for the highest wage available. © 2011 Business Ethics Quarterly.",,

Value was shown to be multi-dimensional, with a stable pattern of eleven correlated value factors evident in all three samples. The groups differed in their assessments of the different dimensions of value. In all groups, however, value was positively correlated with attitudes and future intentions regarding timeshare. Self-image congruency explained additional criterion variance.

The purpose of this paper is to conduct an empirical study to inquire about the variable growth barriers to Chinese USOs, in order to address two major research questions of this paper: what are the major growth barriers, and how significant they are; and what supports should university and government provide to eliminate those barriers? Design/methodology/approach: In the first place, this paper attempts to explore the research questions through literature review and pilot interviews, based on which, a questionnaire for a survey was developed. Then, this study then attempts to address the research questions through a nation-wide survey in 2009 across 69 national university science parks. Findings: This paper finds that corporate governance issues, managerial concerns, and lack of infrastructure support are three major categories of barriers that thwart the growth of USOs in China. In addition, this paper also identified the support that is expected from universities and government agencies in order to cope with the barriers.

We conducted a laboratory experiment, using a modified dictator game, to identify conditions that entice individuals to lie solely for psychological rewards. We argue that such lies can provide a ready means for individuals to manage others' impression of them. We investigated the effect of social distance (the perceived familiarity, intimacy, or psychological proximity between two parties) and knowledge of circumstances (whether parties have common or asymmetric information) on the frequency of lying. We found that lying occurs more frequently when social distance is near and that the effect is exacerbated when information is asymmetric. Our theoretical development suggests that, under these conditions, individuals' need to manage others' impression is magnified.

It concludes that price discrimination is not inherently unfair. The article also contends that even when conditions i) and/or ii) do not obtain, price discrimination is not necessarily unethical.

Users spend millions of dollars every year consuming items for their avatars. Marketers have begun offering branded items in these communities with mixed results. The purpose of this paper is to examine motivational, usage, and demographic differences in VEs across two popular VE types: reality and fantasy-based platforms. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 106 users of reality and fantasy based VEs was collected using an online survey methodology. Findings: Results indicate that both reality and fantasy worlds are outlets for escapism and immersion. Reality VE users are more motivated to seek social relationships with other users and are more highly involved in the VE than fantasy users. Fantasy-users are motivated by achievement and manipulation of others and are slightly more likely to be male, younger, and engage in the VE with members of their household. Practical implications: Studies suggest that message congruency with the gaming context leads to better attitudes toward advertising in online games. This study suggests that tailoring communications for differences due to VE type may produce more favorable outcomes for marketers. Implications for product and branding strategy are suggested.

It investigates whether engagement with different stakeholders promotes sustainable innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analysis is based on an international sample of 656 large companies, drawn from the annual assessment for the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. A logistic regression analysis was performed in order to test the hypothesized relationships between stakeholder interaction, knowledge management and sustainable innovation orientation. Findings - Empirical results showed that knowledge sourced from engagement with internal and external stakeholders contributes to a firm's sustainable innovation orientation, but that this knowledge has to be managed by the firm internally in order to be converted into new ideas for innovation. Research limitations/implications - Since the present study represents one of the first attempts to characterize stakeholder-driven innovation in a quantitative way, there are some limitations related to the used database that should be addressed in future research. Practical implications - The results show the importance for companies of connecting the business functions of stakeholder engagement and innovation, and find flexible mechanisms to combine access and transformation of relevant stakeholder information.

Further tests are conducted to identify what professional contextual factors and personal value preferences can be introduced to explain the ethical reasoning differences observed. Design/methodology/ approach - Three research questions are raised and related hypotheses are developed and tested by the use of a defined issue test (DIT) instrument containing four hypothetical scenarios of different dilemmatic issues, and a Rokeach values survey questionnaire adapted to suit the Chinese business culture. Findings - The findings and conclusions include: Chinese managers and accountants are not significantly differentiated in terms of ethical reasoning levels measured by the overall DIT instrument, however, the break-down results of the DIT individual dilemmatic scenarios shows that significant differences exist between the two professional types in three out of four scenarios. Second, gender and frequency of making compromises are two significant contextual determinant of ethical reasoning levels of managers but not those of accountants, and for the accountants, no significant contextual factors are observed in the current study. Third, in determining the impacts of value preferences on ethical reasoning levels, the four-factor classification approach produces a more contrasting result than the seven-factor classification approach. Research limitations/implications - The selection of the four scenarios in the DIT instrument is subjective according to the designation of the test, and Chinese business profession's ethical ideologies might differ among different regions. However, these research limitations might inspire further ethics research on cross-regional comparisons in China and other emerging economies. Practical implications - In Chinese surging markets, appropriate socio-economic order can only be maintained by highly ethical reasoning and conduct on the part of business managers and accountants. The current results and findings would help to identify what factors and value preferences weigh more, in order to improve the professional ethicality. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the research literature of business ethics by adding a managers-accountants comparative study on ethical reasoning differences, especially the ethicality of two different professions in emerging economies; further, it includes contextual factors and value preferences in identifying those determinants of ethical reasoning differences.

Although they took great care in researching, specifying the work, and hiring Nye Contracting, they encountered problems from the start with the contractor, his various crews, interruptions and delays in the work schedule, and poor quality work. The last straw for the Stewarts was Nye's demand for additional money for materials to complete the job. He also threatened to place a lien on the Stewart's home until the additional money requirement was met. At this point, the Stewarts feel compelled to document their refusal to pay additional money to Nye and to hold Nye to the terms of their initial agreement, to clarify their position to his demands, to document the extent (percentage) of the work accomplished to date in order to calculate what percentage of the agreed-upon wages should be paid to date, to specify what jobs still need to be done, and to document the deterioration of their business relationship with Nye for possible legal action. Alternatively, however, the Stewarts are considering more positive communication in the hopes of convincing Nye to complete the job he agreed to perform initially and to maintain goodwill. © 2011 by the DreamCatchers Group, LLC, Arden NC, USA.",,

However, there seems to be no comprehensive review and synthesis of ethics management literature in construction. This research aims to address the theory-practice gap by providing a critical review of the ethics decision-making literature. Design/methodology/approach - The study examines critically the ethics decision-making literature from the 1980s to 2008. Findings - Three research focuses, relating to the construction industry in ethical decision making, are identified: empirical studies on examining the associations between variables (individuals, situational/organisational, moral intensity) and employees' ethical behaviour in construction organisational contexts; continuous application of behavioural science theories to develop an appropriate ethical decision-making model for the industry; and research on group and/or organisational level behaviour ethics. Research limitations/implications - The study identifies, draws together, and integrates existing theories and research, with a particular emphasis on ethical decision-making models, to present the key contributions in the realm of ethics decision making. Practical implications - The paper highlights the role of management (both as an academic discipline and from a practitioner perspective) in bridging this gap. Originality/value - The research adds value to the literature on ethics management, where limited knowledge exists in the construction industry. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Construction industry; Ethical decision-making; Ethics management","Behavioural science; Business ethics; Critical review; Decision making models; Design/methodology/approach; Empirical studies; Ethical decision-making; Ethics management; Organisational level; Research limitations; Social responsibilities; Behavioral research; Construction industry; Decision theory; Philosophical aspects; Research; Decision making"

The conceptual framework offers important insights regarding the instrumental motives of managers in performing CSP initiatives. Based on a sample of 124 S&P 500 firms, the authors found that it is a firm's visibility to stakeholders, rather than its economic performance, that has the larger impact on managers' decisions regarding how much CSP their firms exhibit. The results show that more profitable firms may not be motivated to engage actively in CSP unless they are under greater scrutiny by various firm stakeholders. The authors also found that organizational slack (estimated as cost of capital) is positively associated with a Social CSP dimension but negatively associated with a Strategic CSP dimension.

The importance of these scholarly inquiries has been underscored by the recent condemnation of high executive remuneration levels in the face of corporate failures and financial declines. Most researchers confine their analyses to single equation models that test various determinants and different measures of compensation. In this paper, we expand this approach to a multi-equation model that examines the determinants of executive compensation within a broader framework. Our specification explicitly allows for the endogeneity of executive compensation, firm financial performance, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Chief among our findings is that this endogeneity assumption is supported, which means that financial performance and social performance are determined simultaneously. We further show that CSR is among the determinants of CEO pay, which indicates that pay-for-performance does not sufficiently explain compensation. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.","Agency theory; Corporate financial performance (CFP); Corporate social performance (CSP); Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Executive compensation; Pay-for-performance; Social performance measures; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable development",

For, though such businesses violate human rights they have been largely ignored by business ethicists. It is time to surmount this indifference in view of recent international efforts to define illicit businesses for regulatory purposes. Standing in the way, however, is a meta-ethical question as to whether any business can be declared unqualifiedly immoral. In support of an affirmative answer I address a number of counter-indications by comparing approaches to organized crime and to corporate crime, comparing the ethical critique of businesses studied in business ethics and those socially banned, and comparing the business ethics assumption as to businesses' ethicality to societal ethical neutrality regarding war-related businesses. My conclusion: to help advance respect for human rights, business ethicists should apply their expertise to the task of defining illicit businesses. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate crime; corporate social responsibility; human rights; illicit business; international law; organized crime; UNGC",

Design/methodology/approach: The changed status from a net oil exporter to net importer in 2004, the highly subsidized price of fossil fuel, the depleting oil resources and a strong dependency on oil for domestic production are the driving forces for introducing biofuel in Indonesia. The Indonesian government enacted an energy policy in 2006 which aims to partially shift fossil fuel consumption to renewable energy sources including biofuel. The mandatory requirement to use biofuel and the given subsidies will help to make biofuel competitive. However, till now, biofuel still has not achieved the aimed target for several reasons, e.g. higher cost of production relative to fossil fuel, distribution barriers due to geographical constraints, reluctance from industry due to uncertain markets and relative low participation from local government. This paper develops strategic analysis based on the diffusion process of biofuel development. Findings: The tools applied are a SWOT analysis, Porter 5 Force analysis, and Business Portfolio analysis to understand the position of the biofuel industry.

The extent to which these efforts, in addition to informing about the company stance on ethics, are able to positively influence behavior is disputed. In contrast, research on business ethics communication and behavior indicates a relatively clear, positive link between open workplace dialogue about ethical issues and ethical conduct. In this article, I therefore address the question: What influences employee attitudes to talking openly about ethical issues? Answers are proposed on the basis of focus group interviews with staff at the Denmark and Brazil affiliates of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk. It was found that interest in discussing ethical issues was influenced by two main factors: employee conceptualizations of business ethics and the level of inter-collegial trust, credibility, and confidence.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the approach of a literature review of texts from intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, to develop a synthesis of issues, before literature review from management studies, development studies and international relations, to revise the synthesis and identify policy relevant future research. Findings: Governance at all levels but particularly the international level involves corporations and their stakeholders. Together they have created non-statutory corporate social responsibility (CSR) standards which now influence significant amounts of international trade and investment, thereby presenting new benefits, risks and challenges for sustainable development. Governments around the world are now innovating public policies on these standards, which can be categorised to inform policy development: governments prepare, prefer, promote and prescribe CSR standards. Therefore, a new dimension to collaborative governance is emerging and would benefit from research and technical assistance.

Indeed, they in some ways promote the mobilisation of accounting in the context. We go on to elaborate further how accounting (we especially focus upon corporate accounting and reporting) may come to the service of human rights.

Not only are boards considering how they might engage with key stakeholders, but stakeholders are also pursuing greater participation in the strategic decisions of companies in which they invest. While this is an emerging concept in companies governed by unitary boards, as in North America, the issue of stakeholder engagement in various forms is also entering debate in other countries around the world. In general, however, the idea of shareholder or stakeholder representation on the boards of most UK and Commonwealth companies is anathema. Forces now influencing the development of strategies for stakeholder engagement and the rise of active investors include changing corporate governance rules which give investors more power in the election of directors, the increasing role of pension plans and hedge fund investment groups which have produced investors who keep a close eye on company performance and value, and a sluggish or turbulent stock market as a result of the financial crisis initiated by the credit crunch in the sub-prime mortgage markets. In this paper the phenomenon of stakeholder representation is examined and results of a recent survey conducted among a large sample of New Zealand directors are presented. The findings suggest that these traditionally oriented boards are increasingly inwardly focused and are without an agenda for building and managing shareholder and stakeholder relations. Accordingly, such boards are unlikely to regard stakeholder engagement as a serious strategic issue and are thus also likely to miss significant opportunities in the changed business environment to benefit from stakeholder support. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Board of directors; Financial crisis; New Zealand; Shareholder activism; Stakeholder relations",

In an attempt to begin to explore the extent to which, if any, the language of human rights has entered the discourse of corporate accountability, this paper investigates the adoption of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) human rights standards by major multinational garment retail companies that source products from developing countries, as disclosed through their reporting media. The paper has three objectives. Firstly, to empirically explore the extent to which a group of multinational garment retailers invoke the language of human rights when disclosing their corporate responsibilities. The paper reviews corporate reporting media including social responsibility codes of conduct, annual reports and stand-alone social responsibility reports released by 18 major global clothing and retail companies during a period from 1990 to 2007. We find that the number of companies adopting and disclosing on the ILO's workplace human rights standards has significantly increased since 1998 - the year in which the ILO's standards were endorsed and accepted by the global community (ILO, 1998). Secondly, drawing on a combination of Responsive Regulation theory and neo-institutional theory, we tentatively seek to understand the regulatory space that may have influenced these large corporations to adopt the language of human rights obligations. In particular, we study the role that International Governmental Organisation's (IGO) such as ILO may have played in these disclosures. Finally, we provide some critical reflections on the power and potential within the corporate adoption of the language of human rights. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Human rights; Institutional theory; International Governmental Organisation; International Labour Organisation; Multinational companies; Responsive regulation",

Design/methodology/approach: The paper proceeds to a conceptual deconstruction of consumer cynicism by comparing the contemporary meaning of the term with the original signification of cynicism, contrasting the psychological approach with the philosophical one. This perspective sheds light on disparate forms of consumer cynicism found in previous research. Findings: Four different figures of consumption related to cynicism were distinguished in this paper. Defensive cynicism and offensive cynicism are psychological tools used to neutralize persuasion attempts or divert marketing techniques. Subversive cynicism and ethical cynicism, which are reminiscences of cynicism in Ancient Greece, challenge the consumerist ideology and even propose an alternative ethics. Originality/value: Prior research on consumer cynicism has focused on the defensive psychological dimension of the concept, limiting it to a coping device for deceived consumers. Three other facets have been explored in this paper and provide a broader framework that can account for the disparate manifestations observed in the resistance and anti-consumption literature.

Previous studies have focused on implications of guanxi for business outcomes; few have examined guanxi development, which is the purpose of this study. Two theoretical modes of dynamic guanxi processes in the workplace are proposed: working guanxi and backdoor guanxi. The two modes differ in frequency of interaction, frequency of exchange of favors, and how clear the parties are on what each stands to gain from a particular interaction. Although face is expected to play a role in the development of each, the type of face that is most important differs. For working guanxi, lian (personal character) is most important. For backdoor guanxi, mianzi (status) is most important. Backdoor guanxi is the mode most likely to be associated with corruption, bribery, and client-patron relations.

This study examined newspaper editorials, letters to the editor, op-ed columns, news analyses, and guest columns for three aspects: media attention, media prominence, and media valence. Results showed an increase in the number of opinion pieces covering CSR issues over the 25-year period. The prominence of each of the four CSR dimensions varied over time. Each of the four CSR dimensions had its moment of media prominence when it was more important than the other dimensions. The most prevalent valence of the opinion pieces was negative; the volume of negative pieces increased over the 25 years, whereas the number of opinions with positive, neutral, and mixed tones showed little change over time.

However, little is known about the underlying processes that influence how customers bond with a service firm and its employees. This article explains customer-firm and customer-employee relationships using attachment theory. It provides theoretical and empirical evidence that customers with low levels of attachment anxiety and low levels of attachment avoidance perceive a service firm and service employee more positively-in terms of satisfaction, trust, and affective commitment-than customers with high levels. However, since a service firm and service employee are separate attachment targets, this study also tests whether customers have a similar propensity to bond with both. Insecurely attached customers who find interpersonal bonds with employees deficient, compensate for this deficiency by being more likely to bond with the service firm. Companies that measure customer attachment styles can better segment markets, manage customer relationships, and allocate resources more effectively. For example, customers with low levels of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance toward the firm are candidates for social relationship programs, whereas customers with high levels of attachment avoidance are likely to be more responsive to financial reward programs. © The Author(s) 2011.","Attachment styles; Attachment theory; Market segmentation; Relationship marketing; Satisfaction",

Signatory companies voluntarily agree to abide by the GC ten principles and explicitly declare compliance with social and human rights, environmental protection, and anti-corruption practices. Participants commit to CSR and are required to publish a yearly report called Communication on Progress (COP). If firms fail to provide a COP for one year they are labeled ""non-communicating"", and for two years they are ""delisted"" from the GC. In 2006, the first list of non-communicating and delisted firms was announced. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent by which being a signatory company - that reports COP - reduces information risk, and thus leads to better market returns, lower cost of debt, and lower cost of equity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors studied the period from the launch of the GC until the first list of non-communicating firms was made public, investigating the extent by which being a signatory company - that reports COP - reduces information risk, and thus leads to better market returns, lower cost of debt, and lower cost of equity. Findings: The results suggest that communicating (reporting) firms have statistically significant higher market valuation - lower book to market - than companies that initially agree to participate in the GC but that do not comply with the reporting requirement. Communicating firms also have statistically significant higher ROA, lower cost of debt, lower cost of equity, and lower beta indicating better performance and less risk. The authors also find some evidence that non-communicating firms might be ""free riding"" and could have joined the GC to improve their corporate image. Originality/value: The paper provides evidence of the value of CSR reporting. It is not enough to disclose compliance with CSR, but it is also necessary to account for this through some sort of formal mechanism such as a CSR report. Voluntary disclosures and narrative statements in annual reports will continue to have questionable information content, but standards of environmental reporting, such as the Global Reporting Initiative, not only improve the way in which social and environmental performance is measured, but they also provide evidence of compliance. This paper also presents evidence of the value of voluntary initiatives such as the GC when these initiatives are supported by formal reporting and when accountability/enforcement measures are in place. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Citizenship; Communication on Progress (COP); Corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting; Global Compact; Performance and CSR; Voluntary disclosure; Voluntary reporting",

Based on the literature, we develop hypotheses for three determinants of leadership: social relationships, reputation, and gender. Social relationships concern the importance of the network connections; reputation recognizes the importance of science ability; characteristics include individual traits such as gender. We test the resulting model on the likelihood of attaining three different types of academic science leadership - center leadership, university administrative leadership, and discipline leadership. Regression analysis uses data from a National Science Foundation funded survey of scientists in which social network, attitudinal and behavior data were collected to understand how social networks affect career trajectories of men and women. Findings show that while science reputation is strongly associated with center and discipline leadership, it is less strongly associated with administrative leadership. Also, large dense collaboration networks are important for center leadership, but the opposite is true for administrative leadership. Women are more likely to be in discipline leadership positions and less likely to be a leader of a research center or have an administrative university leadership position. Finally, having more women in the network reduces the likelihood of attaining discipline or center leadership positions.

This is suggested by an increasing need for accomplishing an integrative view on business activities and social aims - the so-called corporate social responsibility - especially in the current environmentally turbulent time and a rising socially conscious consumer population. But doing business is often associated with brand- or corporate misconduct as well. Hence, corporate social responsibility forms the positive component of corporate social performance (CSP), consequently a favorable brand- or company behavior. Corresponding, corporate social irresponsibility or misconduct forms the negative part of such performance. Considering this definition a model is conceptualized to analyze the integrative effect of CSP on consumer perception of brands in terms of brand personality. This study examines how CSP as a whole, and social responsible behavior and brand misconduct individually, affect the brand personality. Furthermore, the investigation scrutinizes the causal connections between brand personality and behavior-oriented brand equity to consider the economic relevance of our case. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","brand equity; brand misconduct; brand personality; corporate social performance; corporate social responsibility; negativity effect",

A subtext in Freeman's thought is baseball. I shall address all of these, with stakeholder at the center, but I shall suggest some Aristotelian views that Freeman should find congenial. At least they aff ord an opportunity to continue the conversation. Since there are many possible theories about stakeholders, I am content to make some general and useful observations about them. Freeman, Harrison and Wicks (2007) off er two such observations. I agree with both of them, under an interpretation that may involve a little friendly extrapolation. The first is that a certain kind of win-win situation is an essential aim of managing with stakeholders in mind. The second is that values are essential as well. Put the two together and we can say that one can and should create an ongoing win-win situation with stakeholders through conversations that get at common values.According to the standard view of things, a firm marshals its resources and, in particular, its managers and employees to defeat its competitors in the market and thus make profits for its stockholders. Where do stakeholders come in? Some critics have interpreted the stakeholder approach as claiming that an organization has an affirmative moral obligation to some or all stakeholders. Even the Milton Friedman (1970) view of corporate responsibility can accommodate the presence of stakeholders: they are to be dealt with in whatever way the firm's profitable operation requires. They may off er obstacles, support and challenges of various sorts. Firms should regard dealing with stakeholders as a means to corporate success. That view is consistent with exploitative treatment of stakeholders; but since an organization might have difficulty in getting away with that sort of thing for very long, a Friedmanite could advocate treating stakeholders honestly. This chapter explores a notion that lies somewhere between Friedman and serve- all- the- stakeholders. I argue, following Freeman, that a firm ought to seek win-win situations with stakeholders where that is feasible. This makes good sense from the point of view of the stockholders, and it has something to do with fairness as well.1 The point is not just that the results of most transactions will provide some benefit for both parties, as is typical in competitive markets. I shall argue that where relations with stakeholders have the characteristics of the prisoner's dilemma or the commons, as is often the case, standard negotiation is not always the best way to get the parties to win-win. But not all stakeholder relationships can be win-win. Sometimes a trade- off is the best possible option, and in those cases there is not always a handy principle that tells one how to trade. I claim that the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons model some stakeholder relationships, and that in these cases good stakeholder management is a matter of avoiding the dilemma or the tragedy. Then I consider the claim, made by the Canadian political philosopher Charles Blattberg (2000), that relationships between contesting parties should be addressed through conversation, a process in which the parties reach an accord by coming to adopt common values rather than agreeing to disagree and then compromising. We might think that this view works better as a theory about citizens than about stakeholders, but I shall argue that it does apply to stakeholders, including even competitors. Stakeholders should be able to agree on the value of competing honestly on the basis of excellence. Businesspeople should be excellent competitors in a sense that I shall explain. That is what brings out the productive best in capitalism. We might want to have a coherent set of principles that describe the best possible stakeholder relations in all possible circumstances, but there are no such principles. Pragmatists know that that is the way it often is in moral philosophy, though principles are not useless. Our consideration of how to deal with stakeholders leads us to contemplate good character, and the pride and satisfaction to which good character is entitled. I shall argue that a virtue- based approach can add value to stakeholder theory. It may seem odd to say that business is about finding some common goods and converging on values. Surely competitors and employees and other stakeholders are not all in the same boat, not united as fellow citizens ought to be. I do not minimize differences among stakeholder classes; in particular, I recognize the centrality of competition. But stakeholders can and should unite behind a conception of honest competition, and a conception of what an excellent businessperson, a real pro, looks like We begin by considering an important class of stakeholders. © Robert A.

In doing so, we develop two primary contributions: First, we expand the stakeholder group concept into a stakeholder tetrad that includes how managers perceive the issues and requested actions that stakeholder groups bring to the firm via a request tactic - which we term the accordion effect. Second, we build on Mitchell and colleagues' (1997) suggestion that power, legitimacy and urgency attributes define the salience of stakeholders for managers by reallocating these attributes along the newly formed stakeholder tetrad, and by exploring in greater depth the relationships that exist between these attributes, which lead them to compound and/or interact in certain applications - which is captured in the snowball effect. We further augment the model by considering the impact of stakeholder group status on the degree of managerial attention granted to stakeholders.

One of the most important behaviors in the domain of CSP is volunteerism. This study examined the reciprocal causal relationship between volunteerism and life satisfaction.

Several theoretical mechanisms served as the foundation for the hypothesized relationships between the variables in the study. The results of this study indicated that there is indeed a reciprocal causal relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism, though the link from life satisfaction to volunteerism has received more support in the general sample than from volunteerism to life satisfaction.

Following literature on the links between corporate social performance and financial performance, we attempt to validate if the relationship between environmental innovations and financial performance is not just unidirectional but likewise bi-directional. This comparative case study of Japanese automotive and electronics companies aims to: (1) determine if environmental innovations positively impact financial performance in prior years; (2) alternatively explore if financial performance in prior years positively impact environmental innovations; (3) establish if virtuous cycles exist in the relationships of variables; and (4) probe further if the directions, impacts or relationships hold consistently over a longitudinal period. Panel data regression analysis was performed for ten automotive and ten electronic companies listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, to determine the impact of the variables on each other for both directions from 2001 to 2009. Granger causality tests were performed to establish virtuous cycles. Finally, the same statistical techniques were employed on disaggregated data sets for the periods, 2001 to 2006 and 2004 to 2009, to capture any longitudinal differences. Our findings which point to the stark contrasts between the automotive and electronics companies, allow us to support earlier theorization and propose rival theories for results contrary to expectations. The automotive companies exemplify the resource-based view perspective as positive impacts of environmental innovations that are observed on revenues, profits, assets, long-term debt and equity, and vice-versa. However, these impacts seem to weaken over time. The electronics companies show only revenues and long-term debt as significantly controlled by environmental innovations and vice-versa. There are, likewise, longitudinal differences as a result of the recent global economic crisis in the industry. Virtuous cycles for all variables of financial performance have only been established for a number of automotive companies, and for one electronics company.",,

In response to this attrition, this article presents three arguments. First, we suggest that trust is the ""glue"" of any viable political economy, and we propose that the stakes of violating public trust are particularly high in light of the asymmetry between trust and distrust. Second, we identify a constellation of key barriers to overcoming distrust that companies face in the current environment: (1) corporate mind-sets that promote a preoccupation with quantification, hierarchical leadership models, and ""blind trust"" in authority; (2) the anonymity of core stakeholders; (3) the agency of the media as a driver of the political economy; and (4) firm-centric models of stakeholder relationships. Third, we argue that, notwithstanding these challenges, these phenomena are not fatal and can be addressed through a holistic transformation in corporate culture. Such a transformation might include a shift to collaborative leadership models and replacing authority models with responsibility, a ""names and faces"" approach to stakeholders through cases and stories, more egalitarian communication exchanges with external stakeholders, and a reprioritization of the firm as a vital element among others within a system rather than the central core of a network. We conclude that the value of trust at the individual, institutional, national, and global levels cannot be overstated.

Agency theorists and financial economists often claim that such actions to pursue corporate social responsibility are frequently efforts by senior managers seeking perquisites that necessarily impose costs upon shareholders. Others scholars agree that managers have discretion and are diverting shareholder returns but interpret these initiatives as altruistic and motivated by managers' morality. A growing body of organizational economists, identify market conditions under which the diversion of shareholder returns to enhance social responsibility may, in fact, be optimal for a manager because they lead to a reduction in the cost of capital, improve employee productivity, increase consumer willingness to pay or reduce activists' efforts to impose financial losses on the company. While acknowledging the existence of these causal mechanisms as well as managerial agency, we wish to call attention to an alternative and more direct driver of efforts by managers to improve external stakeholder perceptions of responsibility. We argue and present evidence that there exist cases in which such efforts, rather than diverting shareholder rents or moving the firm into a market niche with an alternative higher cost product, can be inputs into a more efficient production process. We undertake this analysis using panel data on 26 gold mines over the period 1993-2008. We code over 50,000 stakeholder events from media reports to develop an index of the degree of stakeholder cooperation or conflict for these mines and demonstrate that this measure of political and social capital is an important component, together with characteristics of the mine and the price of gold, in calculating the financial market valuation of the 19 publicly traded parent firms.","Political risk; Stakeholder relations; Strategic corporate social responsibility","Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Cost of capital; Economic returns; Efficient production; Employee productivity; Financial loss; Financial market; Financial returns; Market condition; Market niche; Multi-national corporations; Panel data; Political risks; Senior managers; Shareholder returns; Social capitals; Social responsibilities; Social support; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder perception; Stakeholder relations; Willingness to pay; Costs; Economics; Gold; Losses; Managers; Shareholders; Textile industry; Economic and social effects"

From the analysis of the evolution of the different concepts as corporate social responsibility, then sustainable development and global corporate social responsibility, the first part of the chapter argues that corporate citizenship is both the result of societal change and an undeniable constraint.

The paper weaves together new strands of research in business ethics with the current debate on sustainability. The argument is made in three steps. The first step sketches how the sustainability semantics has evolved from a sociopolitical searchlight to a heuristics for business policy and practice. Elaborating a key proposition of the ordonomic perspective on business ethics, the second step argues that business firms can use moral commitments as a factor of production by deploying individual or collective selfcommitments as well as commitment services in processes of new governance. In the third step, we combine these four moral commitments with the three ESG ('ecological, social, and governance') criteria of sustainability and derive a 12-box matrix for commitment strategies. We use three case studies to illustrate how this ordonomic matrix can be used to enhance strategic management for corporate sustainability.","Business ethics; Strategic management; Sustainability","Business ethics; Business policies; Commitment strategy; Corporate-sustainability; In-process; Strategic management; Industry; Philosophical aspects; Semantics; Strategic planning; Sustainable development"

If some socially desirable activity is profitable, then it is best described as ""intelligent operation of the business"" and thus CSR is irrelevant. If the socially desirable activity is not profitable, then companies will not voluntarily undertake it unless required to do so by law or regulation, and thus CSR will be ineffective. The concept of CSR is ""intensely confused"" because in both the above cases it is not a useful construct. Rivoli and Waddock propose to get out of this logical trap by analyzing CSR ""in a more dynamic, time-and context-dependent manner."" Unfortunately, the presumed escape route turns out to be a dead end. CSR is best defined as: a company has a corporate social responsibility to voluntarily undertake socially desirable behavior that decreases the firm's profits. Laws and regulation are much more effective than CSR at inducing firms to implement socially desirable behavior that reduces firm profits.",,

Serious ethical and societal concerns underline this astroturfing practice, especially if corporations are successful in influencing public opinion by undertaking a social movement approach. This study is motivated by this particular issue and examines the effectiveness of astroturf organizations in the global warming context, wherein large corporate polluters have an incentive to set up astroturf organizations to undermine the importance of human activities in climate change. We conduct an experiment to determine whether astroturf organizations have an impact on the level of user certainty about the causes of global warming. Results show that people who used astroturf websites became more uncertain about the causes of global warming and humans' role in the phenomenon than people who used grassroots websites. Astroturf organizations are hence successful in promoting business interests over environmental protection. In addition to the multiple business ethics issues it raises, astroturfing poses a significant threat to the legitimacy of the grassroots movement. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Astroturfing; Business ethics; Climate change; Global warming; Grassroots organizations; Legitimacy; Rhetoric",

Not only does the meaning of CR constantly shift, but so do public expectations and the baseline of acceptable corporate practice. New CR behaviors become common practice through two mechanisms. New norms of industry-wide practices evolve in response to shifting stakeholder expectations and demands, in response to changing laws and regulations. Moreover, changes in laws are often facilitated by evolving voluntary CR norms. As either norms of behavior or laws shift over time, the ""business case"" for certain CR behaviors strengthens, but at the same time the very definition of CR shifts as firms find themselves pressured to adopt additional CR behaviors, whose business benefts may initially be unclear. This time dynamic thus changes what is profitable for companies and reveals that what is and is not responsible corporate practice is both time-and context-dependent rather than universal.",,

The definition suggests that firms take on a broader objective beyond that of a singular focus of maximising profits. However, businesses cannot be expected to solve all of society's problems or its development needs, nor bear the full cost of doing so. Thus, a strategic approach is required.

Luxury is in some cases created by companies controlling the so-called user imagery of their customers, i.e., by companies encouraging =desirable' individuals to consume their products and obstructing =undesirable' individuals from consumption. This chapter critically analyses the implications of this corporate practice based on a study of Sweden's most luxurious nightclub. The study's results show that the nightclub has organised its activities to allow categorisations of individuals into =desirable' and =undesirable' customers. Furthermore, the study shows that a creation of =misery' for the vast majority of individuals (the =undesirable') is essential for creating =enjoyment' for the selected few (the =desirable'). The chapter concludes by discussing implications for practitioners interesting in altering this situation. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",,

Empirical research about extant business practices is conducted in one or both of the positivist and interpretive research paradigms. Development of new business practices, rather than simply examining existing ones, is conducted by research within the Design Science Research (DSR) paradigm. The DSR paradigm emphasises the invention, design, and development of new technologies, techniques, and methods, yet still achieving research rigour. Critically examining organisational practices and goals other than profit, such as business ethics, sustainability, and the triple bottom line, is much better conducted within the Critical Research (CR) paradigm, which critically examines the purpose, goals, and social and societal impacts of business and other practices. Unfortunately, the Introduction to Business Research Methods courses and textbooks that develop the business research community's fledgling members' ability to conduct, interpret, and critique and develop high quality research typically place heavy if not exclusive emphasis on positivist and interpretive research paradigms and methods at the expense of other research paradigms and methods. Such exclusive emphasis on positivist and interpretive research at the expense of other paradigms handicaps new researchers and severely limits their future ability to conduct, interpret, critique, and develop high quality research. To address this problem, this paper describes how DSR and CR have been successfully incorporated within an introductory business research methods course, which introduces students, regardless of their specific business discipline, to business research. The paper describes how it (1) deals with textbooks that have a limited perspective on business research paradigms and methods and (2) provides a needed, holistic perspective on business research, regardless of the specific discipline. To accomplish the above, the new course does four specific things. First, it situates business research as an applied discipline, along with other applied disciplines, such as medicine and engineering, and in contrast to non-applied disciplines, such as physics or psychology. Second, it includes a key new framework that contrasts the assumptions and perspectives of different research paradigms, including business research knowledge goals, the role of values in research, and epistemological issues. Third, it modifies and extends frameworks and figures from a popular business research methods textbook to supplement the limited perspective of the textbook with alternative research goals and paradigms. Fourth, the new course adds relevant introductory readings. The paper presents these extensions to the course, including how and where they are included within the course presentation, materials, and assessments, as a model for others wishing to enhance their introductory business research methods courses. © Academic Publishing International Ltd.","Business research; Critical research; Curriculum design; Design science research; Research methods; Teaching",

The research built an in-depth understanding of how to deliver an improvement in the sustainable development of local rural Indian villages. The sustainable development projects are developed and implemented by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) but are part funded through the corporate responsibility programme of a multi national Bank. The research focused on the processes used in the projects, how they were implemented and the outcomes achieved. The research is unusual in management research, in that it takes a stakeholder perspective rather than the more customary corporate perspective. Consequently the focus is on understanding the processes, implementation and outcomes from the perspective of three groups of stakeholders. The three groups are the Bank, the NGOs and the villagers who are the end recipients of the projects. This paper does not explore the outcomes of this research but rather describes the research methodology undertaken to effectively execute the research. The research methodology chosen was that of case study with an interpretivist stance. Whilst case study can be an umbrella term for multiple data collection tools, there was a focus on collecting data via discussion and observation, in line with the interpretivist paradigm. To achieve the required level of discussion and observation was facilitated by undertaking an ethnographically-styled approach. This ethnographic-styled approach included the researcher spending time living in the Indian villages with respondents to understand the outcomes of the sustainable development projects which had been undertaken from their perspective. The data gathering processes include structured, semi-structured and in-depth interviews across the three primary stakeholder groups of respondents. Other data gathering included observation, documentation, artefacts, video and photographs. In summary this paper provides an insight into a method for undertaking research in a local rural developing country context. It particularly focuses on taking a stakeholder perspective to corporate interventions in a community, rather than the more usual company focused approach. It further contributes to the development of appropriate methodology for contexts where the researcher is from a different cultural and linguistic background to the respondents. © Academic Publishing International Ltd.","Ethnographic-styled approach; Interpretivist case study; Language barriers in research; Research in a developing country; Video research",

While Friedman's iconic defense of profit maximization as the responsibility of management has been widely and extensively assailed, emerging positions on the role of business in society offer little clear and practical guidance to current managers, as well as Masters of Business Administration students. I argue in this article that the focus of the debate should shift to considering how the rules of the game surrounding business' behavior should be formulated and what the role of socially responsible managers should be in helping to establish those rules. My contention is that the goal of society should be to strengthen the linkage between the achievement of social objectives and profit maximization by business through ""bright line"" regulations and laws. Socially responsible managers will participate in setting the rules of the game by advising policymakers on how specific regulations and laws can be structured so that they most effectively condition the linkage between social objectives and profit maximization. If there is a unique social responsibility of managers beyond profit maximization, it is to participate in the policymaking process ""honestly,"" that is, without attempting to game the system through guile and opportunism. © 2011 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Pragmatism is especially relevant to those organizational scholars who are concerned with understanding the dynamic processes and practices of organizational life. This chapter lays out the historical development of Pragmatism, recognizing the originating contributions of Peirce, James, Dewey and Mead. Although each of these writers developed unique philosophical positions, their ideas are all permeated by four key themes: experience, inquiry, habit and transaction. The interplay between these themes informs a temporal view of social practice in which selves and situations are continuously constructed and reconstructed through experimental and reflexive processes of social engagement. We then use organizational learning theory as an example to illustrate the relevance of these four themes, contrasting the anti-dualistic stance of Pragmatism with the work of Argyris and Schön. Finally we turn to consider Weick's organizing and sensemaking, suggesting that Pragmatism offers three potential foci for further development of these theories, namely continuity of past and future in the present, the transactional nature of social agency and reflexivity in social practices. Similarly we see potential for Pragmatism to productively inform the theorizing of other organizational practices such as identity work, strategy work, emotion work and idea work.",,

The word ""incorruptibility"" has been defined as a firm resistance to all the enormous temptations of power, a continuing and inflexible dedication to the public good rather than benefits for oneself or one's group. This chapter explores cutting edge research in developmental psychology and neuroscience which suggests that increasing incorruptibility of character and greater integration of brain functioning are both associated with systematic experiences of a state of consciousness in which one gains a inner sense of self-knowledge that is completely self-referential and independent of outer circumstances. This fundamental approach of development of individual consciousness complements the more superficial efforts of corporations, governments, and international organizations to fortify ethical standards through regulation, codes of professional conduct, the cultivation of ethical cultures, and the adoption of global principles of responsible management. This chapter analyzes the notion of corruptibility and its relation to recent high profile cases of corporate corruption and the development of corporate codes of conduct. It proceeds to develop a foundation for corporate ethical codes based on a model derived from the model of Indian Vedic philosophy and psychology.

Environmental standardization is a unique fusion of technology design and public policy development involving various constituencies: environmentalists, technologists, legislatures, regulators, standards-setting bodies, upstream suppliers, downstream users, and society's affected communities.

It is predicated on the idea that major advances in knowledge will transpire when scholars, while pursuing their research interests, also consider addressing the core problems confronting society. For a workable engaged agenda in science and technology studies, one that informs scholarship as well as shapes practice and policy, the traditional terms of engagement must be renegotiated to be more open and mutual than has historically characterized the nature of inquiry in this field.

Research to date has demonstrated that corporate social responsibility is associated with attracting job-seekers and enhancing the engagement of employees. However, much of this research focuses on the impact of corporate social responsibility on employee outcomes independent of the impact of traditional human resource practices (e.g. training, rewards). Using a variation of an existing employee opinion survey, and applying Carroll's (1979) model of corporate social responsibility, this paper assesses the relationship between employee engagement, traditional human resource practices, and corporate social responsibility. Data collected from 3147 employees showed a significant positive correlation between corporate social responsibility and employee engagement. However, corporate social responsibility explained little additional variance in engagement beyond that explained by traditional human resource practices. This paper concludes that allocating attention and resources to corporate social responsibility may not be as advantageous as investing in the improvement of core human resource practices, when the goal is to improve employee engagement. Future research needs to examine why corporate social responsibility explains little additional variance in employee engagement, specifically examining the manner in which employees perceive corporate social responsibility and the extent to which corporate social responsibility encompasses traditional human resource practices. © The Author(s) 2011.","business ethics; corporate performance; corporate social responsibility; employee engagement; human resources",

Moreover, its importance is also evident according to the worldwide increase of organizations and/or institutions that have implemented ethics systems. However, some approaches thoroughly do not consider the importance and the need of an ethical behaviour and are still guiding the actions and the way of thinking of many academics and professionals led to consider that the only responsibility of business is limited just to profit maximization. After analyzing and debating the postulates of this line of thought, this paper concludes that the companies bear the responsibility of behaving ethically. This responsibility does not exclusively imply serving and being fair to its shareholders as the only actors to care about. Its fulfilment requires the recognition of other actors in scene, its stakeholders, to constitute a consistent basis on which companies can satisfactorily operate in the market. The implementation of an ethical management system (from now on EMS) can contribute to the generation of an ethical culture and to the improvement of the moral quality of the whole organization.

We argue that this public transcript of whistleblowing/silence overshadows the importance of continuing research into alternative (individual or collective) employee behaviour. Drawing on original research with a financial services organisation, our research uncovers a dissenting discourse that operates through implicit communication, such as codes, sarcasm and jokes.

Even though there are some practical experiences, too little is understood about how to promote learning and capacity building to spur green innovation through sustainable investments in small enterprises in LDCs. This article analyses the obstacles to make partnerships happen between two small firms and sustainable foreign investors in Brazil. The research points that small entrepreneurs in LDCs struggle to prepare themselves to search for investors, but investors seem to do little to be prepared to meet those firms.

Prior to the Bruns and Merchant (1990) study, the morality of short-term earnings management was of little concern to researchers and accounting practitioners. However, in the light of increased financial frauds and failures, new and increased emphasis has been placed on the importance of the concepts of earnings quality and earnings management practices. Despite increased research focusing on business ethics since 1990, there is little evidence that business schools and the profession are educating accountants about earnings management practices. Therefore, this study, similar to other studies, continues to use the Bruns and Merchant survey and compares the results of studies on students and business managers on earnings management practices. Students and business managers were surveyed at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) and these results were compared to four studies prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 in the US. The expectation will be of changes in attitudes towards earnings management since the financial scandals and passing the Act.

In developing the research question, the analysis may be divided on two levels: one deductive and the other inductive, which correspond to the two main sections of the chapter. The first section (1-2) presents the theoretical framework by way of recalling threads of study on entrepreneurship and on business ethics centred upon behaviour, motivations and business values. The analysis then concludes by presenting a review of the international studies on the theme of the relationship between managerial culture and territory. The second section (3-4) is developed by way of a qualitative research methodology centred upon the analysis of behavior towards CSR and sustainability of a sample of SMEs belonging to the Marche Region, Italian territory ""cradle"" of the small-sized company and craft traditions. Empirical evidence presented, highlights how best practices of socially-oriented Marche SMEs - who are excellent examples of ""convivial enterprises"" strongly rooted in their territories - contribute to a model of Territorial Social Responsibility (TSR) that progresses within the particular socio-economic context of the region. The ""social capital"", enriched by values, cultures and traditions tied to a specific community-space, synthesizes intangible factors that favour the development of CSR and the sustainability of SMEs. The economic model of ""gentle capitalism"" centred around ""territorial"" SMEs, which can be found in the business contexts under discussion, leans on the construction of a large consensus both within and external to the company, as well as on an environment which is neither restraint or limitation, rather it is an opportunity. The possible pathway of territorial CSR based on the culture of doing ""good"" in the local context, may offer a possible alternative to the often, unfortunately, short-sighted ""turbo-capitalism"" of the major transnational companies, which are not rooted in the area where they are located and ""nomadic"" in their character. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A review of 190 academic papers spanning the period from 1975 to mid-2009 was conducted. This exploratory study evaluated the associations and disassociations of the primary name assigned to this genre of investment with variables grouped into five domains, namely Primary Ethical Position, Investment Strategy, Publication Date, Regions Covered and Periodical Type. The study indicated that papers coded as expressing a deontological ethical position were more frequently associated with the name Ethical Investment, whereas those with an ambiguous ethical position were less frequently associated with Ethical Investment. Three investment strategies (positive screening, best-in-class and cause-based investing) were unusually associated with the primary name Responsible Investment. A strong preference for the name Ethical Investment was noted in the United Kingdom, and contrasted starkly with an apparent aversion for this name in the United States. The name Ethical Investment is significantly more frequently used in journals dealing with ethics, business ethics and philosophy than in finance, economic and investment journals. Finally, the study yielded some weak hints that the name Responsible Investment might perhaps be linked to an egoist ethical position. On the basis of this, and because these have already been substantively linked through the Principles for Responsible Investment in the popular discourse, we follow the heuristic tradition set by Sparkes (Business Ethics Eur Rev 10:194-201, 2001), and propose that Responsible Investment be defined as 'Investment practices that integrate a consideration of ESG issues with the primary purpose of delivering higher-risk-adjusted financial returns'. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Egoism; Ethical investment; Naming; Responsible investment; Socially responsible investment",

While neoclassical economic theory would suggest a pure economic rational basis for management decisions, the empirical study conducted by the authors put other concepts to a test, thereby analyzing their importance for managerial decision making: specific notions of fairness, reciprocal altruism, and commitment. After reviewing some of the theoretical literature dealing with such notions, the article shows the results of an online survey working with scenarios depicting ethical dilemma situations. By judging such scenarios the respondents showed their preference for the named concepts, though with different degrees of confirmation. The results (with all limitations of an online survey in mind) support the theoretical work on the named concepts: Fairness elements (including Rawlsian principles of justice and an understanding of fairness as conceived by a reference transaction) play a major part in management decisions in ethical dilemma situations. Also, commitment as a behaviour that sticks to rules even if personal welfare is negatively touched, and reciprocal altruism as a cooperative behaviour that expects a reciprocal beneficial action from other persons have been concepts used by Austrian managers when analyzing ethical dilemmas. The article also tries to put the results into a comparative perspective by taking into account other studies on ethical decision factors conducted with, e. g. medical doctors or journalists, and by discussing intercultural implications of business ethics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Commitment; Ethical dilemma situations; Fairness; Management decisions; Reciprocal altruism; Sen",

This radical application is needed as part of a process of developing agility. Agility will be required in the future when businesses need to make significant adaptations to the way that they operate. Such fundamental changes in operation will be driven by the complexities of the structural changes in the business environment directly linked with climate change and other problems (e.g. security of energy supplies).

Results suggest the rate of individual's network growth (perceptual and actual) depends on individual's CNFU. Research suggests consumers with high need for uniqueness may be both successful and unsuccessful in maintaining and attaining social relationships (Lynn & Harris, 1997; Snyder & Fromkin, 1980; Tian, Bearden, & Hunter, 2001). Unique individuals exhibit an exclusive appeal that elicits positive social evaluations (e.g. a person displaying a creative style of fashion such as a seven button suit). On the other hand, unique individuals may encounter social disapproval if they choose to be too extreme with their consumption choices (e.g., a person displaying an odd form of fashion such as an orange spandex suit). Despite these presumptions, there has been no direct attempt to explicitly investigate the social benefits and costs of being unique on the development of individuals' social network. While scholars have speculated on the social consequences of being unique (e.g., Snyder & Fromkin, 1980; Tian et al., 2001), we do not know the impact which unique consumers have on their friendship selection processes. In response, we explore an emerging social network (longitudinally) to investigate the effects of consumers' need for uniqueness (CNFU) on individuals' social network development. There are reasons to suggest that being unique in a network can have positive and negative consequences to individuals' social network development. For instance, being too unique can result in social sanctions (Ruvio, 2008). Consumers sometimes use products that deviate from social norm (Tian et al., 2001); breaking rules or challenging existing rules at the risk of social disapproval results in negative evaluations such as the perception of poor style (Tian et al., 2001). Thus, individuals may encounter negative social reactions and social disapproval which in turn constrains one's social network development (i.e., make less friends). Conversely, scholars have suggested that the desire for uniqueness is influenced by the individual's need for social assimilation and social approval (Ruvio, 2008). Here, uniqueness is sought only to the point where it precludes individuals from social isolation or strong disapproval (Snyder & Fromkin, 1980). In such cases, consumers may use distinctiveness as an opportunity to elicit positive social evaluations through making creative choices that enhance their personal style. That is, individuals distinguish themselves in the hopes of obtaining greater social rewards (Santee & Maslach, 1982). Thus, being unique is beneficial to one's social network development (i.e., make more friends). Given that the literature has identified that being unique has both positive and negative consequences for the consumer, our present research investigates the social benefits and costs of CNFU on individuals' social network development. Regrettably, research in this domain has a limited understanding of how CNFU influences networks. While previous research has implied numerous social outcomes for unique individuals (Ruvio, 2008; Tian et al., 2001), not much is known about how relationships are formed and maintained over time. For this reason, the current study is designed to explore the effects of CNFU on the dynamic transformation of individuals' social network. Specifically, we ask the following questions: how does CNFU positively or negatively affect the dynamic growth of individuals' social network? How does CNFU influence consumers' choice of friendships and their ability to attract friendships in an emerging social network? These research questions provide a guiding framework for our study. Findings from our longitudinal network research contribute to the extant literature in two distinct ways. Theoretically, we show that the extent to which individuals actively widen or condense their social network is dependent on whether they are creative with their identity or avoid peers that have similar identities. Further, the extent to which unique consumers are able to attract friendships is dependent on whether their unique display is within the confines of group norms. Furthermore, we find differences in how CNFU affects individual's perception of their social network vs. their actual network (as rated by others). These findings add to the current stock of knowledge and validate the important role of CNFU in consumer networks. Methodologically, this is one of the first longitudinal studies in consumer behavior to track the developmental patterns of an emerging social network. Using the latest social network method, the current research introduces an actor-based modelling technique (Snijde, van de Bunt, & Steglich, 2010; Snijders, Steglich, Schwinberger, & Huisman, 2007) to observe the unique effects of CNFU on individuals' social network development.",,

Much of existing studies have suggested that more interest should be placed on integrating the satisfaction construct into the larger body of inter-organizational social capital theory. In fact buyers (i.e.,business customers) and sellers are not atomistic entities free to undertake any competitive action within their own resource constraints. Rather, they are embedded in a network of social relationships that can influence their competitive behaviour, according to the idea that social embedded structures can shape the strategic action in business markets. Though a consensus exists regarding the importance of inter-organizational social networks for relationship satisfaction, there is no conclusive evidence on which social capital configurations are most beneficial to reinforce relationship satisfaction. By investigating seller-buyers relationships, we address the extent to which different dimensions of social capital - relational, structural and cognitive - can affect the customer's perceived relationship satisfaction, in the business-to-business setting of the Italian retail apparel industry. We assume that both strong social ties (i.e., relational and cognitive dimensions) and weak social ties (i.e., structural dimension) are positively related to customers' relationship satisfaction. As noted in the literature, in fact, the structure of relationships is not all that matters, yet the content of these relationships matters as well. The main empirical contributions of our work show, on the one hand, the positive impact of both structural and cognitive dimensions of inter-organizational social capital and, on the other hand, a non significant impact of the relational dimension on relationship satisfaction. Our findings help to address the need to detail and to test different approaches, that refer to inter-organizational satisfaction creation and to social capital, providing evidence of the importance of integrating such articulated constructs. The conceptual novelty of our approach resides in developing a framework where inter-organizational social capital is considered a proxy of relationship investments, with the aim to integrate network theory studies with a strategic analysis of a relationship marketing construct. While literature has highlighted the importance of relationship investments of any kind made by sellers on behalf of regular customers, we explicitly highlight that customers tend to be more committed and satisfied with sellers who actively make intangible investments toward them in terms of structural and cognitive efforts. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, it is also shown to be challenging to consistently obtain high quality inference. This challenge can be partially attributed to the fact that people usually maintain diverse social relationships, in order to tap into diverse information and knowledge. It is unlikely that a person would possess all interests of his/her social neighbors. Instead, s/he may selectively acquire just a subset of them. This paper intends to improve inferring interests from neighbors given this observation. We conduct this study by implementing a privacy-preserving large distributed social sensor system in a large global IT company to capture the multifaceted activities (e.g., emails, instant messaging, social bookmarking, etc.) of 25K+ people. These activities occupy the majority of employees' time, and thus, provide a higher quality view of the diverse aspects of their professional interests compared to the friending activity on online social networking sites. In this paper, we propose a technique that exploits the correlation among the attributes that a person possesses to improve social-correlation-based inference quality. Our technique offers two unique contributions. First, we demonstrate that the proposed technique can significantly improve inference quality by as much as 76.1%. Second, we study the interaction between the two factors: social correlation and attribute correlation under different situations. The results can inform practical applications how the inference quality would change in various scenarios. © 2011 ACM.","attribute correlation; inference; social correlation; user interest modeling","High quality; inference; Instant messaging; IT companies; Privacy preserving; Sensor systems; Social bookmarking; Social networking sites; Social relationships; User interests; Knowledge management; Professional aspects; Social networking (online); Correlation methods"

We argue that (1) CSR activities need to be managed and measured as projects and aggregated to the business or corporate level using a project portfolio; (2) appropriate measures need to be identified that move away from reporting the firm's activities toward quantifying actual social outcomes achieved; and (3) given the types of projects prevalent in CSR, statistical evaluation methods common in other fields (ideally, pre-test post-test control group designs, such as used in medicine or propensity score matching for ongoing or past projects) should be employed to properly measure outcomes. We make a first, albeit imperfect, attempt at using such an approach with data collected on behalf of the Patrimonio Hoy project, a well-publicized CSR initiative carried out by Cemex in Mexico. We show that the results from this data reinforce concerns voiced earlier in this article. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social performance; Impact evaluation; Measurement issues; Project management; Propensity score matching",

However, the vigorous opposition to freedom of association by US firms is largely ignored in the business ethics literature and exacerbated by compensatory corporate citizenship rating mechanisms that tend to mask labor rights deficiencies. I argue that because freedom of association is a hypernorm, instrumental to fully realizing basic human rights, labor rights and human rights are largely inseparable. Thus, respect for labor rights is a non-substitutable requisite of corporate citizenship. I conclude by providing examples of corporate labor relations strategies that respect freedom of association and business firms that are leading the way. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Corporate citizenship ratings; Freedom of association; Human rights; Hypernorms; Labor rights; Worker participation",

This paper identifies this as a serious weakness and argues that identifying the responsibility to respect human rights as an explicitly ethical obligation to be respected for that reason would provide a much stronger justificatory foundation for respecting the principle seen from a corporate perspective, given that corporations are accountable to their shareholders for their deployment of the firm's financial resources. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Business; Ethics; Globalization; Human rights; UN Framework",

Enterprises across the world are waking up to the need for social responsibility towards shareholders and potential investors, managers and other employees, customers, business partners and contractors or suppliers, the natural environment and the communities within which they operate, including national governments and non-governmental organizations. Drawing on case studies of international companies and analysis of research from the past two decades, The Planetary Bargain shows how corporations can preserve their profitability while treating all stakeholders ethically and responsibly.

I argue that leverage is a source of responsibility where there is a morally significant connection between the company and a rights-holder or rights-violator, the company is able to make a contribution to ameliorating the situation, it can do so at modest cost, and the threat to human rights is substantial. In such circumstances companies have a responsibility to exercise leverage even though they did nothing to contribute to the situation.

Methodology - Ethics theory is used to analyse the prevalent business practice of downsizing, drawing upon literature that examines downsizing and/or explains and demonstrates the application of ethical principles. Findings - Downsizing, as defined in this chapter, is an unethical and irresponsible business practice because it reduces utility, ignores rights, creates injustice, breaks social contracts, creates agency relationships where none exist and fails to respond to the legitimate claims that employees, as a stakeholder, make upon corporations. Practical implications - Change becomes necessary to the business practice of downsizing when it is carried out by profitable companies without proper appeal to ethics principles for justification. Ethical principles may, instead, suggest alternative courses of action or techniques. Social implications - Downsizing (and other forms of mass layoffs) is not a morally neutral activity, as it engenders significant social implications (i.e. harm) that necessitate ethical consideration. Moreover, when business actions have social consequences, the interests of other stakeholders may become legitimate. Value of the chapter - This chapter illustrates the formulation and application of principles that help guide business people to take morally right courses of action. It also serves as a template for analysing other aspects of the employment relationship for a more critical approach to corporate responsibility. As shown in this chapter, ethics can have more than a peripheral role in business decision making.

With the emergence of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) replacing the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), there is a need for policy and practice going forward to be clearly informed by a critique of TTO (Technology Transfer Office)RDA stakeholder relationship in a lessons learned approach so that LEPs can benefit from a faster learning curve. Thus, the aim of this paper is to examine the stakeholder relationship between three regional universities in the context of its TTO and the RDA with a view to determining lessons learned for the emerging LEP approach. Although the issues raised are contextual, the abstracted stakeholder conceptualisation of the TTORDA relationship should enable wider generalisation of the issues raised beyond the UK. Stakeholder theory relationship and stage development models are used to guide a repeat interview study of the TTO and RDA stakeholder groupings. The findings, interpreted using combined category and stage based stakeholder models, show how the longitudinal development of the TTORDA stakeholder relationship for each case has progressed through different stakeholder pathways, and stages where specific targeting of funding was dependant on the stakeholder stage. Greater targeted policy and funding, based on the stakeholder relationship approach, led to the development of joint mechanisms and a closer alignment of performance measures between the TTO and the RDA. However, over-reliance on the unitary nature of the TTORDA relationship may lead to a lack of cultivation and dependency for funding from other stakeholders. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It offers an innovative analysis that differentiates amongst our genuine ethical obligations to individuals, counterfeit obligations to identity groups, and complex role-based obligations in organised groups. It suggests that often individuals need intuitive moral judgment developed by experience, reflection and dialogue to identify the individual obligations that emerge for them in complex group situations. These situations include some where people have to discern what their organisations’ corporate social responsibilities imply for them as individuals, and other situations where individuals have to deal with conflicts amongst their obligations or with efforts by other people to exploit them.

The results reveal that the influencing factors for receipt of an environmental award are the presence of an environmental management system (EMS); stakeholder engagement; and disclosure on specific environmental activities (waste management, climate change risk, and climate change activities). The results also show that the level of environmental disclosure and the consequent possibility of receiving an award, are influenced by industry membership; the extent of environmental information disclosure are not the same in all industries.

One of the few attempts to offer a Humean theory of business ethics rests on this game-theoretic interpretation of Hume's argument. This article argues that game-theoretic reasoning is only one part of a Humean business ethics and this can be shown by further analyzing Hume's theory of justice. As we examine his theory, it becomes clear that Hume is not trying to show how it is always rational to respect the rules of business. Hume is not engaging in, or attempting, a reconciliation project and neither is a Humean business ethics.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a single case study of a regional producer of dairy products in Sweden. The data were collected from non-structured interviews with managers and available corporate documentation. Findings: The company's ""sustainable business cycle"" may be divided into nine stages beginning with the arable land through to the dairy and transportation of products to market, where the final two stages involve external retailers and consumers, all of which is important to fulfilment of the earlier seven internal stages. Research limitations/implications: The findings stress the importance of connecting and reconnecting not just to immediate environmental concerns of business, but also to planet Earth, which is under non-sustainable pressure and evidently faces an unpleasant destiny. Practical implications: The case highlights advantages and challenges facing a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) tasked with implementing a sustainable business cycle for a commodity product in a highly competitive market, dominated by powerful retailers. Social implications: Changing consumer behaviours and purchasing patterns, as well as state interventions imposed at top political levels worldwide, will gradually increase the necessity to create sustainable business cycles.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is used to provide a clearer insight into the phenomenon of stakeholder management in the context of destination marketing. This research uses a combination of three sources of evidence - interviews, documents and physical artefacts (in the sense of the actual web site) - and is based on the in-depth study of the case of the development of the official web site of Tourism New Zealand (www.purenz.com). Findings: This study shows that a wide variety of organizations and even the entire population of the country who are affected by destination marketing decisions should be recognized as destination stakeholders. Tourism New Zealand's leaders' understanding of cooperation and its value emerged as a major factor having an effect on the cooperation in the purenz development. The different objectives and perspectives of key stakeholders come through clearly in the case study which suggests that different approaches for managing the diverse stakeholders in the context of destination marketing are required. Practical implications: A key finding that cooperation is not uniform has several implications for national tourism organizations (NTOs) around the globe. Study shows that the expectations of a cooperative process in destination marketing differ from group to group. This provides a useful guidance for Indian NTOs and NTOs in other countries who are responsible for tourism-related policies in their country. The study makes the clear suggestion to Indian and global tourism practitioners and policy makers that management of various stakeholders in the context of destination marketing is not a given but a strategic choice which is affected by the existing network structure and climate. Originality/value: This research is based on the data from one of the world's popular tourism destinations - New Zealand - and therefore, provides very valuable and practical guidance for national tourism organizations around the globe. Besides being of immense value to global as well as Indian practitioners, this study opens an avenue for students and academics to determine if there are differences in the understanding and expectations of cooperation among stakeholders of other tourism networks and to investigate the implications of different expectations of cooperation on the balance of power issues in inter-organizational cooperation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Destination marketing; India; National tourism organizations; New Zealand; Stakeholder management; Stakeholders; Tourism",

Thomas's virtue theory coordinates private and public activities through a set of context-invariant, justice-oriented norms with conceptual appeal to contemporary questions of global business ethics. In our article, we first sketch how Aquinas's theory can be also of relevance to a non-confessional audience through its appeal to the 'natural light of reason.' Then we explain how his theory of 'natural law' aligns his ideas of virtue and justice. From this vantage point, we address the tension between cultural diversity and moral uniformity in the economic sphere in general and in today's globalized business world in particular.

Engaging with people and influencing the right behavior is a vital factor underpinning the successful deployment and lasting change. One of the key recommendations arising from the Sky Future Leaders Study put improved employee engagement right at the top of its Five Point Plan, in order to create a culture that thinks sustainably. Enabling people to change in support of beneficial business change was at the heart of Apollo Motor Group's radical shift towards a more sustainable business operation; in this case, very much focused on winning hearts and minds. The approach was also developed in recognition that the changing world of climate change can sound big and intimidating, and can consequently leave people with the feeling that they are unable to make a difference.",,"Business benefits; Business changes; Employee engagement; Sustainable business; Climate change; Sustainable development"

The acquisition of moral agency in business involves the recognition, refinement, and habituation through the processes of reflexion and reflection of a moral sense encapsulated in innate modules for compassion, hierarchy, reciprocity, purity, and affiliation adaptive for communal life both in ancestral and modern environments. The genetic and neural bases of morality exist independently of institutional frameworks and social structures. The latter not only shape moral behaviors within circumscribed limits, they also imply a plurality and compartmentalization of roles which may enable or impede the habituation of virtue.

I proceed in four steps. First, I explain MacIntyre's account of the virtues in light of his definition of a ""practice."" Second, I examine his distinction between ""practices"" and ""institutions."" Third, I explain what I mean by a ""domain-relative practice"" and defend the claim that it is helpful to conceive of management in those terms.

The paper is a literature review including definition, external drivers of propagation of CRM and the review of available results of empirical studies of CRM effectiveness. The main propositions of the paper: a) CRM is an effective tool for enhancing the company competitiveness; b) The rising popularity of CRM arises from the expectations of stakeholders; c) The factors of effectiveness of CRM can be defined. The propositions have been verified with the use of empirical data available in the literature. The data supports the propositions that CRM influences elements of competitiveness like brand image, customer loyalty and market results. The studies of stakeholders' expectations indicate that they exert pressure on companies to follow the principles of corporate social responsibility. The identified and empirically confirmed factors influencing the effectiveness of CRM include strategic fit between the focal company and their non-profit partner organization, duration of the campaign, product type and the gender of the target group.","Cause-related marketing; Corporate social responsibility; Marketing",

The purpose of this chapter is to analyse stakeholder attitudes and their antecedents in such a case. Because of its scope, magnitude and use of a response strategy based on messages of social responsibility, the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico serves as an excellent case for measuring the effectiveness of such a messaging strategy. Methodology/approach - The present study drew from two data sources: a content analysis of interactions on BP's Facebook page (N=1,515) as well as an image survey of BP (N=749). Findings - BP's messaging strategy had limited positive effects in terms of (1) being viewed as a 'socially responsible' organisation and (2) creating significant good will towards the company. However, these data also reveal that BP has effectively opened lines of communication between stakeholders and the company. Practical and social implications - This study has two central implications. First, for both organisations and activists, personal investment and the relevance of issues are both critical in order to change stakeholder attitudes about organisations. Second, based on this research, we can begin to develop stakeholder profiles based on age, sex and political identity. Originality/value - In the last couple of years, considerable attention has been paid to describing and analysing the response strategies that organisations deploy; however, scant attention has been paid to measuring stakeholder evaluations of those crisis response strategies.

The main goal of the system is to identify and filter the recently published valuable resources while taking into account the interactions and the relationships the user has within social structures. The interactions are logged and aggregated in order to determine the trust scores between users. Using the scores obtained, one can identify the types of relationship established between users; the scores will then be integrated into an adaptive global model used for recommending resources. Our approach presents several advantages over classic CF-based approaches and content-based recommendations regarding cold start, scalability and serendipitous recommendations.

We examine patterns of loneliness across adults aged 15 years and older in the United Kingdom using data from the European Social Survey. We first consider the prevalence of loneliness among the adult population; then the relationship between loneliness and a range of key risk factors, and finally the relationship with age for each of our risk factors. Loneliness demonstrates a nonlinear U-shaped distribution, with those aged under 25 years and those aged over 65 years demonstrating the highest levels of loneliness. Depression is associated with loneliness for all age groups. Poor physical health is associated with loneliness in young adult and midlife but not later life. For those in mid and later life, the quality of social engagement is protective against loneliness, while for young adults it is the quantity of social engagement. This indicates that different factors may endow vulnerability (or protect) against loneliness at different stages of life and suggests that preventative strategies or interventions that reflect these variations need to be developed.",,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; case report; cross-sectional study; depression; female; health survey; human; loneliness; male; middle aged; prevalence; psychological aspect; questionnaire; risk factor; sex difference; United Kingdom; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Great Britain; Health Surveys; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Young Adult"

There is often a gap between rhetoric and reality, with companies often accused of paying green lip service to sustainable SCM. This research aims to explore sustainable SCM issues in companies that have been recognized as leaders in their sectors, and investigate what factors influence sustainable SCM, and how practice might change in the future. Design/methodology/approach: Current practice in sustainable SCM and predictions for the future were explored in case studies of seven UK companies, through semi-structured interviews with purchasers and CSR practitioners, and secondary data collection from reports and websites. Sectors included aerospace, retail, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink. Findings: Companies were mapped onto a typology of approaches to sustainable SCM, based on internal and external enablers and barriers. Companies were classified as Internal focusers, Reserved players, External responders, and Agenda setters. Predictions for the future of sustainable SCM within the companies were also explored. Research limitations/implications: The typology could be further explored through a survey of firms from different sectors, and with firms not seen as leading in their field.

However, the economy has gradually created a huge rift between the ""haves"" and ""have-nots,"" because of which, the affairs of corporations are being minutely scrutinized. Since the corporations use the resources from within the society, their continued existence not only depends on the sustainability of these resources but also their acceptance of accountability for sustaining them. Currently, social responsibility activities by the compassionate companies are reported only on a voluntary basis.

The purpose of this study is to assess whether Australian companies have adjusted their footprint-related disclosure responses. Adopting a legitimacy perspective, a key aim is to assess whether pragmatic or moral legitimation approaches dominate by determining whether disclosure tends to be more reflective of symbolism or of apparent behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of the sustainability and annual reports of the ASX's Top 50 companies is undertaken to compare carbon footprint-related disclosures in 2008 and 2005. Their extent and nature (action or symbolism) and the use of attention-attracting devices are reported for the more carbon intensive and less carbon intensive sectors. Findings: Footprint-related disclosure rates are increasing, and disclosure is being signalled more prominently. However, while carbon-intensive sectors appear to be pursuing a moral legitimation strategy underpinned by substantive action, the less intensive sectors are relying more heavily on symbolic disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small and comprises only large listed Australian companies.

Further, incentives for the carbon-intensive sectors may be needed to encourage ongoing efforts to bridge the carbon chasm that is emerging.

Methodology/approach - The chapter reviews current literature highlighting the structural elements of corporate irresponsibility in the mining industry, arguing for a radical reconceptualization of governance in the mining industry based on four dimensions of responsibility and backed by a flexible and robust international legal framework. Research/practical implications - This chapter presents practical implications for improving policy for and regulation of mining companies, Canadian or otherwise, with international operations. While further research needs to be undertaken to explore in more detail the ideal roles of different actors in a system of international governance, this chapter provides a theoretical framework for integrating four dimensions of responsibility into a governance framework that can address the systemic dynamics of organized irresponsibility in the mining industry.

Although the Global Compact is often characterized as a promising way to address global governance gaps, it remains largely unclear why this is the case. To address this problem, we discuss to what extent the initiative represents an institutional solution to exercise global governance. We suggest that new governance modes, which have arisen in the context of globalization, often adopt a multiactor, multilevel, and network-based approach. We then analyze how far the Global Compact's institutional design reflects this multiactor, multilevel, and network-based steering mode. Drawing on this discussion, we offer suggestions regarding how the initiative can be further developed. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,

Up to a point, competition nurtures and supports such virtues as prudence, temperance, civility, industriousness and honesty. But there are also various mechanisms by which competition can have deleterious effects on the institutions and incentives necessary for sustaining even these most commercially friendly of virtues. It is often supposed that if competitive markets are good, more competition must always be better.

Malaysia is gearing towards becoming a major player in the world Halal market. Its Halal certification is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM). The process of awarding Halal certificates involves not only an official site inspection of production plants but also the examination on the Halal status of raw materials. In 2007, JAKIM only approved 75 percent of the total number of applications for Halal certification. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 547 small and medium-sized enterprise manufacturers in Malaysia represented the population for this study. SERVQUAL gap analysis was used to measure the gap between clients' expectations and their perceptions of JAKIM's services. Findings: The results of the analysis indicate that the biggest gap was in the empathy dimension, followed by responsiveness, reliability, assurance and tangibles. The results show that JAKIM had not met food manufacturers' expectations in all five service quality dimensions, especially the empathy dimension. Practical implications: Practical implications extend to food policy decision makers involved in JAKIM to develop and formulate appropriate strategies to meet the needs of its clients more effectively. Originality/value: JAKIM could design training programs by emphasizing on the issues of human factors in service delivery, in particular the requirements of customer care, work ethics and human relations skills.

Proactive CSR has been less researched in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) compared to large firms; and, whether SMEs are ideally placed to gain competitive advantage through such activity therefore remains a point of debate. This study examines empirically the association between three specified capabilities (shared vision, stakeholder management and strategic proactivity), proactive CSR and financial performance in SMEs. Using quantitative data collected from a sample of 171 SMEs in the machinery and equipment sector of the Australian manufacturing industry, we find that all specified capabilities are positively associated with adoption of proactive CSR by SMEs, and that proactive CSR is, in turn, associated with an improvement in firm financial performance. Evidence of a fully mediating role for proactive CSR on the association between capabilities and financial performance presented in this study aligns with RBV theory that suggests adoption of value-creating strategies that make the most effective use of a firm's capabilities is essential to financial success. The study contributes to the CSR literature by demonstrating a case for SMEs being able to maximise financial returns whilst proactively making progress towards CSR. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Capabilities; Financial performance; Proactive corporate social responsibility (CSR); Resource-based view (RBV); Small and medium enterprises (SMEs)",

We understand a great deal about organizational trust, but research generally assumes that all parties view trust in organizations the same way. Stakeholder trust – or, an analysis of differential stakeholder approaches to trust – has been relatively unexplored, with a few notable exceptions. Key questions What role can stakeholder theory play in understanding public trust in the institution of business? How do different stakeholders conceptualize organizational trust, and what impact do these differences have? What does a better understanding of stakeholder trust tell us about public trust in business? New knowledge Trust has at least two key components – trust that is based upon an assessment of integrity or goodwill and trust that is based on an assessment of competence. Competence-based trust may be a higher priority in certain stakeholder relationships, whereas in others goodwill-based trust may be more important. Recognizing and understanding which aspect of trust has priority in particular stakeholder relationships, and understanding how those stakeholders balance these two aspects of trust in their decisions, would be highly useful to business leaders. Key lessons At the individual level, trust in the institution of business and trust in a particular business are distinct concepts. Stakeholder roles (e.g., customer, employee, investor) differ qualitatively and engender different areas of emphasis when it comes to organizational trust; this has an important bearing on trust in business as an institution. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,

The three main arguments of the paper are as follows. First, classic CSR literature was more pluralistic in terms of background political theories than many later texts. Second, instrumental CSR adopted classical liberalism and libertarian laissez-faire as its structural logic. Third, new political CSR, based on a strong globalist transition of responsibilities and tasks from governments to companies, lacks a conceptualization of division of moral labor that is needed to fully depart from a classical liberalist position.

A closer integration of the two debates, as it argues, would allow for the formulation of an expansive and demanding conception of corporate human rights obligations. Such a conception does not stop with corporate obligations ""merely"" to respect human rights, but includes an extended focus on proactive company involvement in the protection and realization of human rights. In other words, the integration of the two debates provides the space within which to formulate positive human rights obligations for corporations. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Business and human rights; Corporate social responsibility; Human rights responsibility; Multinational corporations; UN framework",

Characterizing an MSI as consisting of numerous local networks that are embedded in a wider global network, I argue that tighter couplings (within local networks) and looser couplings (between local networks) coexist. Second, I suggest that this coexistence of couplings enables MSIs to generate policy outcomes which address the conditions of a transnational regulatory context. I argue that MSIs' way of organizing enables them to cope with three challenges: the stability, flexibility, and legitimacy of governance. Reflecting on these challenges, the article identifies a number of problems related to MSIs' role in transnational governance.

This conceptual paper examines the conditions of a legitimate transfer of regulatory power from traditional democratic nation-state processes to private regulatory schemes, such as MSIs. Democratic legitimacy is typically concerned with input legitimacy (rule credibility, or the extent to which the regulations are perceived as justified) and output legitimacy (rule effectiveness, or the extent to which the rules effectively solve the issues). In this study, we identify MSI input legitimacy criteria (inclusion, procedural fairness, consensual orientation, and transparency) and those of MSI output legitimacy (rule coverage, efficacy, and enforcement), and discuss their implications for MSI democratic legitimacy. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Corporate social responsibility; Deliberative democracy; Legitimacy; Multi-stakeholder initiative; Soft law",

Across three studies, effectiveness decreased negative perceptions and increased pro-organizational intentions via ethical judgment of the response. Moreover, the two dimensions interacted such that a response high in proximity but low in effectiveness led to more negative perceptions and to less pro-organizational intentions. This interaction was particularly pronounced if the corporation portrayed itself as communal-oriented. The interaction was mediated by individuals' ethical judgment, which was a function of the corporation's perceived benevolent concern. We termed the interaction the Strategic Samaritan, for it was when the corporation tried to appear like a Good Samaritan, displaying proximity with victims but not accompanying it with effective help, that it was seen as acting with less benevolent concern. © 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Corporate intentions; Corporate social responsibility; Crisis management; Disaster relief; Moral intensity",

A second camp vehemently counters that Aquinas's just price is simply the going market price. We argue that neither of these views is correct. The Thomistic just price is the price that would be agreed to by a just person as part of an exchange.

Such a price reduces neither to the cost-covering price nor to the market exchange price.

We should compare the chances of human rights fulfilment (and violations) that are likely to result from assigning human rights obligations to corporations with the chances of human rights fulfilment (and violations) that are likely to result from giving corporations the legal rights needed to undertake those human rights obligations. Corporations should respect basic human rights of all people. Non-complicity in human rights violations requires that corporations have the right to political freedom of speech. To actively protect people from human rights violations, corporations need the right to hire armed security personnel; such obligations should be limited to protecting corporate property and narrowly defined stakeholders. Obligations to spend corporate resources on human rights fulfilment are confined to contributing to specific projects.

This paper seeks to propose that the management theory of Peter F. Drucker and certain Aristotelian concepts, expressed in the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics, are applicable to the business community today. Design/methodology/approach: Drucker's management philosophy is synthesized with the moral philosophy of Aristotle to suggest a practical management framework for contemporary business practitioners. In providing a virtue-based moral framework for management grounded in a concern for character, communal well-being, and ultimate purpose, the paper argues that Drucker's Aristotelian style of business management provides a viable, virtue-based management theory that contemporary managers should be able to embrace. Findings: Drucker has been regarded as one of the most influential management thinkers of the twentieth century. The author suggests that, given the current level of morality shown in the behaviour of business people today - business leaders in particular - what is needed is a change in managerial perspective. A change from the prevailing concern with one's own well-being - how much one has, or can get for one's self - to include a concern for the well-being of others. The author proposes that Drucker's management philosophy, which reflects Aristotelian matters of character, community and telos, though formulated many years ago, provides a framework for improving managerial behaviour today. Research limitations/implications: Drucker's pragmatic business commentary and advice reveal a deep understanding of the complexity of the business world and the realities of business from the perspective of the business person, and yet does not reject the over-riding moral principles of integrity, community and achievement that serve as the foundation for society.

Given the adverse effects of materialism on society in general and on young consumers in particular, the purpose of this research is to gain a better understanding of youth materialism in Egypt along with parental influence in the transmission of materialistic values and hence building up recommendations and programs for impeding this phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical investigation was conducted through pursuing a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods. A deeper understanding of the problem at hand was generated by the qualitative research through conducting in-depth interviews with children, parents and educators; where the broader target was reached as well as a more comprehensive view was attained by quantitative research through self-administered surveys for parents and children. Findings: The results showed a positive correlation between parental materialism and child materialism. Concerning the relationships between family communication patterns, parental mediation practices and child materialism, the results indicated that indirect mediation was the strongest predictor for child materialism followed by restrictive mediation, while active mediation was not found as a significant predictor for child materialism. Research limitations/implications: The purpose of this research is tri-divided and limited to the following goals: first, capturing cultural differences for the manifestation of materialism in the Egyptian context. Second, examining the extent to which parents contribute and influence the transmission of materialistic values among young consumers. Third, proposing parents as a potential countervailing power against excessive youth materialism. Practical implications: The results of the study show that necessary steps should be taken by designing programs that involve parents as a potential countervailing power against excessive youth materialism. The results also showed a positive relationship between parents and child materialism. Furthermore, the results from the qualitative research indicated that parents are not really aware of the adverse effects materialism can have on their children. Moreover, the results indicated that there is a positive correlation between socio-oriented communication and restrictive mediation. At the same time and in line with the proposed conceptual model of the current research, restrictive mediation was found to be the second largest contributor to childhood materialism. Social implications: It is suggested that greater transparency about the consequences of materialism could work in favor of altering materialism (Abela). Hence, parents should be aware that excess youth materialism, as previously discussed in the literature, is associated with poor school performance, poor ethical behavior, shoplifting tendencies, unhealthy food consumption, and greater levels of life dissatisfaction. Originality/value: The research is unique in that it sets the ground for research in the critical area of young consumers in an important emerging market; Egypt. In addition, the novel interdisciplinary approach also contributes to the international literature in terms of both conceptualization and findings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertisements and promotions to Muslims; Consumer behaviour; Egypt; Islamic business ethics; Islamization of commerce; The Muslim consumer",

Much less attention has been given to examining variations in loneliness across age groups. We examine patterns of loneliness across adults aged 15 years and older in the United Kingdom using data from the European Social Survey. We first consider the prevalence of loneliness among the adult population; then the relationship between loneliness and a range of key risk factors, and finally the relationship with age for each of our risk factors. Loneliness demonstrates a nonlinear U-shaped distribution, with those aged under 25 years and those aged over 65 years demonstrating the highest levels of loneliness. Depression is associated with loneliness for all age groups. Poor physical health is associated with loneliness in young adult and midlife but not later life. For those in mid and later life, the quality of social engagement is protective against loneliness, while for young adults it is the quantity of social engagement. This indicates that different factors may endow vulnerability (or protect) against loneliness at different stages of life and suggests that preventative strategies or interventions that reflect these variations need to be developed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","age; gender; loneliness; older people; United Kingdom",

Well-publicized ethical problems such as the Challenger disaster, the Ford Pinto case and the collapse of corporations such as Enron have highlighted the need to rethink the role of ethics in the workplace. The concept of applied ethics originated in medicine with a groundbreaking book published in 1979. Business ethics books began to appear in the 1980s, with engineering ethics following in the 1990s. This volume now opens up a new area of applied ethics, comprehensively addressing the ethical issues confronting the civil aviation industry. Aviation is unique in two major ways: firstly it has a long history of government regulations, and secondly its primary focus is the safety of its passengers and crew. For decades commercial aviation was viewed in the same manner as public utilities, and thus it was highly regulated by the government. Since the Deregulation Act of 1978, aviation has been viewed as any other business while other experts continue to believe that the sudden switch to deregulation has caused problems, especially since many airlines were unprepared for the change. Ethical Issues in Aviation focuses on current concerns and trends, to reflect the changes that have occurred in this deregulated era. The book provides the reader with an overview of the major themes in civil aviation ethics. It begins with theoretical frameworks, followed by sections on the business side of aviation, employee responsibility, diversity in aviation, ground issues regarding airports, air traffic control and security, as well as health and the environment. The contributors to the volume include both academics doing research in the field as well as professionals who provide accounts of the ethical situations that arise in the workplace. Ethical Issues in Aviation is primarily intended for undergraduate and graduate students studying aviation, especially those seeking degrees in aviation administration, flight training, aircraft maintenance, and air traffic control. It is also applicable to many professionals working within the industry. © Elizabeth A. Hoppe 2011. All rights reserved.",,

For this purpose, a proposed CEQ construct has been applied. It appears from the empirical findings that while Australia, Canada and the United States are extremely similar in their economic and social development, there may well be distinct cultural mores and issues that are forming their business ethics practices. A research implication derived from the performed research is that the construct provides a selection of observable and measurable elements in the context of CEQ. The construct of CEQ consists of nine measures divided into two dimensions (i.e. staff support and regulation). They should not be seen as a complete list. On the contrary, it is encouraged that others propose and elaborate revisions and extensions. A practical implication of this paper is a structure of what and how to examine the CEQ in a managerial setting. It may assist companies in their efforts to establish, maintain and improve their ethical culture, norms and beliefs within the organization and supporting them in their ethical business practices with different stakeholders in the marketplace and society. The dimensions and measures of the construct may be used as a frame of reference for further research. They may be useful and applicable across contexts and over time using similar samples when it comes to large companies, as small- or medium-sized ones may not have considered all areas nor have the elements in place.

Firms and consumers are aware of the fact that they cause environmental pollution, depletion of resources and are responsible for the dangers involved. At the same time awareness is growing that they need to and will develop the appropriate solutions in the time to come. The idea that sustainable, cyclic businesses are more logical than consumption-oriented and waste-dumping ones seems fascinating to a growing number of people. For this change to happen new thinking and behavior is needed.Firms and consumers play a central role in a sustainable business. Companies deliver what consumers buy and vice versa. In a sustainable paradigm, companies are able to develop and produce sustainably. Therefore, companies need new management concepts for sustainable investment, manufacturing, logistics and marketing and for sustainable management.In Managing Environmentally Sustainable Innovation Bossink evaluates the innovation chain in a process of five consecutive stages, articulates five levels at which people collectively manage the chain, and analyzes the interplay between the two.

The crisis in the financial industry, precipitated by the bursting of a bubble in the housing sector, brought the U.S. economy to the brink of a major depression. Government officials, economists and financial executives intervened to implement measures to mitigate the damage, applying their expertise and using their best judgments to rescue the economy. The actions they took required technical competence, pragmatic judgments and controversial decisions. They worked through a crisis to try to prevent a very bad situation from becoming a catastrophe. As events played out in the autumn of 2008, there was little time to reflect on how immoral conduct contributed to the crisis and how financial recovery needs to be built on an ethical foundation.

Moreover, given the importance of ethics and morality in the current environment, it takes an ex-ante analysis followed by an ex-post analysis, to highlight ethical and efficient connection between the multitude of areas on which acts, as well as to show how these principles have emerged and developed. The failure of complying the moral principles and norms of the contemporary world, led to the idea of chaos and lack of provision in the economic plan. Therefore, our approach on the connection between business, ethics, morality, professionalism and accountability is appropriate. Among the objectives of accounting and morality in business is a serious interdependence. Lack of ethical and moral principles in accounting would create preconditions to achieve some ""legal fraud"", not necessarily related to creativity, but rather to the weakness of an accounting system without rules and ethical principles, reducing the quality of financial information.

However an important new perspective is now emerging that rejects the individualistic view and focuses on the reality that human life is essentially social, and that who we are is an inherently social phenomenon. It is the tribus, the many little groups we belong to, that are fundamental to our experience of life. Tribal Marketing shows that it is not individual consumption of products that defines our lives but rather that this activity actually facilitates meaningful social relationships. The social ‘links’ (social relationships) are more important than the things (brands etc.)The aim of this book is therefore to offer a systematic overview of the area that has been defined as “cultures of consumption”- consumption microcultures, brand cultures, brand tribes, and brand communities.

The primary goal of this work is to use a social relationship framework to study differences in consumers' responses to interactional fairness as revealed by their evaluations of a brand. Two types of relationships are examined-exchange relationships in which benefits are given to get something back in return; and communal relationships in which benefits are given to take care of others' needs. Results of two studies suggest that the type of consumers' relationship with the brand moderates the effect of interactional fairness such that consumers who have a communal relationship are more responsive to interactional fairness under conditions of low distributive fairness while those who have an exchange relationship are more responsive under conditions of high distributive fairness. © 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Brand relationships; Communal; Distributional fairness; Exchange; Interactional fairness; Justice",

The article develops a conceptual framework based on Bourdieu's theory of practice and its feminist developments. We discuss caring as gendered, habitual and emotional work and as a lived social relationship that produces different states of autonomy and dependency for women and men. Our study finds that women in particular face contradictory expectations of being intensely involved in emotion work on the one hand and in the efficient performance of tasks on the other, which creates a clash between their habitus and the field of care work. We further suggest that the clash produces social suffering that is difficult to recognize because the practices in the field reproduce and reaffirm the differences in the emotional habitus of men and women. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agency; Care; Emotions; Gender; Habitus","conceptual framework; gender issue; health care; health worker; neoliberalism; public sector; social work"

In doing so, this analsysis identifies how many corporations enter the political realm in one of three-seemingly contradictory-relationships between corporations and citizenship: corporations as if they were citizens; corporations as governments in relation to human citizenship; or corporations as arenas in which humans can play out their citizenship.

Thus, CSR reflects the failure of its advocates to understand the proper role of business in society, i.e. to make longterm financial gain for the owners through provision of a good or service. Within this perspective, conventional CSR is deemed irresponsible because it encourages employees and managers to divert owner funds towards socially responsible behaviours and actions and, as such, CSR is unethical and impedes 'realist business ethics'.

To examine the current state of business ethics in Israel, the study examines the following: (1) the extent of business ethics education in Israel; (2) the existence of formal corporate ethics program elements based on an annual survey of over 50 large Israeli corporations conducted over 5 years (2006-2010); and (3) perceptions of the state of business ethics based on interviews conducted with 22 senior Israeli corporate executives. In general, and particularly as a young country, Israel might be considered to have made great improvements in the state of business ethics over the years. In terms of business ethics education, the vast majority of universities and colleges offer at least an elective course in business ethics. In terms of formal business ethics program elements, many large companies now have a code of ethics, and over time continue to add additional elements. Most respondents believed they worked in ethical firms. Despite these developments, however, there appears to be significant room for improvement, particularly in terms of issues like: nepotism/favoritism; discrimination; confidentiality; treatment of customers; advertising; competitive intelligence; whistle-blowing; worker health and safety; and the protection of the environment. When compared with the U. S. or Europe, most believed that Israeli firms and their agents were not as ethical in business. A number of reasons were suggested that might be affecting the state of business ethics in Israel. A series of recommendations were also provided on how firms can better encourage an ethical corporate culture. The paper concludes with its limitations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics education; Business ethics organizations; Corporate ethics programs; Cross-cultural management; Israel; Perceptions of ethical behavior",

Does an adhesion to the philosophy and to the practices of CSR, which are reflected in a firm's mission and accountability, positively influences its governance? If so, is this influence more or less significant for SMEs with respect to large-sized firms? This paper winds itself around these questions and describes the principle findings that have emerged from a qualitative investigation focused on a selected group of ""cohesive"" Italian SMEs, in which their management complies with both economic and social issues. The empirical study finds that the diffusion of CSR is tied above all to the entrepreneur's values and orientation and to the company embeddedness to the local socio-economic environment. The concluding reflections trace the features of a territorial model of socially responsible orientation centered on the best practices of SMEs who are excellent examples of ""spirited businesses"" and are part of a network (which includes institutions, trade associations, non-profit organizations, etc.) that contributes to the diffusion of an orientation towards CSR and to sustainability across the territory. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Business ethics; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Small and medium enterprises; Territory",

We identify four key assumptions in the decision making literature and illustrate how these assumptions affect decision making theory, research, and practice within the purview of business ethics. Given the breadth of disciplines and approaches within management decision making scholarship, a content analysis of management decision making scholarship produces a greater range of assumptions with finer granularity than similar scholarship within business ethics. By identifying the core assumptions within decision making scholarship, we start a conversation about why, how, and to what effect we make assumptions about decision making in business ethics theory, research, and practice.

Students submit a written description for each incident, drawing from moral philosophical frameworks and/or other ethical concepts to label the issue as one that either exemplifies a ""best practice"" or ""raises concern."" For ""best practice"" examples, students consider the implications of the practice on the organization and its stakeholders and whether and how the practice could be improved. For examples that ""raise concern,"" students explain what the ethically appropriate action would be, indicate whether they would take that action, report any reservations they have about taking that right action, and consider how to behave ethically in a way that would bring about desired outcomes without incurring negative outcomes.

The article argues that the current fragmented/functional approach to sustainability and the conceptualisation of the supply chain as a bounded unidirectional flow of value does not provide the holistic approach that is required to meet the sustainability needs of tomorrow's business. A value cycle paradigm that facilitates the development of a multi-disciplinary research approach is developed and used to examine the extant literature for the principal issues that will need to be addressed. Future research concerned with developing environmentally sustainable business models must focus on the identification and management of the information flows at the interfaces between the customer, marketing, design, operations, logistics and external agents in the supply network. New networks required to support more sustainable forms of consumption will necessitate a fundamental reassessment of how and where value is added, consumed and recovered. In contemporary businesses, environmental sustainability is becoming a strategically important objective requiring holistic multi-disciplinary approaches. The extent to which the sustainability agenda extends conventional business models is demonstrated providing insights into areas of the value cycle that require further research. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Environmental sustainability; Information flows; Supply chain management; Value cycle","Business models; Environmental sustainability; External agents; Holistic approach; Information flows; Multi-disciplinary approach; Multi-disciplinary research; Research agenda; Supply networks; Sustainable business; Unidirectional flow; Value cycle; Environmental management; Industrial research; Information management; Supply chain management; Sustainable development"

Good corporate citizenship constitutes an important independent 'intangible' node within decision-making networks, framing relationships with influential external parties such as accountants. This discussion is limited by its inability to independently verify self-reported claims of compliance, or measure key indicators such as performance differences between compliant and non-compliant firms due to access restrictions on audit data.

While most museum income streams are not found to be particularly vulnerable to economic fluctuation, structural challenges for the financial management of museums do exist beyond economic crises.

Since then an impressive body of empirical data and theory-building has been amassed, mainly located in the fields of management studies and business ethics. One of the most noteworthy recent conceptual contributions to the scholarship is Midttun's (Corporate Governance 5(3):159-174, 2005) CSR-oriented embedded relational model of societal governance. It re-conceptualises the relationships between the state, business, and civil society. Other scholars (In Albareda et al.

To develop a stronger analytical framework with which to explore CSR, this article draws more deeply on political science literature concerned with governance and public policy analysis.

By means of a thorough case study investigation of highly ideology-focused food retailer Eataly, the paper aims to enrich existing theory on retailer branding. The various elements of Eataly's brand have been studied in order to identify how they enact the ideology for which the retailer stands. This topic is particularly relevant in a context where consumers appear increasingly committed to social responsibility and business ethics. So the final goal of the paper is to identify ideology-focused brand choices that lead to a preference towards the retailer. Design/methodology/approach: In order to address this paper's research aim, a well known framework developed by Esbjerg and Bech-Larsen is adopted to conceptualize the retail brand. Case study methodology is applied. Findings: This paper provides both research-related and practical contributions. From a research perspective, it provides empirical evidence on the role of ideology in large-scale food retailing, a field which has been traditionally neglected in the ideology debate. From a practical perspective, it provides a contribution to retailers and brand managers. Three main lessons can be mentioned. First, a company's ideology should be pervasively applied to each aspect of a brand and it seems to be primarily situated within tangible and physical attributes, rather than within symbolic features, at least in the case investigated. Second, an explicit ideology is not exempt from risks. Third, ideology can be subject to multiple interpretations that may give rise to unintended consequences. Research limitations/implications: This study tries to attenuate the reliability issues that are inherent in qualitative research by interviewing multiple informants with different positions inside the company. Triangulation using different types of data sources and systematic data analysis was also employed. Originality/value: The paper raises the importance of ideology in large-scale food retailing. It adopts the Esbjerg and Bech-Larsen framework and introduces the dimension of ideology as a lens through which each aspect of a brand can be interpreted. Moreover, it suggests that a brand's functional attributes play more of a leading role in transmitting ideology than symbolic features, which is somewhat counterintuitive. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand management; Branding; Food products; Ideology; Italy; Retailers",

This question will always prove contentious. First, the impacts differ according to context. Second, the social consequences and spillover effects of knowledge diffusion and technology-sharing may be limited and hard to measure. Third, contributions to enhancing social responsibility and improving living standards in host countries are delayed in effect, causally complex, and also hard to measure. Outcomes often critically depend on collaboration of governments, international institutions, the business world, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Research in this area is challenging and requires interdisciplinary collaboration between economists, financial experts, sociologists, ethicists, and other specialists. This paper explores: (1) the evidence to support the proposition that FDI and international business improve social conditions in less-developed countries, and: (2) how these improvements are linked to strategies of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ethical business practice. The paper draws insights from development, FDI, poverty alleviation, and bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) literature. Applications are demonstrated using examples from poverty-stricken areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper attempts not only to argue theoretically but also to provide practical evidence. The approach is simultaneously descriptive, analytical, and prescriptive in order to address a wide audience. It also highlights issues and trends for further academic research and presents the viewpoint that some limitations lie in the nature of ethics frameworks widely referenced in business and that these often fail to consider the compatibility of ethical constructs with relevant incentives. In this vein, we explore the application of Homann's framework for advantage and incentive-based ethics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bottom of the pyramid; Corporate responsibility; Foreign direct investment; Lecturing business ethics; Sub-Saharan Africa; Transition economies",

Audits offer a tool through which to shape and regulate corporate social performance (CSP). Where audits have limited value is in their ability to stimulate internal engagement around social and organizational norms and principles, as the process relies on auditors to generate performance data against pre-selected indicators. Data is then utilized to produce a measure of risk or effectiveness through which to demonstrate compliance. Focusing on the internal organizational aspects of accountability and the processes, mechanisms and methodologies used to establish critical reflection, three alternatives within the current audit regime are presented. These forms of 'new accounting' stand in contrast to conventional auditing, as their focus is on building cross-functional connections and collaborative internal relationships that are based on dialogue and mutual exchange about the problems and possibilities of CSR implementation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this approach is inappropriate since concrete action and experience in engineering contexts seldom meets the criteria of our traditional moral theories. Technological action is often distributed rather than individual or collective, we lack full control of the technology and its consequences, and we lack knowledge and are uncertain about these consequences. In this paper, I analyse these problems by employing Kierkegaardian notions of tragedy and moral responsibility in order to account for experiences of the tragic in technological action. I argue that ascription of responsibility in engineering contexts should be sensitive to personal experiences of lack of control, uncertainty, role conflicts, social dependence, and tragic choice. I conclude that this does not justify evading individual and corporate responsibility, but inspires practices of responsibility ascription that are less 'harsh' on those directly involved in technological action, that listen to their personal experiences, and that encourage them to gain more knowledge about what they are doing. © 2010 The Author(s).","Deepwater Horizon; Engineering; Kierkegaard; Moral responsibility; Technology; Tragedy","article; business ethics; decision making; disaster; engineering; ethics; human; morality; oil spill; professional standard; social behavior; technology; uncertainty; Choice Behavior; Disasters; Engineering; Ethics, Business; Humans; Moral Obligations; Petroleum Pollution; Professional Role; Social Behavior; Technology; Uncertainty"

Corporations in fulfilling their CR are anticipated to function within the framework of the laws and regulations as part of the legal responsibility. Having a good law that upholds human rights has been seen as a vital tool in promoting and improving the public image of a corporation in the eyes of their customers. In the area of consumer protection and contract law, the Malaysian contract law has not been a great champion of consumer rights vis-à-vis suppliers and manufacturers. Standard form contracts have come to dominate more than just routine transactions between suppliers and consumers. The increasing use of exemption clauses in consumer standard form contracts has now become a predominant feature of many consumer contracts. In view of increasing unethical conduct by manufacturers, consumer rights vis-à-vis manufacturers have also been a cause for concern. The absence of a contractual relationship between manufacturers and consumers has to an extent provided a good defence for escaping liability for defective goods by the manufacturers. The consumer rights, being the rights of third parties, have never been acknowledged under the Malaysian law of contract. Adopting the content analysis method, this paper aims at exploring CR vis-à-vis consumers in three selected areas of consumer and contract law, namely, the use of standard form contracts in consumer contracts, the exemption of liabilities for defective goods by traders and the rights of consumers against manufacturers under the Malaysian contract and consumer law regime. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Consumer protection law; Contract law; Corporate responsibility; Exemption clause; Standard form contract; Third party rights",

Here, it is argued that integrity is a useful virtue and that a more integrity-friendly environment in companies would be beneficial by stimulating the empowered employee to make improved contributions. The concept is central for business ethics and crucial for the company's choice of such policies. A priority of integrity also affects organizational theory and the practical organizing of the company.

Using the concept of corporate social responsibility orientation (CSRO), the study contrasts the perceptions of major stakeholders and examines adaptation of mining companies' CSRO to local context. It reveals that the CSRO of mining managers in Argentina differs from CSRO developed by global headquarters; and in Argentina companies ""negotiate"" economic, environmental and legal dimensions of CSR with the government. Although companies ""negotiate"" philanthropic responsibilities with the communities, ethical responsibilities are defined by the headquarters and not negotiated locally.

Results show that, where co-operative businesses achieve efficiencies through economies of scale, knowledge and skills transfer, sharing of risks and other means, this can also lead to coincidental reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that may not be achieved if investor-owned activity prevails.

Design/methodology/approach: A preliminary case study of an Irish NPO/public sector hybrid organisation was used to ground a review of NPO and public sector performance management concepts and theoretical developments. The review focused on the implications of organisational characteristics/attributes of the hybrid case study organisation for performance management. Findings: Five organisational characteristics/attributes are identified as central to the understanding of the challenges for performance management in such settings: inter-stakeholder relationships; tensions across priority objectives; culture and institutional clashes; power distribution; and interdependent stress. Further, it is suggested that while the adoption of collaborative public sector models suggests a move toward performance governance, the performance challenges identified in the hybrid setting give rise to particular barriers to any substantive movement in that direction.

Viewing CR as the accumulated trust and positive evaluations of the stakeholders, this paper proposes a conceptual and normative framework for Reputation Continuity, which enhances the ability of organizations to preserve their reputation, instead of working for its recovery in the post-crisis period. In our approach, we propose a process of maintaining trusted links, instead of restoring them and establishing a reputation resilient organization, instead of one struggling to recover from reputation losses, after the crisis has emerged. Working closely with stakeholders during the crisis, injecting a sense of normality continuity through effective leadership and mitigating image problems are seen as critical concerns, alongside a set of managerial practices to be followed. Ultimately, it is argued that, the value-based and strategically integrated view of Business Continuity must be enhanced and supported by Reputation Continuity activities. © 2012 The Clute Institute.","Business continuity; Business ethics; Corporate reputation; Crisis communications; Organizational crises; Reputation continuity; Supply chain crises",

This paper seeks to describe Balanced Experiential Inquiry (BEI), a learning activity designed to help managers develop sustained moral performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using their past experiences for reflective learning, managers engage in BEI to understand what promotes and curtails their ability to respond to ethical issues. Findings: A field study showed that managers engaging in BEI perceived less need for praise from others and experienced a reduction in negative emotions. Research limitations/implications: Future research evaluating BEI should use a control group, diverse sample, and a longitudinal design that tracks outcomes over time. Practical implications: Application of BEI is a promising mechanism to help organizations bolster managers' internal desires to stay on an ethical decision-making path.

Compliance disclosure is a relatively recent regulatory technique whereby companies are obliged to disclose the extent to which they comply with codes, 'best practice standards' or other extra-legal texts containing norms or prospective norms. Such 'compliance disclosure' obligations are often presented as flexible regulatory alternatives to substantive, command-and-control regulation. However, based on a report on experiences of existing compliance disclosure obligations, this article will identify major weaknesses that prevent them from becoming effective mechanisms to discipline a certain type of behaviour. It will be argued that regulatory recourse to compliance disclosure obligations is nonetheless worthwhile if we view them as mechanisms that can initiate a dialogue about norm interpretation, application and norm desirability. From this perspective, compliance disclosure obligations serve less to discipline companies by making corporate practices transparent, and more to trigger a process of norm development, in which the law, companies and their stakeholders interact. This article provides an illustration of how mandatory disclosure, if it is restricted to a unilateral communication process, may produce no effective results (or even prove counterproductive), whilst highlighting the alternative potential of disclosure as an initiator of dialogue, supported by laws, geared towards the development and refinement of norms applicable to business in a global context and the values they promote. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Compliance; Disclosure; Globalization; Norms; Transparency",

It seems more appropriate to understand the firm as a human community, a concept which can be found in several sources, including managerial literature, business ethics scholars, and Catholic Social Teaching. In addition, there are also philosophical grounds that support the idea of business as a human community. Extending this concept, and drawing from some Phenomenological-Personalist philosophers, we propose that the firm should be seen as a particular ""community of persons"" oriented to providing goods and services efficiently and profitably. Being a ""community of persons"" emphasizes both individuals and the whole, and makes explicit the uniqueness, conscience, free will, dignity, and openness to human flourishing. This requires appropriate communication about and participation in matters which affect people's life, and makes it essential to cooperate for the common good of the business firm and the society. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aristotle; Business as a community; Business enterprise; Business ethos; Catholic Social Teaching; Corporation; Firm; Personalism",

Businesses and managers are increasingly considering ways to incorporate a balance among economic, ecological, social, and cultural value creation into their business models. At the same time, the world is becoming exponentially more complex. Indeed, complexity theory and thinking are now apparent in academic and practice accounts of sustainability in business, as scholars and practitioners recognize the limitations of traditional reductionist approaches to systemic problems. To date, however, a more theoretical framing of sustainability lags behind accumulating practical evidence. The purpose of this article is to address this gap by developing a complexity-based framework for understanding and managing sustainability in complex adaptive systems. We aim for simplicity, wholeness, and practicality in our approach, taking a qualitative rather than quantitative perspective on complex systems. Using several contemporary case examples, the article describes the important qualities of complex systems and develops them into a working framework that integrates principles and parameters of sustainability.

We extend the scope of social responsibility beyond business corporations to include a range of institutions. We also propose that CSRs be reconceptualized in terms of the ways that managers enable stakeholders to hold themselves and each other responsible for the ways their actions affect each other as they conduct business through the firm. In this article, we propose a new view of corporations and responsibility that reconstrues behavior currently referred to as CSR. Starting with an overview of theories of the firm, we show that the way in which a firm is conceived yields different views on CSR. A shortcoming of the theory of the firm approach to CSR is that it leads us to focus excessively on business corporations at the expense of a broader analysis of other institutional players. These theories also tend to emphasize the obligations of corporations to people rather than of people to each other. We propose that social responsibility be viewed through a systems theory paradigm instead. We then argue that corporations should be construed in terms of the people who impact them.

We add to this growing stream of research by investigating how MNEs' social conduct in their emerging economy subsidiaries relates to their relationships with certain local stakeholders in the respective countries. Using stakeholder theory and the concept of local legitimacy, we argue that employees and the local governments are among the forces that drive firms to push for high standards in their working conditions and to engage in developing the local community. Further, we hypothesize that such efforts positively affect the performance of the subsidiary's employees and its relationship with local authorities. To test our hypotheses, we conduct a large-scale, cross-industry analysis using data from 213 MNE subsidiaries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that MNEs' local mid-level employees drive corporate social efforts and also positively react to the corporate social engagement of their employer.

Design/methodology/ approach - This study uses a mail survey and employs structural equation modeling to test the different relationships among the constructs examined. By testing the fitness of the competing model models, the appropriate relationships are identified. Findings - The environmental performance is directly influenced by instrumental motives and political motives, which have indirect effects on environmental performance through corporate environmental responsibility. These also reveal that instrumental motives have marginal effects on both corporate environmental responsibility and environmental performance, and the marginal effects of political motives on environmental performance are also clearly shown. Notably, the results reveal that the corporate environmental responsibly is a pivot in these cause-effect relationships. Research limitations/ implications - Although this study provides researchers and policy makers with a framework to study environmental responsibility in different business environments, it did not undertake a deeper analysis to better understand business and organizational cultures and business environments regarding the implementation of an environmentally oriented policy. Furthermore, the model was only tested with survey data from Taiwan, although some of samples operate internationally. Practical implications - From the perspective of a practical business context, practitioners should implement corporate responsibility policies that are specifically related to their political environments. For example, when doing businesses in Taiwan, the political motives involved in environmental protection will be the key to success when undertaking policies related to corporate environmental responsibility.

The global nature of environmental risks makes the assumption and practice of environmental responsibility difficult. This paper aims to examine the nature of this difficulty, arguing that although environmental responsibility remains global, it is situated and practiced at the local level. Design/methodology/approach: Using a case study methodology, the paper examines three family dairy farms in Belsize, New South Wales, Australia. Repeated interviews with adult members of the farming families explored their perspectives of the past, present and future of the farm, eliciting rich narratives about relationships between farm, environment, community and individual, and the role that responsibility plays in negotiating these relationships. Findings: Environmental responsibility is established as multi-faceted, and negotiated between social actors as one of myriad other, competing responsibilities. Responsibility is positioned as a critical factor in the generation and maintenance of social relationships, but one which is often mobilized as a mechanism of governance. The paper argues that this can result in tension for some social actors. Originality/value: This paper positions responsibility generally, and environmental responsibility in particular, as situated on the junction between local and global networks. This occurs as a result of the intrusion of the global into the local, and the corresponding need for individuals to act on the global stage through the medium of their local contexts. In managing the changes in behavior and identity necessary to do this successfully, responsibility is identified as one means of establishing social identity and group members, and a way of defining specific social roles. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Dairy products; Environmental management; Environmental responsibility; Farming; Local and global responsibilities; Neoliberalism",

Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study are the use of single-agent decision scenario and the specific focus on one aspect of agent personality - conscientiousness and its collective influence on layoff decisions. In a broader picture, the results of this study support the cross-level analytical approach to investigating organizational phenomena, in which individual-level and organizational-level factors interact and determine organizational outcomes. Practical implications: Recruiting and promoting managers who exhibit high levels of conscientiousness, coupled with proactively cultivating the norm of reciprocity with employees, are critical to a firm's thrust in attaining and sustaining stakeholder management practices with the emphasis on employees' well-being. Originality/value: While the extant literature focuses largely on the effects of layoff and the individual perceptions of downsizing and layoff, this paper examines what actually influences decision-making agents' layoff decisions. The paper expands the literature by investigating the impacts of agent conscientiousness and reciprocity norm on layoff decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Conscientiousness; Experiment; Human resource management; Layoff decision; Managers; Organizational culture; Reciprocity norm; Redundancy; United States of America",

The purpose of this paper is to develop further understanding of the merits of a cross-industry post-crisis communication strategy for certain crisis types. Design/methodology/approach: This research is a single case study focusing on the Helicopter Task Group (HTG). Thirteen members of the HTG were interviewed and 250 questionnaires distributed to the workforce. Results were analysed against a literature review of current post-crisis communication theory. Findings: The study demonstrates that where a crisis is deemed to genuinely cross company boundaries, an inter-organisational approach to post-crisis communications is of mutual benefit to all stakeholders, providing certain conditions for dialogue are met. Research limitations/implications: This paper only focuses on one crisis event. Further research is required with other inter-organisational groups formed to lead a cross-industry response to a crisis. Practical implications: This case study provides a model for cross-industry pre-crisis planning and post-crisis renewal strategy where the aim is not to attribute blame, but to respond to a wider community of concerns and issues that are deemed to cross company and institutional boundaries. Originality/value: The research demonstrates that the process of rebuilding stakeholder relationships and renewal is possible prior to any formal attribution of blame or apology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Crisis; Issues management; Oil industry; Relationship management; Stakeholders",

We investigate how local adaptive strategies are socially organised through a study of Øystre Slidre, a Norwegian mountain farming community operating close to the climatic margins. Farmers actively use informal social relations in accessing equipment and labour in order to secure production and quality of life. The importance of such relations in managing climate variability persists even with a dramatic shift towards larger scale production, increasing formalisation and economic diversification. Despite social innovations and adaptations such as the re-forming of social relationships and institutions, the concurrent reduction in the number of people involved in farming may be putting the flexibility of social networks and practices of collaboration under pressure, potentially undermining adaptive capacity to climate change.

Design/methodology/approach: Using content analysis and a quality score index, the study examined a panel data set covering the period from 1999 to 2008. The data was collected from a sample of 270 annual reports of 27 UK companies taken from the top 100 companies for corporate responsibility (BITC ranking, 2008). The research framework involves the use of signalling theory to investigate the information content of CCID. Findings: It is found that the volume of corporate community disclosure (CCID) has a significant association with its total quality score (TQS) although the impact was found to be very small. CCID was also found to be strongly and positively associated with the volume of total CSR disclosed in annual reports. Hence the quantity and quality of CCID in annual reports increased significantly as the quantity of CSR disclosure also increased. Furthermore, the TQS was found to respond to company size and Corporate Governance measures such as audit committee size and board composition, and the existence of standalone CSR Reports, while other measures of public pressure such as leverage, profitability and industrial sector were not statistically significantly related with TQS. Originality/value: This paper contributes to CSR literature in general and CCID literature in particular. The originality stems from the fact that it employs a signalling framework and a panel study approach as opposed to cross-sectional only or time-series only data to examine a less researched social disclosure - corporate community involvement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Annual reports; Community involvement; Corporate governance; Disclosures; Signalling theory; Social responsibility; United Kingdom",

A realist critique",2012,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84860589544&partnerID=40&md5=71dc1d5099a1a5a81110707189422329","Purpose: The article aims to cast a novel light on the extended theoretical conceptualisation of corporate citizenship, in as far as it criticises the insufficient embedding of international corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate social performance (CSP) and sustainability initiatives in the geopolitical reality and conflictuality of the global business environment. Design/methodology/approach: The article offers a unique interdisciplinary take on relevant research in international CSR, political science, international relations and philosophy. Its methodology is based on a literature review of these different fields. Findings: The article argues that the rules-based nature of international CSR is based on experience in the relatively benign market context of high-income economies. However, the transposition of the code-and-compliance approach to the more conflictual context of emerging markets leads to the failure of international CSR. Its insufficient catering to the particular pressures exerted on operation in these markets reveals an idealist bias. This explains the implicit endorsement of ""end-of-history"" scenarios and other neo-liberal assumptions in international CSR. The article argues that this disposition does not pay credit to the need to find adequate responses to the situation. Quite to the contrary, the firm entrenchment of (neo-)liberalism in the mental mapping of CSR blocks the way to an exploration of realist alternatives. The article concludes by suggesting a shift in the CSR research agenda, from rules to institutions and agency. It proposes historical material on leadership in emergency situations and a new reading of Machiavelli to illustrate possible avenues. Research limitations/implications: The article is based on a qualitative review and discussion of the literature, which it presents in a new light. It does not present empirical or quantitative research data. It points to a conceptual abyss separating the theory and reality of international CSR. This is particularly problematic in the light of recent deliberative models positing a ""new political role"" for the corporation. While this article follows the new model in its criticism of the traditional separation of politics and business, it advocates that further research is necessary to elucidate how a more realistic apprehension of global conflict and its impact on business can be combined with the ""arms reach principle"". Furthermore it urges that a new model must factor in the frequent ""dirty hands"" problems occurring in international business. Practical implications: The article argues that, contrary to the dominant liberal discourse in business ethics and CSR, an increasing potential for Machiavellian behavior in the corporate sector is to be expected. This is due to the absence of arbitrages, in an environment experiencing a rapid expansion of global corporate activity. This renders ""code-and-compliance"" CSR ineffective. The article recommends the ""reframing"" of CSR, to specifically include ""dirty hands"" issues. Social implications: One stumbling block to a correct understanding of the contemporary challenges impacting international business operations is the (neo-)liberal globalisation paradigm - a narrative in whose manufacture business schools and management scholars are complicit. Originality/value: The article contributes to the discussion on ""systemic CSR"". The fundamental nature of the critique, as well as its interdisciplinary orientation and original recommendations, make the contribution unique. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate and social responsibility; Critical thinking; Developing countries; Ethics; Globalization; Neo-liberalism",

Previous research on CR standardization has addressed the proliferation and organizational embedding of material practices but neglected the analysis of underlying ideational dynamics. Departing from this practice, we introduce a narrative perspective that illuminates the trajectory a CR standard follows, from being formally adopted to becoming collectively accepted as a valid solution to a problem of societal concern. We argue that this perspective helps scholars explore the dynamic interplay between symbolic and material aspects of standardization and understand better the discursive antecedents of coupling processes in organizations. Drawing on the case of the Equator Principles standard in international project finance, we empirically study how narratives create meaning shared by both business firms and their societal observers, thereby exemplifying the analytical merit of a narrative approach to CR standardization. © The Author(s) 2012.","corporate responsibility; decoupling; Equator Principles; institutionalization; narratives; standardization",

Findings: Can an ideology that excludes certain products but demands commitment from all consumers make money through its holistic interpretation of the products its customers need? Can food retailers sell good food at fair prices? This review identifies the lack of published research into the ideology of food retailing. It describes a new qualitative methodology that identifies functional and symbolic aspects of the processes and products of the retailer. It proceeds by structured interview and by document analysis to outline the most important factors driving retail success in this market niche, including an elaborate structure of customer feedback.

Although many authors of this approach have reviewed many elements of the model, they have unconditionally accepted several criteria assumed by Freeman (1984) to identify stakeholders. In general, stakeholder authors have assumed that (a) the company establishes dyadic relationships with other agents, and (b) decisions made by a company only have foreseen and direct effects on other agents. These criteria have enabled researchers to understand simple processes. However, they have also prevented researchers from explaining how action comes about, and how responsibility is shared, in many complex processes taking place in contemporary societies. Such complex processes involve many agents, and each decision can generate unexpected effects which accumulate or disseminate. Furthermore, the normative structure governing these processes can affect and/or be affected by the actions of agents. In this study, we propose new criteria to expand the stakeholder model and facilitate the study of CSR in such processes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Contemporary societies; Corporate responsibility; Effects; Relationships; Stakeholder approach",

A sound and effective moral imagination must be grounded in a healthy psyche, and needs the assistance of active imagination (or other similar activities) to achieve this. Such inner work is especially necessary for leaders to clarify their moral values and capabilities. Research limitations/implications: The Active and Moral Imagination (AMI) model proposed has not been empirically tested; therefore its implications are tentative at this stage. The paper does not discuss in detail other psychological activities which may be complementary to active imagination. Practical implications: Managers and leaders should reflect on their own unconscious, so as to understand the deeper mechanisms influencing their decisions and behaviours. Originality/value: The paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to the role of imagination in ethics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Active imagination; Consciousness; Ethics; Imagination; Jungian psychology; Moral imagination; Morals; Self-reflection",

At 8 years after the initial survey in 1999-2000, we followed up on the 999 people aged 65+ years who were living in the community in the United Kingdom. We found that 583 participants were still alive, and 287 (58%) participated in the follow-up survey. The overall prevalence of loneliness at both time points was very similar, with 9% reporting severe loneliness; 30% reporting that they were sometimes lonely, and 61% reporting that they were never lonely. We developed a 12-category typology to describe changes in loneliness across the follow-up period and report that 60% of participants had a stable loneliness rating, with 40-50% rating themselves as never lonely, and 20-25% rating themselves as persistently lonely; 25% demonstrated decreased loneliness, and approximately 15% demonstrated worse loneliness. Changes in loneliness were linked with changes in marital status, living arrangements, social networks, and physical health. Importantly improvements in physical health and improved social relationships were linked to reduced levels of loneliness. This result suggests that strategies to combat loneliness are not confined to the arena of social interventions such as befriending services, which aim to build and support social embeddedness, but may also result from the treatment of chronic and long-term health conditions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","loneliness; longitudinal study; older people","aged; article; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; disability; family size; female; human; life event; loneliness; longitudinal study; male; psychological aspect; risk factor; United Kingdom; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disability Evaluation; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Life Change Events; Loneliness; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Risk Factors; Single Person"

Evidence on this issue is not entirely consistent, however, and high levels of dispositional positive affect have sometimes been found to also be associated with detrimental outcomes (e.g., reduced task performance, biased recall of information, increased impulsivity). A framework is proposed for integrating these seemingly inconsistent findings and applying the result to entrepreneurs. Briefly, this model suggests that there are discrete limits to the benefits conferred by DPA because at very high levels, processes that interfere with specific aspects of cognition, perception, motivation, and self-regulation, operate. The overall result is a curvilinear relationship between entrepreneurs' level of DPA and their performance of tasks closely related to new venture development and growth (e.g., opportunity recognition and evaluation, effective decision making). Factors that make entrepreneurs especially susceptible to negative effects of high levels of DPA are described, and theoretical and practical implications of the proposed model are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Cognition; Emotions; Individual differences; Motivation",

Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal case study examines two regional strategic networks acting in different business areas in mid Sweden. Findings: Competition-neutral, social, and personal goals were found to be powerful drivers promoting shared values and commitment among competitors, whereas business-related goals worked well for complementary firms, providing a more stable basis for network commitment. In the RSN with a large number of members, sensitivity to absence was low, but it took longer for members to get to know one another, slowing commitment development. The RSN including members with complementary resources proved a more favorable setting than did the RSN including competitors, and frequent activities that favored social relationship development increased commitment. Research limitations/implications: This study identifies important factors influencing the development of commitment in network contexts, but is limited to two cases. The topic merits further research: other factors need consideration, and the factors discussed here should be evaluated in other contexts. Practical implications: The impact on network commitment of the factors discussed here needs to be considered by RSN initiators and hubs.

The main findings are that corporate social responsibility is negatively but weakly related to systematic firm risk and that corporate social irresponsibility is positively and strongly related to financial risk. The fact that both conventional and downside risk measures lead to the same conclusions adds convergent validity to the analysis. However, the risk-return trade-off appears to be such that no clear utility gain or loss can be realized by investing in firms characterized by different levels of social and environmental performance.

This article details what actually happens when the laws of the host country fail to ensure adequate protection. The focus here is on land dispossession and loss of livelihood in relation to a gold mine project in central Ghana. How is it that a well-known international company-Newmont-with its own corporate social responsibility (CSR) statements sets up a project in the year 2003 that displaces subsistence farmers from their land without compensating in cash or with replacement land? The analysis identifies the factors that lead the company to not compensate farmers for their lost land: cost-cutting, strict adherence to the law, CSR commitment that was new and not internalized, complexities of the Ghanaian land tenure system, peer pressure to preserve the status quo, selection of an ""old-school"" CSR manager, and the inadequacy of Ghanaian mining law to account for relatively novel, ""open-pit"" mining techniques. However, the specter of famine raised by civil society activism, the involvement of the International Financial Corporation, and a better qualified CSR team constitute another set of factors that lead to a comprehensive package of livelihood improvement measures. There is a contrast between the complexity, long-term, and advanced type of assistance Newmont currently envisages and the backward, short-term, formalism, and brutality of denying compensation for land back in 2003.

Specifically, there is a mismatch between the individualism of our common sense morality and the imperative for collaborative responses to global problems in what I will call the ""collective age."" This must have an impact also on the way we think about the responsibility of corporations. I will argue that most plausibly we ought to reframe corporate responsibility as a conception of collaborative responsibility. Such a conception of collaborative responsibility is characterized by five key elements: first, it is based on the moral imperative for collaboration. Second, it shifts emphasis from commission to omission. Third, it is not only negative but also, and perhaps essentially, positive responsibility. Fourth, it is political responsibility. And finally, it is, most basically, human rights responsibility. © 2012 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

As discourses express specific stances expressed by a group of people who share particular beliefs and values, they constitute an important means of restoring organisational legitimacy when social rules and norms have been violated. Using an analytical framework based on legitimacy as a process of reciprocal sense-making and consisting of three levels of analysis which capture the relationship between text and context, we investigate the discourse used by CEOs in their initial and subsequent accounts of the incident. We find that CEOs aim to negotiate a resolution between their initial account and organisational audiences' incongruent interpretations of the event by adopting an ad hoc normative attitude to stakeholders. This manifests itself in the strategic use of the discourse of stakeholder engagement as a means of signalling change, yet maintaining the status quo. It suggests that CEOs strategically use discourse to manufacture organisational audiences' consent regarding the continued operation of the nuclear power plant affected by the incident. Our findings contribute to the critical corporate communication literature which regards corporate narrative reporting as a means of consolidating the private interests of corporations, rather than increasing transparency and accountability. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Discourse; Impression management; Legitimacy; Nuclear industry; Stakeholder management",

Hence, knowledge management (KM) has been extensively researched. Prior knowledge management research has recognized the importance of making individual knowledge available throughout the organization. Most KM research, however, has thus far focused on a technology-based KM strategy with relatively little discussion on how knowledge can be effectively shared using organizational social relationships. This paper focuses on how knowledge-intensive organizations can design and use knowledge flow networks (KFNs) in order to facilitate knowledge sharing. Designing and using KFNs to maximize knowledge sharing is a complex problem. We formulate a mixed integer programming model (MIP), and present a heuristic in order to facilitate systematic analysis and understanding of effective KFNs. We consider organizations that support multiple skills and have workers with varying levels of competence who are connected through IT-facilitated organizational social relationships. Our results, based on computational experiments, provide several interesting insights and intelligence into the design of an effective KFN. First, our results highlight that average workers play a vital bridging role in knowledge sharing. Second, social networking concepts of ties and cohesiveness are used to better understand the dynamics of knowledge sharing. The importance of indirect relationships between expert workers and the network effects due to indirect relationships are illustrated. For effective KM, we also illustrate how organizations can reduce the total number of ties required in a multi-skill environment. In our model extensions, we study the impact of worker turnover and knowledge depreciation on the design and use of effective KFNs. Managerial implications of these results are discussed. The model and solution procedure proposed in this paper can serve as a managerial benchmarking framework for effective management of KFNs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context. Findings: Public sensitivity to issues that include climate change, preservation of natural resources, oppression and human rights has risen drastically over recent decades. A key upshot of this concern is the belief that businesses have some obligation towards these and other issues. The burden of expectation is daunting for some firms. To others, however, this societal shift equals opportunity rather than threat. Corporate responsibility is now high on the agenda of such companies to a degree that they are constantly seeking innovative ways to function in a more sustainable manner. Exploiting developments and trends demands effective leadership. But without the necessary array of skills and attitudes, senior leaders will struggle to successfully navigate their organizations through the sea of global change.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted through a multi-site, comparative case study using three large corporations with exemplary sustainability standings. Key employees from each organization were interviewed. Interview transcripts and sustainability reports were analyzed using discourse analysis, and a constructivist approach to grounded theory was used to build a model for how sustainability emerges at the organizational, functional, and individual levels. Findings: Within the corporations studied, different perspectives toward sustainability exist. At the organizational level, senior leadership defines sustainability and establishes an integrated culture by aligning sustainability with business purposes and driving sustainability priorities through the organization. At the functional level, managers assume a differentiated perspective and translate organizational sustainability goals into tools and programs for facilities, suppliers, and employees. At the individual level, based upon different cultural influences, independent actors assume a fragmented perspective. Each of these perspectives influences the others and is essential to the long-term success of a commitment to sustainability. Research limitations/implications: Viewing sustainability through multiple perspectives presents an interesting approach for research. Most sustainability literature addresses change from an organizational level. Therefore, addressing sustainability change from an organizational, a subcultural, and an individual level provides further insight into how sustainability develops within organizations. Originality/value: There are different and often contradictory views of how sustainability develops within organizations. This paper provides fresh insight into this process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Organizational change; Organizational culture; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Triple bottom line",

However, it was already clear that book publishing, like every other industry would have to face up to the incipient challenges posed by the growing global phenomena of organizational sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Clearly this would require a response of a different order than before, not least in view of the greatly expanded range of potential factors involved. Our treatment of sustainability addresses two main themes: sustainability in the context of global concerns about resource depletion and destruction of the biosphere, and organizational sustainability in the at times adversarial relationship between profit seeking and good corporate citizenship. This paper begins with a look at some of the key terminology around sustainability in order to reinforce its relevance and applicability to the publishing industry. This necessarily limited treatment is confined to four key concepts namely: corporate sustainability, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance and corporate measurement and reporting. We then present some evidence for industry response to the principles and practical challenges of sustainability and relate these to implications for the design of appropriate business models.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds upon the extant relational theories in management, and presents a holistic multi-level framework (the system/network, issue-based or strategic nets, dyadic relationships and the network organization) to conceptualize change for sustainability. Findings: By adopting INA business is able to discuss: the nature and role of the network in building systems level change; the role of dyadic relations as a central mechanism for change; and the nature of organizational level capabilities necessary to enhance learning for sustainability. Research limitations/implications: Areas of future inquiry include examination of the dynamics of intra-stakeholder relationships over time, specifically the development of actors' attitudes, behavior and cognition in business networks alongside how actors perceive and capitalize on network embedded learning. Further scholarly attention in these areas can further the appreciation of how an INA can assist in building more sustainable organizational futures. Practical implications: The paper builds on the concept of ""ecological literacy"" at an organizational level, and considers the specific capabilities required including network visioning, orchestration and the ability to perceive the ""other"" as partners in creating new market realities.

Specifically, we examine how three areas of accounting expertise (risk identification and measurement, financial reporting, and independent review/assurance) contribute to the strategic integration of sustainability initiatives (cf. Porter and Kramer 2006; IIRC 2011). Our results indicate that accounting professionals are rarely involved in sustainability initiatives, but their involvement is highly associated with strategic integration. This finding suggests that increased involvement likely would provide significant benefits to organizations and their stakeholders. We use these and other important insights into a series of research questions for future accounting or interdisciplinary research in sustainability. These insights about accountants' ability to enhance the strategic integration of sustainability initiatives also should be of interest to accounting and consulting firms as they design and market their sustainability services.","Corporate social responsibility; Integrated reporting; Strategy; Sustainability",

Under the umbrella of change management today frequently holistic approaches are discussed. The special significance of soft factors results from the area of tension of subjective/personal risk assessment of certain groups of actors, which entail comprehensive changes. As change projects depend on implementation by executives and employees, change communications is a form of (internal) strategic stakeholder management. Change communications can be identified as the single part of change management, which focuses on the soft factors that are activated through the change of hard factors. With the management of soft factors the aim is to make a contribution to the enforcement of change goals, i.e. to secure or to regain the management's power. For this purpose 60 PR-agencies in Germany have been polled, as to how they assess the possibilities and reality of change communications. The result illustrates a torn of the agency scene between service and consulting claims, which emphasizes the question, if (internal) communication means the organization of messages and its delivery or also becomes part of behavioral economics with the idea to control the power of management. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..","Change communications; Change management; Internal communications; Power",

Even Congress has expressed concern about the crisis in nonprofit governance. The nonprofit response to Congress has been a historic initiative recognizing critical challenges to nonprofit governance. In contrast to their for-profit counterparts, nonprofits are committed to missions serving the public benefit and not to shareholder profits. Accordingly, their missions and financial resources are intrinsic to their very existence, which is built upon the public trust. That trust is rooted in fiduciary responsibility and reflected in best practices. This article traces the history of the nonprofit public trust and fiduciary standards and examines principles of Sarbanes-Oxley and other best practices as they apply to nonprofits. The authors sampled 80 health-care nonprofit corporation web sites from eight asset classes to determine compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley and identification of fiduciary duty, ethical values, and other best practices. Among the very largest health-care nonprofits, many comply with Sarbanes-Oxley and identify fiduciary duty, ethical values, and other best practices. However, there are substantial deficiencies in such compliance and identification among all remaining seven asset classes ranging from 99.9 million to less than 100,000. The results appear to corroborate the urgent necessity for reform articulated by the Congress and the nonprofit sector. Nonprofit governance has entered a new era where best practices must be implemented to sustain the public trust. © 2012 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

The notion of an ethical framework has received little critical attention, however, and the concept subsequently lends itself easily to misuse and ambiguous application. This is the case with the 'ethical framework' offered by Canada's Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO), the crown-corporation which owns and is responsible for the long-term management of Canada's high-level nuclear fuel waste. It makes a very specific claim, namely that it is managing Canada's long-lived radioactive nuclear fuel waste in an ethically responsible manner. According to this organization, what it means to behave in an ethically responsible manner is to act and develop policy in accordance with its ethical framework. What, then, is its ethical framework, and can it be satisfied? In this paper I will show that the NWMO's ethical and social framework is deeply flawed in two respects: (a) it fails to meet the minimum requirements of a code of ethic or ethical framework by offering only questions, and no principles or rules of conduct; and (b) if posed as principles or rules of conduct, some of its questions are unsatisfiable. In particular, I will show that one of its claims, namely that it seek informed consent from individuals exposed to risk of harm from nuclear waste, cannot be satisfied as formulated. The result is that the NWMO's ethical framework is not, at present, ethically acceptable. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ethical acceptability; Ethical framework; Ethics; Informed consent; Nuclear waste; Philosophy; Policy","article; business ethics; Canada; environmental exposure; ethics; human; informed consent; medical ethics; policy; practice guideline; radioactive waste; social behavior; waste management; Canada; Codes of Ethics; Environmental Exposure; Ethics, Business; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Informed Consent; Policy; Radioactive Waste; Social Responsibility; Waste Management"

The analysis suggests the vulnerability of both marketer and consumer are mutually reinforcing and that we need, somehow, to break this damaging cycle of dependence. We know little, however, about how marketers think and feel about their discipline, so this paper also promotes an agenda for marketer behaviour research, as a countervailing balance to a currently disproportionate focus on the consumer. © The Author(s) 2012.","Erich Fromm; job fit; marketer behaviour; marketing ethics; personality; recession",

We propose a departure from self-regulation in that researchers adopt the financial accounting approach in establishing trust through an external validation process, in addition to the reporting entities and the regulatory agencies. The general conceptual framework for reviewing financial reports, utilizes external auditors who are certified and objective in using established standards to provide an opinion on the financial reports. These standards have become both broader in scope and increasingly specific as to what information is reported and the methodologies to be employed. We believe that the financial reporting overhaul encompassed in the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which aims at preventing accounting fraud, can be applied to scientific research in 4 ways. First, Sarbanes-Oxley requires corporations to have a complete set of internal accounting controls. Research organizations should use appropriate sampling techniques and audit research projects for conformity with the initial research protocols. Second, corporations are required to have the chief financial officer certify the accuracy of their financial statements. In a similar way, each research organization should have their vice-president of research (or equivalent) certify the research integrity of their research activities. In contrast, the primary responsibility of the existing Research Integrity Officers is to handle allegations of research misconduct, an after-the-fact activity. Third, generally accepted auditing standards specify the appropriate procedures for external review of a corporation's financial statements. For similar reasons, the research review process would also require corresponding external auditing standards. Finally, these new requirements would be implemented in stages, with the largest 14 research organizations that receive 25% of the total National Institutes of Health funding, adopting these research oversight enhancements first. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accounting; Disclosure; Financial audit; Mandatory reporting; Professional autonomy; Publishing standards; Research ethics; Sarbanes-Oxley; Scientific misconduct; Trust","accounting; article; business ethics; ethics; fraud; human; practice guideline; research ethics; science; scientific misconduct; standard; trust; United States; Ethics, Business; Ethics, Research; Financial Audit; Fraud; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Science; Scientific Misconduct; Trust; United States"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs participant observation within an interpretivistic methodological approach. This provides critical incident vignettes with which to explore issues. Findings: The argument contends that macro-events in relation to either (un)sustainable and (ir)responsible events are rooted in ""micro-moments"" centred on behaviour and choices. These myriad choices occur repeatedly - a dilemma captured by the metaphor of Janus. Underpinned by templates of Aristotelian virtue ethics and Kantian deontology, the paper argues that consistent ""good"" character"" and ""good behaviour"" are central to ensuring sustainable change. Alternatively, ""bad"" character and behaviours have a propensity to engender ambivalent unsustainable and irresponsible environments. Social implications: The work heightens awareness of seemingly ""insignificant"" micro-behaviour in organizations undergoing processes of change. If allowed to occur without redress, negative micro-moments lead to negative impacts on the macro-aspects of the organization whereas positive moments tend to engender more sustainable and responsible environments.

Data were gathered from the IRS Corporate Statistics of Income Sourcebook, data that provide firm size class measures covering the entire firm size distribution ranging from small retailers up to large multi-national retail firms.

However, formal institutions cannot function without being internalized by the citizens and without the strong backing of social norms. Morality and social norms are the major elements of the informal institutional structure, the social capital, which is also critical for social welfare and economic development. In this paper we will discuss both the formal and the informal institutional framework of Ancient Athens, which was a free market society with economic problems similar to contemporary market societies. Athenians developed a highly sophisticated legal framework for the protection of private property, the enforcement of contracts and the efficient resolution of disputes. Such an institutional framework functioned effectively, cultivating trust and protecting the security of transactions. This entire system however was based on social norms such as reciprocity, the value of reputation and widely accepted business ethics. Conformity to social norms as well as moral behavior was fostered by social sanction mechanisms (such as stigma) and moral education. The Athenian example is a further proof of the importance of morality and social norms as transaction cost-saving devices even in quite sophisticated legal systems. Their absence or decline leads inevitably to the need for more regulation and litigation and to a growing preference for clear-cut rules instead of discretionary standards. Athenian law was pioneering in the development of rules and institutional mechanisms suitable for the reduction of transaction costs, many of them surviving in the most complex contemporary legal systems. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ancient Athens; Economic growth; Institutions; Legal system; Morality; Social capital; Social norms; Transaction costs",

This is somewhat surprising given that employees are essentially the face of their organization and are largely expected to act as ambassadors for the organization's CSR program (Collier and Esteban in Bus Ethics 16:19-33, 2007). The current research, by conducting depth interviews with employees, builds a better understanding of how employees differentiate between authentic and inauthentic CSR programs, and how these judgments influence their perceptions of the organization. We find that employees rely on two different referent standards to form authenticity judgments-the extent to which the image put forth in the CSR program aligns with the organization's true identity and the extent to which the CSR program itself is developmental. To assess the former, employees draw on cues about resource commitment, alignment between elements of the organization's CSR program, emotional engagement, justice, and embeddedness. The latter assessments are based on the extent to which the organization adopts a leadership role with regards to its CSR initiatives. We also find that perceived authenticity can lead to positive outcomes such as organizational identification and employee connections. This study contributes to the broad literatures on both CSR and authenticity, as well as more specifically adding to the conversation on authenticity as a potentially valuable lens for enriching business ethics theorizing. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Authenticity; Corporate social responsibility; Employee perceptions; Interviews; Organizational self; Socially constructed standard",

The methodology is based on the model presented by Carroll (1979), considering the different interdisciplinary dimensions contemplated by CSR. The survey results are used to construct a second order factorial model that enables us to measure and evaluate firms' CSR considering the concept's different dimensions. The model enables us to globally measure firms' CSP by integrating its different dimensions and learning specific details of the variables involved and their relationships, and could be a useful guide for corporations willing to objectively implement sustainability management. We apply the procedure to evaluate the behaviour of a sample of 416 Spanish firms. Our results suggest that there is a positive relationship between firms' CSP and aspects such as size, degree of CSR awareness and stakeholder pressure. Therefore, in order to increase the degree of CSR implantation in Spanish firms, specific lines of action aimed at increasing the level of awareness of CSR practices should be addressed, particularly at small firms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the technique of panel data in a sample of 624 American listed companies from 2001 to 2007. The literature review builds on the contradictions between the instrumental stakeholder theory and the slack-resources hypothesis to argue that both concepts are not fully compatible. Findings - The results indicate that prior financial performance, measured as market value added, positively affects CSP. The results further confirm that slack resources are assigned to specific areas of involvement of CSP (product issues, community relations, environmental issues, employee relations and diversity of the work force), rather than to a unified conception of CSP. Research limitations/implications - The current trend in social responsibility regards Friedman's arguments as old-fashioned and assumes the instrumental stakeholder to be true. The results presented here indicate that part of Friedman's claims may be occurring in reality, so further investigation is needed before they are disregarded. Practical implications - The multidimensional nature of CSP, here proposed and confirmed by the exploratory models, indicates that each dimension of social performance may be impacted by the availability of funds different intensities; and according to the instrumental view (assuming the virtuous circle is true), investment in each particular dimension may provide a different level of return to the firm. Originality/value - The slack resources hypothesis has been the least researched of the two hypotheses relating to the corporate social and financial performance (CSP and CFP) links. Although the slack resources hypothesis may explain the relation as well as the good management hypothesis, most studies tend to focus on the first one, basing their argumentation on the assumption that superior CFP comes as a result of a strategic CSP.

They offer a multilevel and multidisciplinary theoretical framework that synthesizes and integrates the literature at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels of analysis. The framework includes reactive and proactive predictors of CSR actions and policies and the outcomes of such actions and policies, which they classify as primarily affecting internal (i.e., internal outcomes) or external (i.e., external outcomes) stakeholders. The framework includes variables that explain underlying mechanisms (i.e., relationship- and value-based mediator variables) of CSR-outcomes relationships and contingency effects (i.e., people-, place-, price-, and profile-based moderator variables) that explain conditions under which the relationship between CSR and its outcomes change. The authors' review reveals important knowledge gaps related to the adoption of different theoretical orientations by researchers studying CSR at different levels of analysis, the need to understand underlying mechanisms linking CSR with outcomes, the need for research at micro levels of analysis (i.e., individuals and teams), and the need for methodological approaches that will help address these substantive knowledge gaps. Accordingly, they offer a detailed research agenda for the future, based on a multilevel perspective that aims to integrate diverse theoretical frameworks as well as develop an understanding of underlying mechanisms and microfoundations of CSR (i.e., foundations based on individual action and interactions).

Follow-on analysis indicates that this effect is not attributable to an entrant's ability to make ice wines of superior quality or to it having access to better distribution knowledge.

The science of governance provides a sustainable future for corporate governance theory and practice. Good governance is defined as the ability of organizations in the private, public and non-profit sectors to achieve their purpose in the most efficacious manner while minimizing the need for laws, regulations, regulators, courts or codes of so called best practices to protect and further the interests of their stakeholders and society. Evidence is provided that current best practices: (a) did not prevent firms failing to create the 2008 financial crisis; (b) are not based on theory or conclusive empirical evidence; and (c) are inconsistent with common sense. Systemic problems arising from organizations governed by a single board are identified. These include the absolute power of directors to manage their own conflicts of interest to allow the corruption of themselves and the organization. Examples of organizations with over a hundred boards show how network governance provides: (a) division of powers; (b) checks and balances; (c) distributed intelligence; (d) decomposition in decision making labor; (e) cross checking communication and control channels from stakeholder engagement; (f) integration of management and governance to further self-regulation and self-governance with: (g) operating advantage and sustainability. The examples illustrate how an ecological form of network governance could reduce the size, scope, cost and intrusiveness of government and their regulators while improving economic efficiency, resiliency and enriching democracy with widespread citizen stakeholder engagement. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

The investigation focuses on two main questions: What are the core components for the development of a CSR brand? What capabilities are necessary to implement a CSR-related brand strategy? Design/methodology/approach: Five firms provide input for a multiple case-based approach. Findings: Intuitive and intended approaches for CSR brand leadership emerge from the multiple case study results. Different capabilities are required at each stage of the development and implementation process for CSR brand leadership. Research limitations/implications: This research extends three prior studies - Aaker and Joachimsthaler's brand leadership framework, Maon et al.'s proposed integrative framework for designing and implementing CSR, and Beverland et al.'s capabilities view on the development of global brand leadership - and fills a theoretical gap. Practical implications: Managers can use the proposed integrated and implementable framework to determine the impact of dynamic factors, such as ownership, culture, executive leadership, and the specific context of product and corporate branding, on the development and implementation of their CSR brand. Originality/value: No studies examine how to leverage CSR in brand-building activities. Specifically, no empirically grounded research examines the required path to create and manage CSR brands and associated benefits, nor is the number of capabilities required to develop a credible CSR brand clear.

The need for increased scrutiny of corporate governance, greater corporate accountability and monitoring has been repeatedly highlighted. As a result, a new trend has been developed the last few years, according to which business success and shareholder value cannot be achieved solely through maximizing short-term profits, but instead through market-oriented yet responsible behavior. Failure to effectively manage both the financial and non-financial aspects of corporate responsibility places shareholder value at risk. However, it is extremely difficult to achieve total transformation of the objectives of the company or the market system, thus the right approach is not to shift the focus away from shareholder value, but to reaffirm shareholder value as the central focus of corporate responsibility. The rules of the corporate game have changed and corporate boards are required to change the existing corporate mentality, in order to create companies, which are sustainable and economically, ethically and socially responsible. The enlightened shareholder value theory represents an attempt to strike a balance between shareholders' primacy and corporate stakeholders' interests. Effective corporate social responsibility management is not incompatible with shareholder value and having wider interests can be the key to long-term financial performance. Companies should not be seen only as vehicles for profit maximization, but as having a wider social role.

Design/methodology/approach: The data on which this study is based were generated through secondary research using published sources and primary research through focused discussion with industry experts and personal interviews with over 100 experts from leading banks selected using a structured questionnaire. Findings: It was found that most of the public sector banks scored high on the continuity forces and relatively low on the change forces. Most of the private-sector banks studied scored high on continuity and also high on change forces making them more competitive, except one bank which is low on both the forces because it is a newly established bank. The study suggests that there is a need for public sector banks to focus their strategies on factors affecting change forces for the improvement of their overall performance in the long run. Social implications: The paper brings in the need for social responsibility for private sector banks and a need for a fine balance in forces of continuity and change for a long-term sustainable business model. Originality/value: This research paper represents one of the few efforts to study the business process management of retail banking in India from a strategic perspective and come out with a flexible strategic framework for managing forces of continuity and change for guiding this sector for its long-term survival and growth. The flexible framework suggested and the C-C Matrix can be of interest to researchers and practising managers to validate the applicability for other sectors, such as financial services, insurance, corporate finance, mortgages, risk management and other domains. The framework suggested can be adapted for application in the global context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banks; Business process management; Change management; Flexibility; India; Private and foreign banks; Public sector banks; Retail banking; Strategic framework",

We focus specifically on consumers' self-perceptions and metaperceptions in gift-giving situations, including how these processes are linked to the givers' gender and the strength of the relationships between givers and receivers. Deriving support from the existing gift card literature, our findings suggest that reducing social risks is one of the dominant reasons driving people to choose gift cards; risk reduction is more prominent in situations when gift cards are a last resort, rather than the giver's first choice. Moreover, we find that when social relationships between givers and recipients are weak, givers are more concerned about meeting their own social needs than their recipients' needs. The implications and results of this study can be applied by retailers, such as when designing customized gift cards, and by academics, in better understanding gift-giving paradigms. © 2012 M.E.

Design/methodology/approach: The article employs three separate studies; two are conducted with customers of Curves, the world's largest fitness franchise, and the other is conducted at a weight-lifting gym. Two empirical studies test a proposed mediation model using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping techniques. The third study represents a humanistic inquiry that elucidates the social influences that encourage a customer to purchase a service firm's logo products. Findings: The results show that a customer's integration into a service-based community encourages him or her to purchase the firm's logo merchandise. In addition, a customer's ability to identify with the firm mediates this relationship. The immersion of customers' self- and social identities in a firm emerges as a critical factor to enhancing their appreciation of the firm by purchasing financially lucrative logo consumables. Research limitations/implications: The article theoretically links customer voluntary performance with a customer's integration into a service community (ISC), organizational identification, and pooled associations. Because the concept of ISC is newly coined in this article, researchers are encouraged to develop the concept both empirically and theoretically. Practical implications: Service and retail managers should understand that a key to selling organizational logo/branded merchandise is to encourage customers to form in-house social relationships with other customers and employees. Originality/value: The article demonstrates that service-based customer communities are often lucrative for service firms.

This successful methodology involves innovation (I), action learning (AL), and extends throughout the organisation (O). The authors show that the resultant IALO is a repeatable and transferable approach to sustainable business performance enhancement; also that IALO adequately covers ""Senge's many faces"" as identified by Ortenblad and enables effective change built on ""best practice"" business process systems engineering. Design/methodology/approach - IALO has evolved over a significant time span traceable back to, and exploiting the ""Concept of a Manufacturing System"". What is described in the paper is the proven working format, best procedures, and evidence of effective change. It has been embedded in appropriate systems epistemology and learning organisation literature to form a comprehensive contribution to knowledge of practical business process improvement. Findings - This IALO has proven transferability across a wide geographical and market sector. To date the methodology has always had continuity via central engineering expertise available in an advisory capacity (as frequently happens with Toyota Production Systems specialists). This particular IALO has yet to be extensively tested outside such a scenario. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides one proven evolutionary and experiential route to actual implementation of an effective learning organisation capable of delivering substantially improved core business process performance. It thus provides a comprehensive framework against which future alternative approaches may be assessed. Practical implications - Exploiting task force execution via IALO requires active (not passive) support and resourcing at all levels in the enterprise. To ensure that adequate expertise in business process systems engineering is available, smaller organisations can be grouped together in club-style configurations. Originality/value - It has been previously shown in JMTM how a conceptual flow model of a business may be transposed into an integrated process methodology to engineer effective and sustainable business change.

This topic is important as it is a sustainable business model. It is proposed that the uncertainty consumers have towards the suitability of PSS to their needs can be further explored using existing management tools such as SERVQUAL, a tool to measure customer satisfaction and perceived quality. Design/methodology/approach - This study, supported by the British Academy, utilized qualitative research on two types of respondents: Businesses that can be classified eco-efficient PSS providers; and consumers. The providers were administered structured in-depth interviews, and the respondents are Mr Chas Ball, Director of Policy at Car Plus, a trade association representing car clubs, and Mr Jonathan Hampson, Director of Streetcar, the largest car club company. Car clubs may be considered a type of eco-efficient PSS. Consumers were involved in four focus groups (20 participants in total). The questioning route used in the two focus groups focused the attention of the participants on two types of eco-efficient PSS provision: One represented by car-sharing services, such as the ones provided by City Car Club and Street Car, mentioned in section 2; the other was an hypothetical provision of a bundle of maternity equipment and services, such as baby prams, baby car seats, travel cots and similar. The inclusion of this ""hypothetical"" provision wasinspired by a study conducted in Sweden by Mont et al. Findings - Consumers are favourable to PSS provisions in principle; however they have concerns on whether this type of provision will live up to their expectations. These concerns are that the PSS might not perform satisfactorily in terms of its assurance, reliability, responsiveness, empathy and tangible components. The attractive aspect of PSS to consumers is as a ""bundle"" or products and services where the product can be replaced to accommodate consumers' needs. Business managers and policy makers will need to devise communications to reassure consumers that PSS provision meets the requirements set out by the SERVQUAL scale. Originality/value - This paper identifies the applicability of a service quality measurement tool, SERVQUAL, to product service systems (PSS) and it extends the knowledge on consumers' acceptance of PSS. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Assurance; Consumer acceptance; Consumer behaviour; Marketing of PSS; Product service system; Reliability; Responsiveness; SERVQUAL","Assurance; Consumer acceptance; Product-service systems; Responsiveness; SERVQUAL; Consumer behavior; Reliability; Seats; Customer satisfaction"

Focusing on the connections between these activities and corporate strategy, the paper seeks to investigate the main trends in corporate philanthropy development over the period 2007-2010, assuming that corporate philanthropy is an integral part of corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical framework is based on the recognition of ""strategic"" philanthropy as a part as well as the main trend in current philanthropic activities of leading companies. The analysis as such is settled on survey data collected from participants in the national ""Corporate Philanthropy Leaders"" award competition conducted by the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti, PwC, and the non-profit grant-making organization ""Donors Forum"" from 2008 to 2011. Findings: The results testify to strengthening connections between corporate philanthropy and corporate strategy, enhancing the strategic nature of philanthropy as such. Here the responding companies significantly diversified the directions of their philanthropic activities, whereas the distribution of corporate philanthropy by form showed a high stability that was practically unaffected by the economic crisis of 2008-2009. A common practice is the professionalization of managing corporate philanthropy, with a growing role for CSR departments. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on the activities of leading Russian companies participating in the national ""Corporate Philanthropy Leaders"" award competition, thereby restricting the analysis of non-participants. Moreover, the evolution of competition surveys and their methodology as well as relatively low repetition of participants also restrict the degree of generalization. Future research could be based on the findings of this study to create hypotheses to be tested on a broader sample of Russian companies. Originality/value: The majority of studies of corporate philanthropy in Russia are still covering the necessity of corporate philanthropy for resolving societal problems and describing particular ""best practice"" cases rather than analyzing the relation of corporate philanthropy to the whole system of CSP and its strategic applications.

The question can be asked whether-in a spirit of reciprocity, loyalty and fairness-stakeholders should treat the corporation in a fair and responsible way. This study based on different definitions of stakeholders argues that various stakeholder attributes differ for different categories of stakeholders. This analysis presumes that the attribute of stakeholder reciprocity can probably be restricted to real stakeholders, labelled stakeowners: genuine stakeholders with a legitimate stake, the loyal partners who strive for mutual benefits.

The objective is to motivate business and national leaders to do so with sustainability mindsets and strategic leadership. The pre-conditions that will accelerate the ""motivation"" to do so are identified, as are interventions identified. The sphere of influence business and national leaders have to impact sustainable globalization is identified. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is to focus on information in the public domain that outlines the ""real"" challenges faced by nations and business as they consider the need for sustainability and key issues such as ""poverty and climate change"", which if not addressed could have detrimental strategic implications for the planet, business and nations. The changes that have taken place since 1982 when global leaders signed up to Agenda 21 and the relatively insignificant movement that has occurred to date is outlined to strengthen the case for quantum leaps in the short to medium term. The strategic framework recommended is one that combines the need for organizations to set a new gold standard for ""corporate responsibility"", which is a ""commitment to sustainable business"" followed by a commitment to differentiating the business or nation on a sustainability paradigm. This is presented as means to embedding sustainability in strategy in the form of the concept of ""strategic corporate sustainability"". The concept of strategic corporate sustainability is presented as a two-step approach that initially requires both national and corporate leaders to commit to the need for sustainability by developing triple bottom line strategies. This is followed by the need to embed sustainability strategy as the corporate strategy that differentiates the nation and the business, strategically setting it apart from those that have not done so. This is presented as one of the ways to move forward to achieve the goal of sustainable globalization. Findings: The key findings from information in the public domain of nations and business that have embedded a sustainability policy and are demonstrating that enlightened leaders who have sustainability mindsets as a primary requirement for the future are presented with the examples of General Electric and Unilever. The process of nations embedding sustainability policy, which in turn motivates business to strive for sustainable business, which finally leads to sustainable consumption, is presented in a sequential manner.

Starting from the basic assumption that managers cannot meet all stakeholders' demands immediately and in a tailored manner, I contend, first, that an ambidextrous approach to stakeholder management is conducive to stakeholders' commitment to cooperate for the sustainable well-being of the firm and, second, that firm strategy and key decision makers' ethical commitment moderate the relationship between an ambidextrous stakeholder management and stakeholder commitment to cooperate. Furthermore, drawing on this theoretical framework, I attempt to address the call for the integration of strategy and ethics by proposing a three-level conceptual model that distinguishes the objectives, the field, and the levers of integration.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a theoretical analysis based on secondary data and empirical research. Findings: Business has various roles to play in the social and economic development of poorer countries, but are all of them equally important and laudable? Mainstream economics has long held that the private sector is essential to economic prosperity, and this has led policy-makers and neoliberal thinkers to treat it as a tool for development. But under what circumstances does business go beyond acting out its assigned role as a tool of development to become what this article calls a ""development agent"" - something that consciously strives to deliver, and moreover be held to account for, developmental outcomes? Research limitations/implications: The article presents a framework for a more structured approach to further empirical research, but does not claim to apply that framework in empirical situations. Social implications: Despite the considerable literature advocating why business should be a development agent, much less attention has been paid to two more fundamental questions: whether and under what circumstances business will take on such a role; and what being a development agent means. These are the central questions of this article. Answering them enables business practitioners, policy-makers and academics to predict more accurately when business engagement is likely to deliver genuine development value and be sustainable, and hence when it is a worthwhile business, advocacy or policy objective. It also enables improved decision-making by non-private sector partners such as development agencies and NGOs. Originality/value: The article addresses the above questions in turn with reference to empirical research by the author over nearly two decades, and both the corporate responsibility and the international development literature. It discusses what being a genuine development agent means, and provides a framework for understanding the business-poverty relationship based on business as a cause, a victim, and a solution in international development terms. It concludes with a discussion of how well business is performing as a development agent, and the future potential and limitations of this role. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bottom of the pyramid; Corporate responsibility; Economic development; International development; Poverty; Social enterprise; Social responsibility",

This paper aims to provide insights into the necessary conditions for such a new era of development and specifically the potential contribution of business and academia. Design/methodology/approach: This explorative study is based on expert interviews and the summary of the discussion of the EABIS Colloquium 2011 (""Corporate Responsibility and Developing Countries""). Findings: Innovative companies are moving from building ""shareholder value"" to ""shared value"" for all stakeholders; from ""quarterly capitalism"" to ""long-term capitalism"". They are also providing resources, open access systems and capital to entrepreneurs and communities to support technology and knowledge transfers. Companies that integrate future development concerns into their business model will be ideally placed to secure long-term licences to operate, develop loyal new consumer bases, and innovate in new market segments. Research limitations/implications: The methodology only allows preliminary findings for now. More research (also on the ground) will be needed to identify the necessary strategies business has to adopt to play a potent role in a new era for development. Originality/value: The paper is based on a rich set of data and combines these findings with the thinking of the EABIS Colloquium 2011.

The purpose of this paper is to report a study on analyzing how transformational leadership is related to followers' meaning in life and subjective wellbeing, with psychological empowerment being a mediating variable. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 285 managers (69 females and 215 males) of a large manufacturing organization in western India. They responded to questions about their superior's transformational leadership and their own empowerment, meaning in life and wellbeing. Findings: Empowerment mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and follower's meaning in life and wellbeing. Research limitations/implications: Same-source bias is a possible limitation of the study. Leader's self-rating on transformational leadership could be taken, but it would not be as valid as the rating given by followers. Another limitation is the collection of all data at the same time. Practical implications: The strong and positive relationship between empowerment and meaning in life sheds light on making followers see greater meaning in life. Attempts to enhance meaning in life should first focus on increasing self-efficacy. If followers do not have faith in their own capability to do their job, it may not be possible for them to see meaning in life. Originality/value: This study adds to the existing literature by clarifying the process by which transformational leaders enhance followers' meaning in life and subjective wellbeing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Empowerment; India; Manufacturing industries; Meaning in life; Self-efficacy; Subjective wellbeing; Transformational leadership",

Some studies offer criteria for successful bids and even consider the stakeholder network as a key factor. Considering the importance of the stakeholder network, we delve deeper into this area. Using the power, legitimacy and urgency framework by . Mitchell et al. (1997), we examine the 2018 Olympic Winter Games' French national bid competition (four candidacies) to analyse the stakeholder relationships, identify their salience and then determine stakeholder-based bid key success factors. Archival material and 28 interviews were analysed. We notably found that to increase the probability of winning, no actor alone should have a definitive status, the sport stakeholder group should have at least the expectant status, and no strategic stakeholder should have the latent status. We also find that a three-level analysis of the stakeholder network allows for a greater understanding of the bid governance and process dynamics at play, which help to elucidate a successful bid. We contribute to the literature by (a) showing how stakeholder salience analysis can assist in understanding the bid network governance structure; (b) demonstrating that stakeholder salience depends on the level which is analysed (local, between bids, and with the event owner), the stage (deciding to bid, national bid competition, national bid win/international competition), and the case/context; and (c) determining stakeholder-based key bid success factors such as who should and should not be more salient in the bid process. © 2012 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.","Bid; Major sporting events; Olympic Games; Stakeholder",

Using sustainability as the focus of concern is significant as it provides us with a more tenable and quantifiable standard for action, as in the case of carbon offsets and development of measures such as the United Nations Sustainability Indicators.

Non-whites were disadvantaged because of structures that limited their economic and social opportunities, leaving few from this vast group in the formal economy. Black economic empowerment (BEE and its more recent broad-based version) is a policy intervention driven from the economic and industrial complex in government. Aimed directly at addressing the economy's skewed racial profile, BEE calls the private sector to restructure itself and create opportunities for previously disadvantaged individuals (PDIs). The policy requires change to intra and inter-firm relational patterns of capital and control, personnel selection, promotion and development, supplier selection, enterprise development and social engagement. Organisational theory argues that these kinds of intra and inter-firm relational structures and the networks they establish influence who participates in economies and how these people benefit. This argument supports the contention that BEE's focal changes are necessary to open the economy and adjust its racial composition. If the structures that have entrenched patterns of access to economic opportunities remain static they will not allow inclusion of previously excluded groups. The argument could also be used to view BEE as a potential South African growth catalyst. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Entrepreneurship; Growth; South Africa",

The decisions surrounding Green IS implementation strategies, policies, and tools provide compelling challenges for organizations. As practitioners have been highly interested in this topic for a while (known as Green IT), there has also been a recent growing interest in Green IS within the IS academic community. In this chapter, we conduct a systematic and comprehensive review of both the practitioner and academic literatures surrounding Green IS. Specifically, our review includes articles published in the IS academic Senior Scholar's Basket of Journals, hybrid journals such as Communications of the ACM, IEEE Software, and MIS Quarterly Executive, and practitioner outlets such as CIO magazine and PC World. Through this review, we identify the main streams of Green IS-related studies that have been undertaken within both practice and academia, and offer a holistic picture of the current state of research/interest in Green IS. We then identify the overlaps and differences between the two sides (that is, academia and practice) in an attempt to unearth noticeable similarities/gaps between both perspectives.

It reveals how the disaster management system in Cameroon influences the management style and process with regards to the technical and socio-economic management of LND. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research methods for empirical and secondary data were adopted in the study, including interviews (with disaster managers and LND survivors) and reviews of policy documents and media reports. Triangulation of information sources in the analysis has been done to enhance credibility. Findings: While significant progress has been made in technical management of LND, the socio-economic management has been poor. Although this can be partly attributed to the weak financial situation of Cameroon, the major problems seem to be related to human systems. Practical implications: The disaster management has focused mainly on technical and structural mitigation measures with less consideration of non-structural measures. This has had dire consequences for the displaced disaster survivors. A major challenge still lies in tackling social vulnerability within the displaced disaster population. Originality/value: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of contemporary challenges facing the management of LND. This paper is important because published information on socio-economic aspects of LND is very scarce.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, samples were selected from the legislative election of 2008 conducted in Taiwan, and focused on the candidates' competition strategies in the five major cities with the highest population density in Taiwan. Findings: The findings in this study indicate that the relationship among the three main external networks supports the curvilinear effect for gathering fundraising activities/contributions for the election. However, the impact of the number of votes obtained only reveals positive statistical significance on the part of individuals, not of firms and groups, despite the indication of a positive relationship. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is that only the election of members for the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan is used. The study could be further extended to look into other types of elections, such as the election of representatives and councilors for the counties and also the presidential election. A comparative analysis for different types of elections could also be performed to find out whether there are any other different implications for the election strategies. Practical implications: It is realized only through members' levels of collective goal orientation and shared trust, which create value by facilitating successful collective action.

Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on 25 thematic interviews with small business owner-managers. The data analysis is based on a method of qualitative content analysis. Findings - Based on the analysis, it is shown that reactivity, an emphasis on personal interests, the willingness to utilize philanthropy as part of marketing and lack of planning are typical of philanthropy in the small business context. Small businesses often emphasize strategic business reasons as the main motive for their philanthropic engagements. Nevertheless, in some cases the philanthropic decisions are based on mere willingness to contribute to the welfare of others. Thus, the paper suggests that there is room for altruism in the small business context. The existence of altruism in the context of small business philanthropy is closely related to owner-managers' values and business ambitions. Indeed, the organizational context does not usually hinder the existence of altruism to any great extent among small businesses, as it might do in the large business context. Similarly, based on the results of this study, the authors suggest that close relationships between a small business and its stakeholders increase the probability of altruism in business.

They are, however, quite consistent with an alternative stakeholder ""model"" of management and governance. Several implications of this political point are developed. These include the near-total overlap of business ethics, politics and economics, as well as the (classically) pragmatic notion that the products of the synthetic biology industry will eventually co-create their own ethics, or future-ethics.

To be socially responsible means, beyond compliance with applicable regulations, in a rigorous and continuous manner, a voluntary and continual concern of the company with investments in human capital, in environment management, and stakeholders' relationship management. The paper aims to investigate multiple conceptions and definitions of social responsibility and social entrepreneurship using an extensive review of the recent specialized literature. Also, to get a clear understanding of the meanings of the two concepts, various good practices of organizations demonstrating social responsibility have been researched, using information available on their web pages and other specialized sites. The paper explains the determinants that influence the companies' socially responsible behavior and the dimensions of social responsibility. The social entrepreneurship term is also examined through the perspective of the criteria against which the social impact of the company is assessed. Furthermore, the similarities and differences between the two concepts are inquired, as well as the steps that a socially responsible company is to take to become a social entrepreneurial organization. The paper suggests that a company which integrates social and environment objectives into its key processes and its interaction with stakeholders is more likely to be more competitive on the market and to contribute successfully to the sustainable socio-economic growth of the local community in which it operates.","Companies; Social entrepreneurial organization; Social entrepreneurship; Social responsibility; Social value",

Three ways to 'sense' change are compared: following trends, issues and events; picking up signals from stakeholders; and adjusting to sustainable development as a specific definition of 'progress'. The paper discusses the merits and limits of each approach. Conclusions are drawn in terms of implications for managing CR.

Applying advanced financial models to a uniquely constructed panel dataset, we demonstrate that a significant overall CSP-CFP relationship exists and that this relationship is, in part, conditioned on firms' industry-specific context. To accommodate the estimation of time-invariant industry and industry-interaction effects, we estimate linear mixed models in our test of the CSP-CFP relationship. Our results show both a significant overall CSP effect as well as significant industry effects between CSP and CFP. In conflict with expectations, the unweighted average effect of CSP on CFP is negative. Our industry analysis, however, shows that in over 17% of the industries in our sample, the effect of CSP on CFP for socially responsible firms is positive. We also examine the multidimensional nature of the CSP construct in an industry context by exploring the CSP dimension-industry nexus and identify dimensions of social performance that are associated with either better or worse financial performance. Our results confirm the existence of disparate CSP dimension-industry effects on CFP, thus our results provide important and actionable information to decision makers considering whether and how to commit corporate resources to social performance. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate financial performance; Corporate social performance; Linear mixed model; Panel data analysis; Residual income model",

While Christian vocation discourse may seem to represent one extreme of Divine transcendence, and Confucian tianming discourse may seem equally extreme in conveying the logic of immanence, there is considerable overlap between the two - or so I will argue in this paper. There are significant patterns of immanence in Christian vocation discourse and conversely significant indications of transcendence in Confucian tianming. Furthermore in their respective intellectual traditions, the two terms have been progressively universalized, so that Christian vocation no longer symbolizes a religious life withdrawn from the world, and Confucian tianming no longer can be regarded as exclusive to the Emperor as ""tianzi"" or Son of Heaven. To be sure, the ultimate meaning of each term depends on the reality of God in Biblical religion, on the one hand, and the significance of Heaven in Chinese culture, and there are irreducible, non-negotiable differences between these two. Nevertheless, there is a degree of overlap that remains very promising for clarifying the basis for a universal humanism whose emergence in a Global Ethic is one of the defining characteristics of our time. I hope to show the promise of this emerging consensus about the ultimately spiritual presuppositions regarding our common humanity and its importance for the field of international business ethics. Beginning with Max Weber's seminal work on The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1904), the significance of Christian vocation discourse for business ethics within a capitalist political economy has been commonly recognized. The burden of my paper is to show that an ethic of ""tianming"" might be equally significant in a Confucian perspective on international business ethics. Without a solid foundation recognizing a depth-dimension to human nature, programs of business ethics will not succeed in having a positive impact on the ways in which we can and must do business together.This paper is an expansion of the argument I sketched in an essay published in the Journal of International Business Ethics (Volume 3, Number 2, 2010), ""Business Ethics in Christian Social Teaching and Confucian Moral Philosophy: Two Ships Passing in the Night?""

In our contemporary industrialized society, the dominant system for organizing work is corporate capitalism, which, as we see it, is neither inherently good nor bad. Corporate capitalism, however, has been infused with a normative faith that gives primacy to profit maximization and personal enrichment, and in so doing opens the door to corrupting forces that debase business.

However, the predominant view of stakeholders that many marketers advocate is still primarily pragmatic and company centric. The position advanced herein is that stronger forms of stakeholder marketing that reflect more normative, macro/societal, and network-focused orientations are necessary. The authors briefly explain and justify these characteristics in the context of the growing ""prosociety"" and ""proenvironment"" perspectives-orientations that are also in keeping with the public policy focus of this journal.

Among the small businesses in the UK that are proving this belief to be a folk myth is Waste King, a specialist collections, clearance and recycling company serving both domestic and commercial markets. It focuses not only on providing a friendly, efficient, cost-effective service but also one that is environmentally friendly. In particular, Waste King's Environment Agency licensed staff take time to ensure that the maximum amount of waste can be recycled and that all the waste it collects is disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.

This development, in part, is meant to position Sydney as a globalizing city, at the centre of financial services in the Asia Pacific region. The article uses Clegg's ideas of 'circuits of power' to develop an analytical framework and employs a qualitative, case study approach based on a wide range of documents and media reports in the public domain. It addresses the processes of public management in the Barangaroo development, focusing on strategic agenda setting and leadership; organizing by rules; contract relations; no-cost-to government policy; organizing by precedent, especially those embedded in institutional responsibilities and responses; and stakeholder management. It demonstrates that at each stage in the process these have been characterized less by the rhetoric of public management and more by a disorganization of this rhetoric by a complex politics flowing through distinct circuits of power. The critical finding is that public management in the context of a large economic infrastructure development, especially when government is attempting to position a city globally, is far more complex and political than the prevailing rhetoric of the New Public Management, of considered rationality, would suggest. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Barangaroo; circuits of power; NSW government; projects; Public management",

I then examine the scope of the top management journals, showing how their empirical and descriptive focus leaves little room for ethics, which is an essentially conceptual and prescriptive discipline.

The emerging duplicity in tax haven-based companies professing social responsibility highlights once more the political nature of CSR, where at least some firms and/or industries can successfully limit government power to enact regulation as well as shape the discourse around CSR.

Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high.

This is attempted largely through a consideration of academic literature, supported by some empirical findings from a research investigation into higher education and social work in Sweden and England and a review of literature that reveals varying types of leadership characterized as masculinist. Taking the position that context shapes social relationships and subject positions, and provides opportunities as well as constraints, we consider leadership in the public sector under the sway of new public management, framed by neo-liberalism and the valorization of competition, self-interested instrumentality, uncertainty and risk, operationalized in public sector organizations through performative regimes. It is argued that while some women and men are willing participants in the new regimes, others are antagonistic or ambivalent, finding themselves mired in neo-bureaucratic processes of surveillance and control, often stuck in occupational cul-de-sacs. It is contended that neo-liberalism and new public management are associated with masculinist forms of rationality that elevate individual winners and losers and divert attention from collective issues of gender. Rather than focus on gendered styles of leadership it is suggested that it is more important to look at their gendered performance and effects.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used was a survey of 496 employees from 15 organizations across ten industries. Findings: Affective trust in colleagues moderates the relationship between affective commitment and knowledge sharing and the relationship between cost of knowledge sharing and knowledge sharing. Research limitations/implications: Future researchers should operationalize the perceived cost of knowledge sharing construct to include other potential group barriers; for instance, politics and organizational barriers, management commitment and lack of trust. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that employees who value social relationships and social resources tend to view knowledge as a collectively owned commodity.

This should be understood in the light of the way owner-managers develop identity from their business, and a better understanding is needed to develop preventive programmes that fit the owner-managers' interpretation of the working environment. Qualitative interviews were carried out with the owner-managers or the managers responsible for the working environment in 23 small firms from the construction and metal industries. The interviews were analysed for attitudes on the working environment, understanding of risk, responsibility for the working environment, and attitudes towards regulation. The analysis revealed both a great heterogeneity of views on the working environment and groups of owners who share important characteristics. Most owner-managers take a positive approach to the working environment, but also try to 'talk risk down', criticize regulation as bureaucracy and push a part of the employer responsibility on to the employees. They try to follow what they experience as a generally acceptable standard for the working environment among the stakeholders in the sector, but some owner-managers also tend to neglect the working environment. The reason for the down grading of risk and the push to share responsibility can be found in the close social relationships and the identity work processes of the owner-managers with their business. They try to act as decent people and thus avoid personal guilt and blame if employees should get injured. © The Author(s) 2011.","identity work; occupational health and safety; self-protection; small firm; working environment",

While innovation is regarded as the answer, the companies can effectively measure the return on R&D investment, have acceptable product success rates, achieve acceptable promotional effectiveness, or have visibility into their compliance risks or operational readiness for new product launches. Companies must have repeatable, compliant and responsive business processes, global ICT information infrastructure that provides a single source of the truth, alignment across departments and solutions that evolve without coding. With holistic strategy and supporting infrastructure, companies can consistently minimize the time to scale, improve product success rates and promotional effectiveness, and enjoy sustainable and profitable growth. The companies must first focus on the needs of their customer, continually minimize time to scale, eliminate waste, drive out costs and improve. These are core concepts of a Lean strategy.

It is based upon a case study of an International Canadian coffee and donut chain: Tim Hortons. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through: extensive publications of corporate documents, observations of actual operations at retail sites and social media sites. Findings: The paper finds that Tim Hortons has clearly made progress toward greater sustainability. However, its program often lacks specificity, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Within a visibly and highly polluting industry Tim Hortons sustainability program is a step in the right direction but there are areas in need of improvement. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study paradoxically suggest that it is difficult for a company in the fast food industry to truly become sustainable given certain characteristics of the industry (disposal food and beverage containers, and drive-thrus for example), yet sustainability is also imperative to business success and competitiveness. Practical implications: Through a detailed examination of Tim Hortons' sustainable business approach the authors delineate a number of areas where the company can improve its sustainability. The paper also discusses areas of difficulty (e.g. drive-thrus) and areas in need of improvement (e.g. a detailed description of the sources of the company's greenhouse-gas emissions). Social implications: Tim Hortons' sustainability program was only recently launched, and although the motivations behind the program are not discussed, it was not developed in response to any government subsidies or legislation. Originality/value: The main contributions are as follows. First, the authors methodically analyze the sustainable business approach of a Canadian fast-food company including but not limited to its value-added process, driving forces, and purchasing policies. This provides a beginning for others who wish to implement sustainability into an industry not known for its environmental responsibility. Second, the authors suggest ways that Tim Hortons could improve its sustainable business approach.

This study demonstrates that the impact of price differentials on counterfeit purchases varies according to the perceived corporate citizenship (PCC) image of the original brand. When consumers perceive the legitimate brand to be high in corporate citizenship (high PCC), the extent of the price differential does not affect consumers' purchase intentions toward the counterfeit. However, when the legitimate brand has a negative image (low PCC), higher price differentials trigger significantly greater intentions to purchase the counterfeit product. This moral profiteering effect indicates that consumers are more likely to purchase counterfeits when they have both economic and moral justifications for their unethical actions.

As economies globalize, so do politics and stakeholder expectations that MNCs must negotiate as they manage their global operations.

Yet, in fulfilling these functions, CR may need to be highly sensitive to local contexts. How can transnational firms organize CR so as to maximize efficiencies from globalization and to minimize the fragmentation of corporate organizational cultures? provide a framework for analyzing the way that corporations coordinate global and local functions. We build on this framework in a case study of Novo Nordisk and its approach to determining global and local CR policies and procedures with regard to its China and US subsidiaries. Our findings suggest that it is important for companies to define a common set of organizational norms.

But to what extent are these intentions and goals actually realized? Are corporations able and willing to implement GFAs in a joint effort together with the unions across a vastly diverse range of institutional settings and national arrangements? And do GFAs have an influence on core elements of a company's business policy decisions? Drawing on the insights from an interdisciplinary and multinational project, this paper uses four case studies to explore the conditions and variations in GFA implementation in the USA. Although we observe, as have others before us, that key matters of business strategy such as investments, acquisitions, restructuring, or relocation are more centralized than corporate policies on labor relations, we provide some evidence that the implementation of GFAs can be moved forward by a confluence of external actor involvement and of corporate strategies motivated by a desire to streamline HRM practices (that include the goals covered by GFAs in their core business practices). This finding of the influence of external actor voice in implementation processes may also have broader explanatory power with respect to CR initiatives in general. And in theoretical terms it allows us to explore the interplay between macro structural explanations like the Varieties of Capitalism approach, and the strategic ""micro-political"" explanations.

It is contended that network partnership characteristics of commitment, equity, mutuality, and trust together with network behavior will vary by the degree of publicness but collectively contribute in a positive manner towards the performance of SD projects. Data were collected from members of 28 SD advisory committees/representative organizations (a 57% response rate) and resulted in a usable dataset of 53 SD projects. Results of analysis indicate that government, business, and civil society SD project members do not perceive major differences between partnership characteristics and perceived project performance but do in relation to network behavior. Multiple regression analysis suggests that trust contributes towards perceived project performance, as do the network behavior characteristics of private sector and civil society group actors; however, for the latter group, network behavior is negatively correlated with project performance.

It is widely known that innovation adoption success is largely dependent on user commitment and absorption of the innovation in work processes. However, the hardest task for any person interested in innovation implementation activities is how to achieve high levels of commitment and acceptance of those stakeholders that matter the most. In this article, we argue that much can be gained by having good insights in indicators of both influence and acceptance of stakeholders during innovation implementation and adoption phases; the so-called stakeholder dynamics. To gain insights in a stakeholder's potential influence and potential acceptance of the innovation during the innovation implementation project, we argue that stakeholder capacity and intentions are key characteristics. By reviewing relevant theoretical foundations relating to innovation implementation, technology acceptance and stakeholder theory, we argue that literature considering the combination of both capacity as well as intentions in an integrated evaluation model is scarce. In this article, we are presenting a synthesized model and methodology for the iterative evaluation of stakeholder dynamics during innovation implementations; the stakeholder-based innovation acceptance web (SIAW). Insights in the combination of capacity and intentions dimensions can help in focussing and matching engagement strategies.

Thus, laissez-faire capitalism, as exemplified by the mortgage banking meltdown of 2008 and subsequent debt-based unemployment crisis, has not only impoverished millions, destroyed savings and bankrupted long-established investment firms, but also has further bonded the perpetrators to the morally undeveloped self-centredness of Lawrence Kohlberg's least advanced moral stage (Kohlberg, 1981).

The images of humanitarian organisations distributing food and medicines under the protection of military forces, or aid workers and military working together to construct refugee camps, set up field hospitals, provide emergency water and sanitation, has become more frequent. The media coverage from natural and man-made disasters in recent years, has heightened the expectation of a smooth interaction between humanitarian organisations and military forces. Due to fundamental differences between international military forces, humanitarian and development organisations (in terms of the principles and doctrines guiding their work, their agendas, operating styles, and roles), the area of civil military coordination in disaster relief has proven to be more difficult than other interagency relationships. In order to address this, the authors outline the usage of systems analysis and design technique (SADT) to explain how a more effective coordination of humanitarian operations by military and civilian organisations involved in disaster relief can be achieved across the range of humanitarian aid lifecycle phases. Furthermore the authors provide an empirical comparison of military and humanitarian organisation partnership evaluation criteria for (CIMIC). Finally, the authors then develop and present how the SADT approach can inform the development of a systems dynamics model using systems archetypes (SA) to describe the rich interactions between stakeholders and involved components. The authors propose a framework which identifies these facets as a result. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The authors contend that the two existing archetypes - the noble peasant farmer and the independent artisan - and the emerging archetype of the ""empowered decision maker"" serve to obscure and mask complex labour relationships. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper draws on a wide range of literature and original fieldwork conducted by the authors to illustrate the three marketing archetypes in the fair trade value chain. Findings: Hidden behind the three dominant archetypes used to promote fair trade is a relationship between fair trade ""producers"" (small farmer, craft enterprise and plantations) and permanent and temporary/casual labourers. The trickle-down of fair trade benefits to these workers is uneven at best and falls far short of the expectation of empowerment of all ""producers"" that fair trade promises. Research limitations/implications: The fair trade project must look beyond the simple archetypes to engage more deeply with labour issues in the fair trade value chain, and to re-engage with fair trade as a development strategy through which broader and more complex forms of empowerment can be realised. Practical implications: Fair trade standards are not a substitute for organised labour's activities. Interactions between trade unions and fair trade bodies could ensure that existing labour standards are met, and improvements in the lives of all workers can occur. Originality/value: This paper conceptualises three fair trade mainstream marketing archetypes and suggests why and how the fair trade movement must move beyond these to ensure empowerment amongst its least well-off stakeholders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Archetypes; Business ethics; Fair trade; International trade; Labour rights; Mainstreaming; Marketing",

They also face complex challenges in managing citizens' perceptions of the effectiveness of services to continually improve their resulting quality of life. We view urban areas as dynamic sociocultural systems, meaning that effectively and dynamically understanding and addressing their challenges means confronting the full complexity of factors that interact to make up the system. More precisely, we understand these systems to be complex service systems, arrangements of multiple entities and stakeholders that interact to co-create value. Decision makers of urban centers face the design problem of arranging the entities so that the most mutual value emerges from their interactions. To analyze and understand such complex systems, we suggest a new approach to service system analysis based on model composition to design and evaluate stakeholder relationships through what-if scenarios. Applied to the intriguing real-world scenario of crime and perceptions of crime in the London Borough of Sutton, we show how service system analysis - analyzing value constellations to find opportunities for reconfiguring roles and relationships that unlock value - can be applied to a sociocultural service system by focusing on the complex relationship among components that can influence complex questions, such as safety and quality-of-community.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on research with four SFTEs in Bangladesh, taking an ethnographic approach with qualitative methodologies such as semi-structured interviews, recorded meetings, informal discussions, analysis of grey literature, and observation with managers, staff, field workers and artisans of the organisations. Findings: The meanings of Fair Trade are located in personal, family, business and national understandings of fairness and development. Such meanings inform the business practices of the SFTEs, used to achieve both commercial success and social goals, confirming the role of SFTEs in creating and maintaining ideals of fairer trade. Research limitations/implications: There is a need for more research on Fair Trade from the perspective of SFTEs. Practical implications: The research draws attention to the key roles and business practices of the SFTE, increasing the understanding of what happens in the name of Fair Trade, and also provides lessons for other socially responsible enterprises. Social implications: The research highlights the importance of Southern meanings and practices, which should be included in the conceptualisation of Fair Trade, thus facilitating both informed debate and understanding the possibilities for the promotion and extension of fairer trade.

One organization at the forefront of the debate is Trade Aid (NZ), Inc. (hereafter Trade Aid), a New Zealand based socially orientated fair trade organization actively engaged in fair trade since the 1970s. This paper seeks to evaluate how Trade Aid is seeking to reformulate fair trade's vision of empowerment and partnership constructively. Design/methodology/approach: A single case study approach is undertaken to examine how a socially orientated organization is adhering to and seeking to advance fair trade values. This research draws from the global value chain literature, which analyses how industries are governed. The relational co-ordination or governance mode, which is characteristic of mutual dependency between supplier and buyer firms, is used as a framework for investigating the fair trade industry. Distinction is made between the corporate and social economy variants of the relational governance mode. Findings: Trade Aid's commitment to producer groups is demonstrated through various initiatives the organization is undertaking as they work both with producer groups and corporate actors to expand the fair trade market. Trade Aid is part of a worldwide socially orientated movement seeking to reformulate the vision of fair trade.

After reviewing the contributions made to business ethics by these two philosophers, we propose four phases necessary to the emergence and constitution of a moral subject in organizations: self-awakening, self-evaluation, selftransformation and self-presentation. We then suggest various managerial practices and behaviour inspired by this philosophical parrhesia embodied by the Greek philosopher wherein the manager should have a personal relationship with his or her own activity.

Design/methodology/approach: In the absence of empirical work linking internal marketing efforts in organizations and employee engagement in corporate responsibility issues, a conceptual approach based on literature review is carried out to determine the existing possibilities provided by internal marketing to enhance corporate responsibility. Findings: Reflexion from the extant literature indicates that, because employee engagement matters, internal responsibility should be put first. The internal marketing umbrella, including ""selling internally"" the idea of responsibility, facilitating internal communication, enhancing corporate volunteering or the possibility to become a social intrapreneur, could help to align employees' needs with corporate responsibility goals. Practical implications: The results suggest that managers must ensure that internal aspects of management, such as internal communication and employee commitment are taken into account in order to get success in corporate responsibility issues. Managers need to be more proactive trying to introduce the marketing function in human capital issues. Understanding employees' wants and needs and selling internally responsibility goals would make external efforts in developing a responsible strategy much more likely to succeed.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an empirical study of CSRD in 2009-2010, using content analysis, Cronbach's α, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality and a six point scale (0-5), mean, skewness, kurtosis, and Levene's, Kruskal-Wallis's and Mood's median tests for analysis and interpretation. Findings - CSRD shows less satisfactory social performance, mainly narrative, and varies significantly among items and themes. Community development, with a mean score of 14.30, is the most disclosed theme, followed by HR, with a score of 11.20. The human element is the center of social performance in India.

The findings support that CSP investment is interpreted by loan officers as an indicator of superior corporate financial performance. However, no clear positive relationship between innovation intensity and lending decisions was found. These results are consistent with the view that lenders could be reluctant to fund innovation intensity initiatives because there may be a considerable time lag between this investment and its payoff.

So what is this term doing in respect to global business practices and corporate affairs? This question is the one the book sets out to explore. The argument is that with the advent of globalization - where corporate organizations and the commercial relations that accompany them are argued to have become increasingly transnational - the locus of powers, authorities, and responsibilities has shifted to the global level. The nation-state arena is losing its capacity to regulate and control commercial processes and practices as a transformational logic kicks-in, associated with new forms of global rule making and governance. And it is this new arena of global rule making can be considered as a surrogate form of global constitutionalization, or 'quasi-constitutionalization'. But as might be expected, this surrogate process of constitutionalization is not a coherent program or a set of rounded outcomes but is full of contradictory half-finished currents and projects: an 'assemblage' of many disparate advances and often directionless moves - almost an accidental coming together of elements. Thus, the book is about governance, law, and constitutional matters. these are discussed in the context of international corporate constitutional governance. So, the emphasis is upon how and why the business world, commercial relations, and particularly company activities have increasingly become subject to legal and constitutional forms of regulation and governance at the international level. The questions asked is how to characterize the process that has seen the international corporate sphere increasingly subject to juridical and constitutional-like regulatory initiatives and interventions. Does this amount to a new attempt to subject international commercial relations to the 'rule by law' and, indeed, to rule the world through these very means?. © Grahame Thompson 2012.

Design/methodology/approach: The new proposed model is based on an empirical study that comprises an exploratory study based on 15 interviews and a confirmatory study based on 684 questionnaires answered by staff of 11 public universities. The main variable deployed is the stakeholder's respective level of influence from the organization's management perspective, that is, their level of legitimacy, power and urgency. Findings: The new model proposes six stakeholder types (regulator, controller, partner, passive, dependent and non-stakeholder). To explain the relationship between the stakeholder and the organization, the traditional needs-satisfaction vision was expanded. The variables of relevance, mutual influence and participation were found to be important in explaining the organization and stakeholder relationship. This study contributes both in simplifying stakeholder classification and in explaining the relationships between parties.

Findings: The results indicate that CSP influences consumer-firm emotional attachment and that this attachment constitutes an unrecognized mediational pathway in the CSP-loyalty link. The results identify the moderating and strengthening role of altruism, need-for-activity, and esteem-enhancement on the CSP-emotional attachment link. Finally, the study reveals that attributions are likely to moderate the influence of consumer altruism. Research limitations/implications: Although the CSP record scenarios reflected real corporate social responsibility practices, future studies employing field experiments or consumer surveys exploring the effects of actual corporate social responsibility initiatives would be valuable to enhance the external validity of these results. Practical implications: The study helps retailers towards improved and more targeted social responsibility investments. Specifically, retailers targeting consumer groups that are high in altruism, high in need for activity, and high in self-enhancement motives are probably in a more advantageous position when investing in CSR initiatives as a way to build and further deepen emotional attachment, and indirectly consumer loyalty. Originality/value: Building on the CSR and attachment literatures, the study investigates the extent to which CSP is capable of influencing customer loyalty through emotion-laden processes. Furthermore, in contrast to previous CSR studies, this study is one of the first to directly investigate whether consumer differences influence consumer reactions to CSR. Specifically, this study finds that differences in consumers' personality traits may affect the effectiveness of CSR initiatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Altruism; Consumer behaviour; Corporate social performance; Emotional attachment; Esteem enhancement; Market segmentation; Need for activity",

Among the three pillars of sustainability consisting of environmental, social and economic longevity and foresight of a firm, we focus on the environmental component. Specifically, basing our arguments on the resource-based view of the firm, we hypothesize the impact of environmental management on plant performance. Environmental initiatives considered include ISO 14000 certification, pollution prevention, recycling of materials, and waste reduction; plant performance is assessed with the dimensions of the four competitive capabilities of quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost. Further, building on the theory of performance frontiers, we investigate these relationships across plants located in different economic regions of the world (plants are classified into emerging, developing and industrialized regions). We suggest that recent emphasis on these environmental initiatives has been greatest among plants located in emerging economies, compared to their counterparts in industrialized and developing nations. In addition, we contend that the influence of these initiatives is greatest for plants located in emerging and developing economies when compared to plants in industrialized nations. These notions are tested with data collected from 1211 plants located in these three economic regions.

In particular, based on the five-dimensional structure of LSR framework, we propose that clan culture, business ethics, pressures from customers, suppliers, competitors and law/regulations are important antecedents of five dimensions of LSR. A mail survey was conducted in China and a total of 162 firm-level questionnaires were returned. Structural equation modeling was employed to test our theory. The results support our hypotheses that clan culture and business ethics of a firm have significant impacts on all the five dimensions of LSR.

When large companies flourish, the smaller ones in the chain also prosper. Companies in United States and worldwide (particularly the ones with overvalued currencies) have outsourced their manufacturing and assembly tasks to countries of undervalued currencies for their affordable labors and materials, and for the countries current and potential consumption powers. [Note that undervalued currencies are good in their respective local purchases of labor and material but otherwise can only be exchanged for smaller number of other overvalued currencies.] We say such practices follow the gravity rule, a condition derived from monetary economics for cross-border trade. The results are piles of cash earned in companies of blockbuster products, only at the cost of shrinking number of payroll checks and increased governments' welfare checks to the unemployed. When the population falls into the rich and poor extremes, the burden of welfare checks falls upon governments which are often already burdened by worsening fiscal deficits. How should we create incentives (e.g., providing tax credit on net job creation) for cash-rich manufacturing companies to enter into service and retailing sectors to help boost home country employment? We can relate the corporate governance performance (and management compensations) to the unwanted laying-off behaviors; and better still we can promote the practice of extending the domestic service tier (to compensate the job loss caused by globalized manufacturing operations). The service tier may open up opportunities of hiring additional workers. We propose a two-stage conceptual model to uncover and feature the successes of Apple Computers and Sees' Candies; and to contrast such successes with the dilemma faced by Volvo Cars prior to its ownership shift in 2008.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a review of the literature in HRD and related fields, and of curricula of a sample of HRD programs in the USA. Findings: Five themes were found in the academic literature: critique of HRD's fixation with performance outcomes and lack of emphasis on developing sustainable and responsible members of society; role of HRD in embedding sustainability in organizational cultures; training and development methods, aimed at increasing sustainability awareness and at developing related skills; sustainable leadership and leadership development; and interconnectedness of HRD, sustainability, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and business ethics. Review of the contents of a sample of HRD graduate programs suggested that these programs rarely incorporate sustainability-focused courses or course segments. Research limitations/implications: Future research needs to conduct an in-depth review and analysis of the existing HRD graduate coursework in a larger sample of HRD programs to determine the extent of coverage of sustainability-related topics. In addition, a review of the literature from related fields (e.g. business and management, HRM, and engineering), is needed to identify successful examples of sustainability-related curricular innovations. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to conduct action research-based studies of experimental development and implementation of courses and/or teaching modules, focused on sustainability issues. Practical implications: There are three main areas where changes in HRD curricula are needed: economic foundations of HRD (to demonstrate the economic necessity of the paradigm change); systems theory (to provide a solid understanding of the systemic nature of inter-relationships between the economy, environment, and society); and self-leadership and individual moral development as related to individual employees' role in promoting sustainable organizations. Originality/value: While there is some research on the role of HRD in organizational sustainability, this article is the first to address issues of corresponding changes in HRD academic curricula. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic growth; Future of human resource development; Human resource development; Human resource development curriculum; Organizations; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Sustainable organizations",

It draws on an ethnographic study of human resource managers in a global organization to provide a theorized account of situated moral agency. This account suggests that within contemporary organizations, institutional structures-particularly the structures of Anglo-American market capitalism-threaten and constrain the capacity of HR managers to exercise moral agency and hence engage in ethical behaviour. The contextualized explanation of HR management action directly addresses the question of whether HRM is inherently unethical. The discussion draws on MacIntyre's (Philosophy 74:311-329, 1999, After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory, Duckworth, 2000) conceptualization of moral agency within contemporary social structures. In practice, HR managers embody roles that may not be wholly compartmentalized. Alternative institutional structures can provide HR managers with a vocabulary of motives for people-centred HRM and widen the scope for the exercising of moral agency, when enacted within reflective relational spaces that provide milieus for critical questioning of logics and values. This article aims to contribute to and extend debate on whether HRM can ever be ethical, and provide a means of reconnecting business ethics with longstanding concerns in critical management studies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Human resource management; Institutional theory; Moral agency; Relational sociology; Relational spaces",

They seem committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices that are aimed at preventing or minimising the harm associated with their activities. Our empirical research employed a sample of 209 university student online gamblers, who took part in an online survey. Our findings suggest that the extent of online problem gambling is substantial and that it adversely impacts on the gambler's mental and physical health, social relationships and academic performance. Online problem gambling seems to be related to the time spent on the Internet and gambling online, parental/peer gambling and binge drinking. As our findings show that there are harmful repercussions associated with online gambling, we argue that companies in this controversial sector cannot reach the higher level of CSR achieved by other industries. Nevertheless, they can gain legitimacy on the basis of their CSR engagement at a transactional level, and so, by meeting their legal and ethical commitments and behaving with transparency and fairness, the integrity of the company can be ensured. We also argue that current failures in the implementation and control of CSR policies, the reliance on revenue from problem gamblers' losses, and controversial marketing activities appear to constitute the main obstacles in the prevention or minimisation of harm related to online gambling. As online gambling companies must be responsible for the harm related to their activities, we suggest that CSR policies should be fully implemented, monitored and clearly reported; all forms of advertising should be reduced substantially; and unfair or misleading promotional techniques should be banned. The industry should not rely on revenue from problem gamblers, nor should their behaviour be reinforced by marketing activities (i. e. rewards). We realise, however, that it is unrealistic to expect the online gambling industry to prioritise harm prevention over revenue maximisation. Policy makers and regulators, therefore, would need to become involved if the actions suggested above are to be undertaken. CSR is paramount to minimise harm and provide a healthier user experience in this business sector, but it also poses marketing dilemmas. We support a global collaborative approach for the online gambling industry, as harm related to gambling is a public health issue. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CSR and gambling addiction; CSR in controversial industries; CSR in online gambling; Marketing activities in the online gambling industry",

Following this perspective, we propose ethnography as a methodological imperative in public relations research that seeks to develop descriptive inferences about the influence of an organization's culture on its social ecology. The ethnographic imperative in research design is derived from two interlocked, epistemological commitments in research design. First, a view that the culture of an organization is constituted as a system of shared knowledge that is socially transmitted over time among organizational members. Second, as a consequence, the cognitive setting for actor-based models of organizational social relationships and imperatives is cultural in nature. Based on these commitments, ethnography as a methodological imperative is specifically enjoined when research derived from cocreational public relations theories is explicitly set in sociocultural analysis of those organizations. The strength of this ethnographic imperative in research design is reflected by the degree of congruency between the descriptive inferences drawn from ethnographic data and the theoretical context within which such inferences are situated. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Ethnography; Methodology; Organizational culture; Public relations; Social ecology",

Individuals attach crucial importance to the perceived fairness of relationship partners which serves as a signal as to whether the relationship is viable or not. At the same time, fairness issues are sometimes controversial. For example, how do contradictory fairness rules influence reward allocation? Such contradictions of rules constitute a problem both in philosophical treatments of moral action and in the social psychology of fairness. In the context of performance, the application of one of two fairness rules appears reasonable: equity and equality. Either the allocators focus on only one of these normative rules or they attempt to generate a compromise between both rules. The reward expectation hypothesis which is part of expectation states theory offers a solution to this problem: It delineates a formula which allows an estimation of the impact of equity and equality for a given reward allocation among a known number of group members whose relative performances are quantified. The use of the formula is explained on the basis of empirical data obtained in a scenario study in which the performances of group members were depicted as unequal. Results indicate that the formula generates valid estimates of weights which represent the relative impact of equity and equality on reward allocation. In addition, the reward expectation hypothesis offers a new interpretation of the reconstruction of performance distributions on the basis of a known reward distribution. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The new hotel creates economic value to Auckland Airport as it is expected to generate considerable long term tourism revenue to the company. Additionally, it can stimulate economic growth and employment for the Auckland region as its proximity to the largest airport in the country attracts airline crews and transit passengers, and the hotel offers meeting facilities for MICE tourism.

Using an analytical framework based on a synthesis of theories of network and stakeholder management, three cases in road infrastructure in Queensland, Australia are examined.

In 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SoX) was created. Accordingly, under the rules of SoX, U.S. corporations were faced with increased oversight and also needed to substantially improve their internal controls. As companies began to scrutinize their internal affairs more closely, some businesses detected other forms of criminal activity occurring internally, such as bribery. Those companies and individuals found to have committed bribery have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA). Throughout this paper, a plausible correlation between SoX and a recent increase in reported violations of the FCPA will be assessed. This possibility is evaluated via a presentation of cases involving multinational corporations that have been found to have violated the FCPA. Based on the authors' research, a pattern does exist between SoX and the enforcement of the FCPA.

The MSIM framework consists of three strategic levels: attraction, integration and management of stakeholder involvement. Six stages are embedded within the three levels: scene-setting, recognition of stakeholder involvement capacity, stakeholder relationship management, pursuit of achievable objectives, influencing implementation capacity and monitoring stakeholder involvement. These are supported by the overarching notion of 'hand-holding' and key actions [e.g. managing stakeholder adaptability] that enhance stakeholder involvement in ST. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Corporate financial performance might also be impacted by the effect of perceived CSR on consumer satisfaction. In this study, we present research on the contribution to consumer satisfaction of the perceived CSR of three car manufacturers in terms of labor practices, community development and environmental performance within a group of 329 Portuguese car buyers and users. These consumers valued environmental performance much more than activities related to labor practices and community development. However, determinants outside the realm of CSR, such as perceived product and service quality and empathy with the brand, were much more important for Portuguese consumers than CSR. The overall importance of CSR for consumer satisfaction suggests that in the automobile industry, CSR may not only contribute to better financial performance by directly reducing costs and increasing productivity but may also contribute indirectly by increasing consumer satisfaction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this systematic approach is to establish capability of its supply chain and manage their own intersections with their employees, society and the environment effectively and efficiently. Some of IBM's suppliers already incorporated an environmental management consistent with IBM's requirements. However, many suppliers did not. While some suppliers might argue that implementing a new management system could increase operating costs, other suppliers may suggest that effective environmental management provides financial benefits through operational efficiencies, cost avoidance, and other opportunities. IBM is itself, an example. Emphasising this situation, the case study brings forward the questions, ""Why would suppliers want to incorporate a formal management system? What are the advantages, strategic challenges and benefits of developing, communicating, and implementing the new management system, etc?"" Data for this case were collected from primary and secondary sources, which ensure that IBM is vigilant in protecting the environment across all of its operations worldwide. Findings in this case also reveal other issues that may influence the company and its suppliers' efforts.

The scope and scale of the global operations of multinational businesses means that decisions taken in different parts of the world have far reaching consequences beyond the national settings where employees are located or where firms are registered and as such, an awareness of these responsibilities needs to be integrated into all levels and all subjects. Using four guiding principles - a critical multi-level approach rooted in the tradition of European social theory, a comparative and international perspective, a global rather than just a European or American stand point and engaging with subject-specific issues this book aims to 'mainstream' business ethics into the work of teachers and students in business schools.

The Marists can point to years of productive service in their order. Generations of students know the impact he had on their lives. The St. John's University community can testify regarding his contributions to their institution, and organizational ethics researchers can point to his influence on research and pedagogy. Many academics have careers with achievements in research, teaching, and service. What made Father Primeaux truly remarkable, however, was that he also expanded the business ethics field itself. Business ethics has traditionally been a difficult area in which to establish a research niche. Pat's contributions to research and pedagogy, and particularly his efforts regarding the Vincentian Ethics Conferences opened doors for young business ethicists, which was enormously beneficial to those academics and increased the quality and quantity of business ethics research. This chapter examines Patrick Premeaux's groundbreaking contributions to business ethics teaching and research, and to demonstrate the impact those contributions have had on his fellow academicians. The first section outlines the significance of Primeaux's efforts. The second section examines Pat's contributions to business ethics research and education.

They explore new values for post-materialistic management: frugality, deep ecology, trust, reciprocity, responsibility for future generations, and authenticity. Within this framework profit and growth are no longer ultimate aims but elements in a wider set of values. Similarly, cost-benefit calculations are no longer the essence of management but are part of a broader concept of wisdom in leadership. Spirit-driven businesses require intrinsic motivation for serving the common good and using holistic evaluation schemes for measuring success.

The third, global age cosmopolitanism (GAC), is primarily socioeconomic and political, although it includes philosophical elements. Throughout this paper, the theoretical principles concerned with GAC will be discussed, however, it is important to first review its historical roots in SC and KC. The analysis also considers the relation of GAC to business ethics practice and business ethics education. Cosmopolitanism in the global age is different from the Stoic and Kantian cosmopolitanisms that have been endorsed by history.

In our work, we rely on the industrial/ organisational psychology literature to provide a starting point for categorising individual differences. Using the business ethics literature, we then develop a framework composed of three broad categories: cognitive skills, moral volition and personal values. We then provide examples within each category of the framework, and map these examples onto subcategories under each of the major categories.

This study attempts to identify the influence of supply chain stakeholders on sustainability of ports by considering the propositions of interdependencies, power imbalances, and strategic options within resource dependence theory. While this paper can be regarded as a review of port sustainability literature, the uniqueness lies on the consideration of the concept from the basis of resource dependence theory.

Corporate boards, aspiring to motivate executives to make value-maximizing decisions, often tie an executive's earnings to stock price performance through stock or option awards. However, this engenders a significant ethical dilemma for many executives who are uncomfortable with sizable, firm-specific risk and desire to reduce it through hedging activities. Recent research has shown that executive hedging has become more prevalent. In essence, managers are unwinding the acute economic incentive to act in the best interest of the owners. This appears to violate the spirit of the compensation contract and from a normative standpoint, is not how executives should act. In this article, we describe how some executives are acting in regard to this issue (descriptive ethics), how they should act (normative ethics) and how they can be helped to get from what they are doing, to what they should be doing (prescriptive ethics). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business Ethics; Ethics; Executive Compensation; Managerial Hedging",

Pat brought pop culture (e.g. Bruce Springsteen) (Primeaux, 1996) into business ethics precisely because he knew that culture shapes each of us in myriad ways, creating habits, expectations and outlooks we then bring to the workplace. In his book Reinterpreting the American Dream: Persons and Ethics, Pat showed how American culture encourages us to concentrate all of our energy into work and the pursuit of wealth and distinction (Primeaux, 2000). Pat also realized that institutions knowingly or unwittingly shape the kind of experiences individuals have and that these experiences directly inform our consciousness and, hence, our behaviour within organizations (Primeaux, 1992). A recent novel - A. D. Miller's Snowdrops - does a wonderful job of exploring psychic and cultural dynamics and in the process raises some troubling questions of where responsibility for wrongdoing lies. This essay uses Miller's book to explore from a psychological viewpoint how and why employees who are sent abroad by multinational corporations (MNCs) may get involved in local corruption; to show why personal integrity requires external support if agents are to be able to do the right thing; and to raise the issue of what sort of responsibilities MNCs have to the employees whom they send abroad.

Surprisingly, relatively little research has tied together these two trends. The present study integrates perspectives on stakeholder management with research on corporate political activity to develop an understanding of the structural sources of stakeholder mobilization in professional grassroots lobbying campaigns. This study employs a unique, original data source to consider how the adoption of grassroots lobbying by a firm relates to its industry, degree of inside lobbying, partisan PAC contributions, and more. This research shows that corporate grassroots lobbying is shaped most significantly by a firm's degree of inside lobbying, as highly active firms take a diversified strategy for gaining influence. Firms in industries with a heavy public presence as well as those concerned with taxation, government appropriations, and economic development also adopt these strategies readily. PAC contributions to Republican, but not Democratic, candidates also heighten firms' propensity to lobby the public. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","civic engagement; corporate political activity; political action committees; stakeholders, grassroots lobbying",

In Hungary, the area most affected is Health Care, where informal payments to medical staff are common. The article assesses the practice on ethical terms, focusing on organisational justice. It includes an analysis of distributional injustice, that is, of non-equitable payments to professionals, on the distribution of payments depending on the specialisation and status of the doctor, on his or her rights to allocate Health Care resources and/or on how assertive he or she is. We show, by means of a content analysis of internet postings and of interviews with physicians, the feelings and attitudes of both patients and doctors-thus enabling us to trace interactional and procedural injustice and portray the main driving forces of informal payment with causal loops. We use a new approach (a system dynamics computer simulation) to demonstrate how informal payments influence therapy procedures. The example of treating the common skin disease of psoriasis examines the specific behaviour of doctors in their everyday practice and estimates the extent to which the prescription of unnecessary or more expensive therapy increases the costs. With this multi-method approach, we demonstrate that the legislation allowing informal payment represents bad ethics, since it enforces organisational injustice, creates mistrust between physicians and patients, decreases performance and increases the total costs paid both by society and the Health Insurance Fund. Informal payments distort the allocation of resources, enforce discrimination based solely on money, violate the concept of solidarity and limit Human Rights in terms of health. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Computer simulation; Corruption; Health system; Informal payments; Organisational justice; System dynamics",

Such a social contract understanding of privacy could produce more practical guidance for organizations and managers who have employees, users, and future customers all with possibly different conceptions of privacy across contexts. However, this theoretical suggestion, while intuitively appealing, has not been empirically examined. This study validates a social contract approach to privacy by examining whether and how privacy norms vary across communities and contractors. The findings from this theoretical examination support the use of contractual business ethics to understand privacy in research and in practice. As predicted, insiders to a community had significantly different understandings of privacy norms as compared to outsiders. In addition, all respondents held different privacy norms across hypothetical contexts, thereby suggesting privacy norms are contextually understood within a particular community of individuals. The findings support two conclusions. First, individuals hold different privacy norms without necessarily having diminished expectations of privacy. Individuals differed on the factors they considered important in calculating privacy expectations, yet all groups had robust privacy expectations across contexts. Second, outsiders have difficulty in understanding the privacy norms of a particular community. For managers and scholars, this renders privacy expectations more difficult to identify at a distance or in deductive research.

We tested hypotheses using a sales contest scenario and six USBs, examining survey responses from 948 business-to-business salespeople of a multinational company's sales force in Canada, Mexico, and the USA. The results reveal that several psychographic variables (such as commitment, relationship to sales manager, and achievement need) affect salespeople's tendency to engage in USBs differently in each country. In addition, business ethics, individualism, and customer orientation advocacy associated with each country can be used to anticipate similarities and differences in USBs between countries.

This empirical study aims to understand what individual and organizational factors may affect aggressiveness when making accounting judgments. In particular, we examine the influence that prior ethics training, codes of ethics and an individual's predominant moral reasoning schema have on adherence to company policy in an accounting-related (depreciation) judgment. Results of the study show that respondents with prior ethics training are more likely to adhere to company accounting policy than those who have not had formal ethics education.

Of specific interest, the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), reports on a specific subset of the U.S. unemployed: the long-term unemployed, defined as those who are unemployed for 27 weeks and over. Since December 2009, the share of the long-term unemployed of the total U.S. unemployed has exceeded 40 percent (through April 2012), the highest level since 1948 when data was first collected. A phenomenon of this recession is an alleged public bias by American private sector employers against hiring the long-term unemployed, or even simply those unemployed.

In this paper the role of research ethics is analysed in as far as it contributes to or militates against future decision-outcomes that compromise the development of sustainable societies. The concept of sustainable development (Brundtland, 1987) came into being because of the enormous environmental, social and economic challenges manifesting in contemporary life. Many of these challenges are unintended consequences of historical decisions which were not necessarily considered unethical at the time. However, ethical standards are aligned with the norms and values upheld by societies and therefore change over time. There are various historical examples of research that would not be contemplated or permitted today due to contemporary ethical standards. This raises a question as to the frontier ethical standards against which contemporary research will be judged in the future. Research and innovation frequently have unintended or unanticipated consequences, which may be either favourable or detrimental, and outside the scope of the research. Various recent examples of negative unintended consequences of research are cited. It is shown that contemporary research ethics protocols do not typically draw attention to the possibilities of negative consequences due to their almost exclusive focus on the human participants and the research process itself. Using the five capitals model of sustainable development (natural, human, social, manufactured, and financial) it is demonstrated that typically the unanticipated consequences of research occur in one or more of the capitals other than the capital in which the research is being carried out. The central tenet of the paper is that researchers ought to consider and be accountable for favourable and detrimental consequences of their research. To this end, a taxonomy of negative consequences is developed with recommendations as to the researchers' obligations in respect of the unanticipated consequences of their research, classified as unaddressed, unintended, unexpected, unforeseen and unforeseeable. A more comprehensive view needs to be taken of the ethics of business and management research to include procedural ethics, intrinsic ethics, and extrinsic ethics. Sustainable development is integrated into research ethics by considering the interdependencies of the five capitals of sustainable development and proposing a protocol based on the twelve features of sustainable societies. It is argued that evaluation of research using the proposed ethics protocol would militate against or mitigate the negative unanticipated consequences of research, thereby contributing to more sustainable societies. It may be argued that individuals cannot be held responsible or accountable for that which is unintended. However, by applying their minds using a more powerful ethical framework, researchers are more likely to anticipate and militate against these potentially latent and often long term impacts of their research. The approach in this paper is practical and applied rather than theoretical, philosophical or moral; business ethics and the ethics of medical research involving human or animals are excluded. © Academic Publishing International Ltd.","Business decisions; Extrinsic research ethics; Five capitals; Sustainable society",

Advancement in IT and telecommunication has significant impacts on the development of these platforms and student learning behaviour. Especially, the emergence of online social network sites, for example Facebook, keeps changing the communication, interaction and interrelation of students and their daily life. The trend relating to the usage of Facebook shows that more and more people participate in and rely on Facebook. Even though online learning platforms provide the discussion forum feature, students prefer communicating on Facebook. In order to motivate student learning, teachers are trying to make use of Facebook as part of the online learning platform in addition to existing online learning platforms. Past research on online social network sites has suggested that factors influencing includes student learning attitude, social relationship and learning environments. However, seldom studies try to consolidate these factors and examine simultaneously. Besides, seldom studies take into accounts how these factors influence student engagement in learning through using Facebook as part of online learning platform. This study attempts to develop a model of student engagement in learning with four areas: (1) Teacherstudent interaction, (2) Convenience of technology, (3) Teacher-student relationship, (4) Student attitude toward Facebook. The students of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCS), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), studying Hi-Diploma Programme, are invited to participate in this study. A survey was conducted to examine how these factors affect students' engagement in learning. The results revealed that Convenience of technology, Teacher-student relationship and Student attitude toward Facebook influence significantly on student engagement in learning. The results show teachers how Facebook improves student engagement in learning.

When trying to understand the factors behind successful examples of eGovernment in the context of change management, most research so far focuses on the implementation phase in a literal sense and not on the planning phase, that precedes the implementation phase, or theevaluation phase that follows. This paper aims at remedying this by focusing on the planning phase; the development of an eGovernment strategy and vision, which is the departing point for a future implementation process. Through an in-depthcase study of the work done at a Swedish municipality, the city of Vasteras, this paper aims at answering the question: ""Which are the key change management aspects of an eGovernment planning process?"" By focusing on the planning phase of eGovernment in a Swedish municipality, this paper develops the knowledge and understanding of this kind of endeavour. Even if ICTs can be seen as a means to modernize government, technology alone cannot break down organizational and culturalbarriers - something that is necessary in order for the full benefits of eGovernment to be realized.

The willingness-to-pay for social features leads to ethical consumerism, which positively reinforces the continued focus on corporate responsibility among businesses.

Preston (1999) traces the notion of stakeholders back to the great depression in the United States (1929-1941), when the General Electric company defined four major stakeholder groups -shareholders, employees, customers, and the general public. Stakeholder management has become an important tool to transfer ethics to management practice and strategy. Few management topics have generated more debate in recent decades than the underlying notion, the model and the theories surrounding stakeholders (Donaldson and Preston, 1995; Gibson, 2000; Wolfe and Putler, 2002; Friedman and Miles, 2006). The visual power of the stakeholder model and its high simplicity are seen as contributors to the success of the stakeholder concept (Fassin, 2008). An increasing interrelation is observed between the concepts of stakeholder theory, corporate responsibility, and business ethics (Valor, 2005; Garriga et al., 2004). The stakeholder approach in the organization integrates stakeholder relationships within a company’s resource base, industry setting, and socio-political arena into a single analytical framework (Susniene & Sargunas, 2009).Mumford (1979) is one of the early researchers in supporting the involvement of end-users as a component of effective in-formation systems development and implementation, using essentially the stakeholder concept in this domain. It has been proved that end-users and managers are very important towards successful system implementation. As more interorganizational information systems are developed which usually involve strategic decisions, a yet wider range of stakeholders needs to be involved (Pouloudi, 1999). In these systems the attention may switch from end-users and focus on those parties that are external to the organization, but who can also be associated in decision making at a managerial or strategic level (Pouloudi & Whitely, 1997). One of the most thorough investigations of the stakeholder concept in information systems research that relates information systems stakeholders with implementation failure was made as an early work by Lyytinen and Hirschheim (1987, 1988). They argue that failure is conditional on the capability of information system to meet the expectations of different stakeholders -i.e. to say an information system may be considered successful by some stakeholder but a failure by others. The concept of stakeholder represents a progression from developer – and user – centered problems to organization-wide and inter organizational information system problems. This is a sign of maturity of information systems research to show how holistic representation of the parties involved in the more complex systems currently developed (Pouloudi, 1999). Stakeholder theory proposes an ethical use of stakeholder concept in Information systems as ethical considerations and professional conduct is a significant issue in information system.The stakeholder theory is extensively used in management in investigating organizational ambiance, strategic management, ethical concerns, business planning process, e-government, project management, environment management, etc. Recently stakeholders are also seen as means to more successful information and communication technologies and information system development and implementation issues. The paper presents stakeholder theory, its origin and applications in Information Systems (IS) field in the literature. The main objective of this research is to build up the knowledge body of stakeholder applications in information systems and technology areas. © 2013, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The empirical analysis, based on a sample of 126 firms drawn from the S&P500 group of companies over a 5-year period, suggests that board gender diversity (BGD) significantly affects CSP. However, this impact depends on the social performance metric under investigation. In particular, more gender diverse boards exert stronger influence on CSP metrics focusing on 'negative' business practices, such as the 'concerns' dimension of the Kinder Lydenberg Domini, Inc. (KLD) ratings. This is because such CSP ratings have the potential to induce higher levels of 'empathic caring', which strongly appeals to female directors. Hence, this study reveals further hidden connections in the BGD-CSP link which have important implications for managers, nongovernmental organisations and socially responsible investors. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Board gender diversity; Corporate social performance; Empathy; Ethics of care; Feminist ethics; Gender stereotypes; Social role theory",

Results show that more US than German companies undertake corporate citizenship activities and apply a wider variety of different forms.

And, (2) is there a significant relationship between boardroom diversity and corporate social performance. We first clarify the boardroom diversity concept, distinguishing between a structural diversity of boards and a demographic diversity in boards, and then we investigate its possible linkage to social performance in a sample of S&P500 firms. We find a significant relationship between diversity in boards and social performance. This relationship is moderated by diversity of boards. Our results also reveal the effects of the specific variables that make up the diversity of boards and diversity in boards constructs. In particular, gender, and age have a significant effect on corporate social performance. Some important measurement issues are raised and discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Board of directors; Boardroom diversity; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Gender diversity; KLD; Racial diversity",

The authors employed a US sample covering the period 1998-2007. Design/methodology/approach - In the context of the Fama and French model augmented by momentum and industry factors, the authors test the significance of the alpha for a CSP difference portfolio, defined as high-ranked minus low-ranked CSP stocks. Findings - The results are consistent with the ""no-linkage"" hypothesis, which argues that no significant difference in the risk-adjusted performance is expected between high- and low-ranked CSP-formed portfolios. Furthermore, little evidence was found that high- or low-ranked CSP-formed portfolios, irrespective of the portfolio formation type, systematically differ with regard to performance, size, book-to-market or momentum factors. Originality/value - The authors employ sustainability CSP rankings that focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) materiality factors, in contrast to many prior studies that solely use KLD ratings or just focus on a subarea of CSP. Moreover, the authors' dataset considerably improves upon previous studies employing similar data in which individual company rankings are not available.

The increasing pressures on corporations to produce and communicate CSP information will be described, as well as how the timely and meaningful communication of CSP can improve CFP. Methodology/approach -Subsequent to a review of relevant literature, three case examples from McDonald's, Nestle, and Stora Enso illustrate Hockerts and Moir's grounded theory framework that suggest how IROs can improve communication of CSP. Findings -This chapter illustrates three levels of communicating CSP information. First, IROs target SRI investors and respond to ESG inquiries and surveys. At the second level, IROs integrate ESG information into business strategy and finacial results. At the third level, IROs actively market CSP and create a two-way proactive dialogue between SRI investors and senior management and the board. Practical implications -This chapter provides practical examples to improve ESG activities and their communication via the IRO to SRI analysts and investors. Originality/value of chapter -This chapter contributes to the literature on the CSP-CFP link by illustrating how proactive IROs are improving the CSP information channel to SRI securities analysts and investors. Furthermore, it advances the theory and research concerning the impact of the information channel between IROs and securities analysts behind the CSP-CFP link.

Design/methodology/ approach-The study adopts a multi-perspective approach, referring to different theoretical frameworks on CSD, such as the legitimacy theory, the stakeholder theory, the agency model, the asymmetric information theory, and the institutional perspective. The empirical research is based on the sustainability reports of 80 companies in which investments were made by European socially responsible funds (SRFs) listed on the Morningstar platform during the years 2009-2008. The theoretical hypotheses are tested by a univariate and multivariate analysis. Findings-The breadth of the CSD depends on multiple factors, both external and internal, such as the country of origin, the industry reputation, the firm size, the frequency of the SRFs participation, the corporate social performance. Research limitations/implications-Limits inherent in this type of research are the comparability of the CSR reports and the systematization of the categories of content to be analyzed. Practical implications-The chapter identifies several factors that lead to a greater completeness of the CSD, exploiting the capacity of the social reporting to trigger benefits for the firms such as a stronger social legitimacy and the reduction of asymmetric information. Social implications-The research supports the investigation of the levers of CSD to meet the demand for a broader accountability. Originality/value-The reference to firms in which SRFs participated allows to focus on companies ascertained as socially responsible in accordance with a ""certification function"" of these funds. Findings support an approach which is not one-sided, thus enabling to look at the determinants of the CSD through different theoretical perspectives.

Design/methodology/approach: The history-of-management-thought approach to social responsibility (SR) is grounded in the paradigm of continuing progress exemplified by the contributions of great management thinkers (e.g. Fayol, Taylor, Follett, Barnard). A historical evolution of the SR concept is provided, together with tracing the development of stakeholder theory in its attempt to depict the relationship between stakeholder management and SR. Findings: Three management philosophies (recognition of the external environment, a need for collaboration, and a need for a shared understanding) emerge from both classical and modern management thinkers. Recent conceptualizations have added depth by clarifying the meaning of social responsibility and in addition, detailing the nature of firm-stakeholder relationships. Despite voluminous literature, achieving collaborative integration between firms and stakeholders in practice appears elusive. Practical implications: These management philosophies can help organizations navigate the intertwined relationship between business and society. Business leaders need to consider the vital role of trust in building more collaborative relationships.

The instrumental dominant logic of cause-related marketing focuses on attracting customers' attention in order to generate sales. The relational dominant logic of cause-related marketing focuses on building relationships with the target stakeholders through the enhancement of a firm's legitimacy. The combination of these two types of logic gives rise to four types of cause-related marketing: altruistic, commercial, social and integrative.

In this paper, we focus on the question: What strategies can help decision-makers to better connect with stakeholders and overcome the challenges of conflicting interests when considering sustainability in their business models? Our research draws on two case studies in the Brazilian energy sector: the national oil company Petrobras and its attempts to develop biodiesel, and the national electrical utility Eletrobras and its attempts to provide electricity to impoverished communities. This paper is based on original qualitative data derived frominterviews with 138 key informants conducted between 2003 and 2010 with supply chain members and other stakeholders, as well as secondary sources. We draw from a number of literature streams to develop our paper. One stream relates to sustainable supply chain and the recognition of the relationship among economic, environmental and social values rather than only focusing on economic and/or environmental aspects. Another stream suggests that BOP (Bottom of the Pyramid) settings present potential ideal opportunities to connect business with sustainability. Finally, we use stakeholder theory to analyze how sustainable values can drive the operationalization of sustainable business models. We suggest that a combination of approaches promoting the participation of a diverse number of local stakeholders, encouraging both learning and capability building and shifting stakeholder values from single to multiple objectives are critical to overcome the challenges of stakeholders conflicting interests. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Corporate governance as well as the way national and local governments practise governance can have direct impact on communities located in areas near to extractive industries and even further afield. However, although risk analyses are considered in feasibility studies, including the conduct of environmental impact assessments of mining investments, what has attracted less attention are the consequences of poor governance in managing/mitigating risks when communities which traditionally are 'resource guardians' are not consulted during stakeholder discussions as part of investment negotiations. Academic literature and popular media are replete with examples of the high price paid by some communities, including loss of lives and livelihoods, when investors and governments ignore opportunities for meaningful engagement with stakeholders. And, although recommendations have been made on how to improve meaningful stakeholder engagement, the various discussions/articles have not revealed consensus on how best to create meaningful stakeholder engagement in regions rich in natural resources sometimes described as suffering from 'resource curse'. In considering ways in which meaningful stakeholder engagement could convert the resource curse into 'resource blessings', the question may well be asked, what are the indicators of meaningful stakeholder engagement and how can this be strengthened through greater transparency in governance? Drawing on a case study of diamond mining in Botswana and the mining of platinum in South Africa, this chapter provides an overview of approaches to risk assessment by companies and governments and examines key indicators of governance which impact on the lives and livelihoods of communities directly affecting by mining operations. In addition, the author highlights how risks associated with poor governance can derail attainment of development objectives as well as opportunities that act as catalysts in transforming communities and meeting national development objectives.

Semi-structured interviews and a scenario workshop were employed, creating individual space for expression of ideas, then a collaborative space for sharing these, exploring differences of perception and meaning, and developing a set of possible and plausible scenarios. Whilst the workshop resulted in consensus on key issues and proposed actions, intended to inform policy formation and planning, there was an unforeseen lack of short term follow up and of the groups working more closely together. We discuss the reasons for this through reflective critical analysis of both our own process and of contingent factors in the wider contextual environment.

Many more companies have come under the spotlight of activist attention as the agenda social activists address has expanded, provoked in part by the internationalization of business. During the past fifteen years, companies have begun to formulate corporate responsibility (CR) policies and appointed management teams dedicated to CR, resulting in a change in the way companies interact with social activists. This paper presents findings from a longitudinal case study of managerial responses to social activism targeted at a company with relatively well-advanced CR practices and reputation. The case describes the unfolding of the internal processes over an 8-year period, including the role played by different managers and the tensions in the decision-making processes. The findings emphasize how values and beliefs in the company interact with economic arguments and how those are mediated through functions and relationships in the company and beyond. The paper shows how critical managers' understanding of the motivations of activists behind the campaign is in shaping their actions. It reveals the paradoxical outcomes that can result from social activism at the level of the firm, the industry, and the field. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate responsibility; Cybernetic model; Dynamic interactions and responses; Outcomes; Social activism",

In the 1970s and 1980s, studies mostly originated from Anglo-Saxon and Western European countries. During the last two decades research on responsibility reporting was increasingly undertaken in emerging and developing countries as well - always following the reporting practices of the respective businesses. Consequentially, a very large number of studies exist today. Many of these have empirically investigated the determinants of responsibility reporting and examined whether internal factors like size and industry or external factors like stakeholder pressures have an impact on disclosure. Thus, the purpose of the following paper is twofold. First, it seeks to provide an overview of the existing literature in order to facilitate further research. Overall, 186 studies have been examined for the determinants which they considered and have been grouped according to their geographical origin. This provides for an analysis of whether academics from different regions have taken different approaches to the empirical examination of responsibility reporting and if their results differed. The findings show that scholars across regions have taken different paths in empirical research, but indications for a variation in the impact of specific determinants on reporting are weak. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Accountability; Corporate responsibility; Disclosure; Environmental policy; Literature review; Meta-analysis; Social and environmental reporting; Sustainability; Sustainable development","accountability; comparative study; corporate strategy; empirical analysis; environmental policy; firm size; literature review; meta-analysis; stakeholder; sustainability; Western Europe"

We argue that a firm's competitive advantage fundamentally depends on its capacity for stakeholder management related, transformational adaptation over time. Our new temporal stakeholder management approach builds upon insights from both the resource-based view (RBV) in strategic management and institutional theory. Stakeholder agendas and their relative salience to the firm evolve over time, a phenomenon well understood in the literature, and requiring what we call level 1 adaptation. However, the dominant direction of stakeholder pressures can also change, namely, from supporting resource heterogeneity at the firm level to fostering industry homogeneity, and vice versa. When dominant stakeholder pressures shift from supporting heterogeneity towards stimulating homogeneity in industry, the firm must engage in level 2 or transformational adaptation. Stakeholders typically provide valuable resources to the firm in an early stage. Without these resources, which foster heterogeneity (in line with RBV thinking), the firm would not exist. At a later stage, stakeholders also contribute to inter-firm homogeneity via isomorphism pressures (in line with institutional theory thinking). Adding a temporal dimension to stakeholder management theory has far reaching implications for this theory's practical relevance to senior level management in business. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Competitive advantage; Institutional theory; Resource-based view; Stakeholder management theory; Temporal perspective",

By examining citations from articles published in three top business ethics journals (Journal of Business Ethics, Business Ethics Quarterly and Business Ethics: A European Review) over the period 2004-2008, we document that the preponderance of influential business ethics research comes primarily from the management faculty. In addition, management journals and management books are the predominant sources for influential business ethics research. Further, among the management fields, organizational behavior and organizational structure predominate leadership and strategy as the major subject areas for influential business ethics research, suggesting that this influential body of research is focused on a micro rather than on a macro context. These empirical results lend credence to the perception that there is a silo effect in influential business ethics research and suggest that business ethics research in a micro context might have permeated to the teaching of business ethics. © 2013 The Authors.",,

In particular, little is known about how corporate decision-makers privately reconcile the conflicts between public and private interests, even though this is likely to be relevant to understanding the limitations of CSR as a means of aligning business activity with the broader public interest. This study addresses this issue using internal tobacco industry documents to explore British-American Tobacco's (BAT) thinking on CSR and its effects on the company's CSR Programme. The article presents a three-stage model of CSR development, based on Sykes and Matza's theory of techniques of neutralization, which links together: how BAT managers made sense of the company's declining political authority in the mid-1990s; how they subsequently justified the use of CSR as a tool of stakeholder management aimed at diffusing the political impact of public health advocates by breaking up political constituencies working towards evidence-based tobacco regulation; and how CSR works ideologically to shape stakeholders' perceptions of the relative merits of competing approaches to tobacco control. Our analysis has three implications for research and practice. First, it underlines the importance of approaching corporate managers' public comments on CSR critically and situating them in their economic, political and historical contexts. Second, it illustrates the importance of focusing on the political aims and effects of CSR. Third, by showing how CSR practices are used to stymie evidence-based government regulation, the article underlines the importance of highlighting and developing matrices to assess the negative social impacts of CSR. © 2012 The Author(s).","Corporate political activity; Corporate social responsibility; Political CSR; Stakeholder management; Techniques of neutralization",

I suggest that legal and psychological research streams can be drawn upon to create a new genre of critical business ethics that differs from normative and empirical business ethics. In psychology, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) suggests how the mainstream ideology within an academic field can be criticized as a reflection of a self-righteous, us-them mind-set. In law, Critical Legal Studies (CLS) suggests how a field's mainstream ideology can be criticized as a rationalization of the status quo. I suggest that the MFT and CLS criticisms of ideology can be joined to develop a critical approach to business ethics that seriously examines science on normatively charged topics, such as liberal-conservative differences and implicit attitudes, and that frames it in terms of alternative narratives.","Critical business ethics; Critical legal studies; Ideology; Moral foundations theory",

By educating those held most responsible for the crisis - financial traders and speculators - they are said to have produced ruthlessly talented graduates who have ambition in abundance but little sense for social responsibility or ethics. This ethical lack thrives upon the trading floor within a compelling critique of the complicity of the pedagogy of the business school with the financial crisis of the global economy. An ethical turn within the curriculum is now widely encouraged as a counteractive force. Within this paper, however, we argue that taking this ethical turn is not enough. For business ethicists to learn from the financial crisis, the crisis' legacy needs to be taken account of, and financialisation needs to be taken seriously. Pedagogical reform cannot bracket itself off from the crisis as if it were coincidental with or separate from it. Post-crisis pedagogy must rather take the fact that it is requested now, in light of the crisis, as its very point of departure. The financial crisis must not be understood as something to be resisted in the name of Business Ethics. Instead, the financial crisis must be understood as the very foundation for contemporary Business Ethics in particular and for contemporary business and management education more generally. © 2012 The Authors.",,

Further, because for Badiou there cannot be economic truths per se - rather, economic matters must be understood in their relation to one or more truths in the domain of love, art, science or politics - a Badiouian business ethics would look entirely distinct from any ethics that simply places limits on certain kinds of economic activity. Although Slavoj Žižek, among others, has suggested that this marks an essential weakness in Badiou's economic/political theory, it may actually be the greatest strength of his position. Within a capitalist system, a Badiouian business ethics would then be a question of mobilizing economic resources in order to serve the ongoing construction of a truth procedure. For a business to be considered ethical on Badiou's terms, it must break - and continue to break - from the dominant logic of capitalism and its merely economic pursuit of profit maximization. © 2013 The Author.",,

While business ethics has as its locus of interest the ethicality of organizations themselves, central issues that have emerged in Organization concern how individuals might (or might not) maintain a valued experience of themselves as ethical subjects despite the behaviour of organizations, and how organizational arrangements might be politically contested in the name of ethics. We explore this in relation to a question that unites much of the study of ethics in Organization: how do we live (and work) together in a world beset by difference? We consider this question in terms of the issue of ethical subjectivity and the relation between an ethics of consensus and an ethics of difference.

Chemical companies have assumed that reducing costs, increasing yields, and developing better feedstock supplies will guarantee the success of bioplastics in the market, yet a number of unconventional hurdles exist. Companies need to build markets for bioplastics and to assure customers that bioplastics are indeed sustainably made. We contend that companies are most able to develop business models that bring bioplastics to market effectively when they develop and mobilize their ""dynamic capabilities"" around sustainability. DuPont, BASF, and Braskem have identified new market opportunities for bioplastics, designed distinctive types of business models to seize these opportunities, and devised ways to create increased value by communicating performance advantages and environmental impact reduction to downstream entities. Because they have not included societal actors in their efforts to define sustainability, the firms face significant risk that their sustainable value propositions may not endure without further innovations in creating accountability systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It will show that a threefold division should be adopted to distinguish moral obligations applying to their interactions in the market, obligations applying to their interactions inside business firms and obligations applying to their interactions with agents outside the market. Competition might be permissible in the first case since markets are special patterns of social interactions (called adversarial schemes). They produce their benefits when agents try to satisfy exclusive preferences at the expense of others. However, moral obligations inside the firm and moral obligations outside the market are of a different nature. This argument will be developed in the two first parts of this paper. In the third part, it will outline the relevant strengths of that account in relation with two popular views of economic agents' moral obligations: the shareholder primacy view and the stakeholder theory. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adversarial ethics; Competition; Cooperation; Market; Rivalry; Shareholder primacy; Stakeholder theory",

However, while existing literature emphasises the importance for MNEs to collaborate with various stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research on the scope, peculiarities, and impact of such cooperation has been limited, particularly in those countries in Central Africa with a fragile state and weak governance structure. Furthermore, until recently, MNEs and NGOs in conflict countries had antagonistic relationships, which have created impediments for positive engagement. This paper examines MNEs and conflict issues, including interactions with NGOs, and sheds light on possible MNE contributions to peaceful societies by highlighting a few innovative partnerships of MNEs and non-business partners in Central Africa. Innovative partnerships take the conflict context into account, have a learning or capacity-building component, are part of a more comprehensive development plan yet are embedded at the community level, and tackle issues directly related to the conflict, such as governance, human rights, artisanal mining, and transparency.

This article investigates the differences in the business models of SFSCs that may be attributed to the initiator-stakeholder, interacting with other stakeholders. Essential to business models are the value proposition, value creation and value capture, but it is the ambition of the initiator-stakeholder that starts a SFSC. Initiator-stakeholders of 57 SFSCs were interviewed on a combination of both multiple choice and open questions. The data converges on three categories of business models. First and foremost, a large majority of SFSCs is driven by the aim of the initiator-stakeholder to increase economic viability, uses the market as governance structure, resulting in profit margins likely to be above margins in conventional business. Two other categories of business models of SFSCs group around the theme of producer-support, and, producer-consumer interaction, respectively.","business models; food supply chain; stakeholder engagement",

Arguably, the frontrunner businesses that orient themselves towards sustainable market transitions develop a competitive advantage by co-creating these sustainable markets and on the short term develop renewed ambition and enthusiasm. By means of the transition framework, we argue that the fundamental societal changes emerging lead to a new phase in corporate responsibility, implying fundamental transitions within businesses. Based on this perspective and the transition management approach we explore how businesses might proactively engage with sustainability transitions in their direct context and link these to internal business transitions.

This work reviews a range of mathematical models, computing tools and, particularly, multi-criteria decision-making techniques that have been applied in the last 25 years to help politicians, health officials, local authority representatives and emergency planning officers devise better countermeasure strategies in the event of a radiation accident. The paper discusses all phases of a nuclear emergency as well as emergency training and planning. It highlights what has been achieved in the application of multi-criteria decision analysis, mainly through initiatives such as the EU-funded real-time online decision support projects. It examines how such tools that have been developed fit into the formulation, evaluation and appraisal stages of the emergency management process and discusses the complex socio-technical issues that arise from radiation accidents. © The authors 2012.

This study focused on the corporate social responsibility activities of these companies with respect to the governance structure put in place and the funds allocated for such activities. The study found that the Ghana Chamber of Mines in reporting the expenditure its members made on corporate social responsibility activities added cost elements which do not qualify to be referred to as corporate social responsibility. The funds set aside for social corporate responsibility were very small and could not bring about a meaningful change in the communities. Also, the companies operated various governance modules with different levels of community participation.

We begin by delving into the relationship between individual values and organizational values. This analysis reveals that the ""value fit"" approach to creating authenticity is limited, and also indicates that a deeper exploration of the nature of values and the role of leadership is necessary. More specifically, we propose that organizational values should be viewed as an opportunity for ongoing conversations about who we are and how we connect. Through this type of dialogue which we define as ""value through conversation"", we can create what we call poetic organizations.

The study confirmed that high levels of perceived corporate unethicality decrease consumer trust. This in turn reduces consumer satisfaction, which ultimately has negative effects on customer loyalty. It was also revealed that, although both consumer gender and urbanity have a moderating effect on the link between perceived unethicality and trust, the age group and level of education of the consumer did not exhibit such an effect. With regard to consumer cultural characteristics, both high uncertainty avoidance and low individualism were found to increase the negative impact of business unethicality on trust, as opposed to power distance and masculinity that did not have any moderating effect on this relationship.

This characterization of trust is best thought of as epistemological because epistemic states distinguish trust from other dispositions. The epistemological characterization of trust is the amoral one referred to in the title of this paper, and we argue that this characterization is conceptually inadequate. We outline and defend an alternative conception of trust as a moral phenomenon: when A trusts B to do something, A invites B to acknowledge and accept an obligation; when B accepts the invitation, B takes on an obligation; in that way trust creates an obligation. We conclude with an application, drawing out the difference between the epistemological conception of trust and our own in the context of Ghoshal et al.'s (Sloan Management Review 40:9-20, 1995, Academy of Management Learning & Education 4:75-91, 2005) critique of transaction cost theories of the firm. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Moral relationships; Organizational ethics; Transaction cost theory of the firm; Trust",

This study examines an ethic of care approach to crisis management analysing the case of Northern Rock bank which was at the centre of the recent financial crisis in the UK. The development and maintenance of relationships is fundamental to an ethic of care approach and the research recognises this by examining the bank-stakeholder relationship both before and after the crisis. Considerable anger was directed at the bank post-crisis and, subsequently, the management team resigned. An important contention is that because an ethic of care approach had not been followed external parties judged that management should have foreseen the crisis and the harm caused was deemed intentional, even though predicting the crisis would have been difficult and it is improbable any harm was intended. Additionally, this negative reaction was heightened due to three facets of Northern Rock's history: (i) its previous existence as a building society, (ii) the 'local' nature of the bank and (iii) the creation of The Northern Rock Foundation. These historical factors caused local stakeholders to presume a 'caring' relationship between themselves, and the bank had continued to exist post-demutualisation. The events of the crisis compelled stakeholders to re-appraise this presumption, amplifying the post-crisis anger. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bank; Crisis; Crisis management; Ethic of care; Foresight; Intention",

This study adopted a case study method to identify and communicate practical challenges and solutions of Eileen Fisher, a women's apparel manufacturer. Data were collected from thirteen in-depth interviews conducted with members of the case company and its suppliers, with secondary data analysis from the case company's website and archival records. The study identified five challenges the case company encountered with respect to maintaining product value, quality, and aesthetics, meeting needs of suppliers, and coping with higher material and labor costs. Five solutions were put into place supporting sustainability objectives, and which highlight the practice of innovation in design, optimizing timing and resources, gathering and diffusing information, relationship management, and making trade-offs for cost and value. Five principles, which guided the design team and its interaction with upstream suppliers, were identified and modeled. The implication for other apparel companies in overcoming challenges of sustainable product development is that it begins with a clear mission, strong company mandate, and like-minded supply partners.

No research, however, has examined the possible positive benefits of integrating faith and work.

To make our case, we employ a utilitarian moral standard and examine the apparent logical sequence behind the link between shareholder wealth maximization and social welfare. Upon close empirical and conceptual scrutiny, we find that utilitarian criteria do not support the shareholder model; that is, shareholder wealth maximization is only weakly linked to social welfare maximization.

It aims at analyzing the relationship between the reasons why firms adopt CSR and the importance given to voluntary CSR disclosure. Methodology-Two main categories of CSR determinants have been identified: the external ones, coming from the environment outside the firm, and the internal determinants, which are linked to some specific characteristics of the enterprise and to the objectives it pursues. The analyzed sample consists of 120 large Italian manufacturing and non manufacturing enterprises. The research hypotheses concerning the relationship between external and internal determinants of CSR and CSR disclosure were verified using an independent sample t-test, evaluating the equal variances of clusters using the Levene's test. Findings-Main results point out that in companies giving importance to CSR disclosure, the internal drivers are more relevant than the external ones in determining the attitude toward CSR. Among the internal determinants, drivers related to company and management values and ethics are quite relevant. Research limitations-This study is subject to the limitations that generally apply to cross-sectional survey-based research. Originality/Value of chapter-Our research findings show that legitimacy theory represents the most relevant theory in explaining CSR disclosure practices of Italian large firms, as well as the operational implementation of stakeholder theory, such as stakeholder management.

These organizations seek to achieve social missions through business ventures. Yet social missions and business ventures are associated with divergent goals, values, norms, and identities. Attending to them simultaneously creates tensions, competing demands, and ethical dilemmas. Effectively understanding social enterprises therefore depends on insight into the nature and management of these tensions. While existing research recognizes tensions between social missions and business ventures, we lack any systematic analysis. Our paper addresses this issue. We first categorize the types of tensions that arise between social missions and business ventures, emphasizing their prevalence and variety. We then explore how four different organizational theories offer insight into these tensions, and we develop an agenda for future research. We end by arguing that a focus on social-business tensions not only expands insight into social enterprises, but also provides an opportunity for research on social enterprises to inform traditional organizational theories. Taken together, our analysis of tensions in social enterprises integrates and seeks to energize research on this expanding phenomenon. ©2013 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Hybrid organizations; Institutional theory; Organizational identity; Paradox theory; Social enterprise; Social entrepreneur; Stakeholder theory",

Academic efforts primarily focus on prevention while practitioners are often left to hold firms and executives (including directors) accountable through a variety of sanctions. Even so, executive malfeasance still occurs even in the face of the vast resources used to monitor, control, and penalize firms and executives. In this paper, we posit equity markets do not adequately penalize firms for inaccurate earnings reports. Using a sample of 129 firms identified by the U.S. General Accounting Office for reporting fraudulent earnings in 10K filings, we found support for our assertion. Consequently, the one party who may benefit but escape accountability is firm shareholders. Moreover, we find little empirical evidence that the subset of firms sanctioned by the SEC is penalized more heavily than the full sample by markets at the time they report and correct their 10K filings. Our results raise serious questions whether such managerial opportunism can be eradicated given the apparent lack of consequences in equity markets for investors. We also question whether the SEC is able to discern between fraud and error in financial reporting and its implications. ©2013 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Corporate governance; Earnings management; Earnings misstatements; Executive crime; Fraud; Shareholder responsibility",

With the help of a framework developed from Badiou's work on ethics, I conduct a metacritique of business ethics as being intolerant (exclusion of voices), nihilist (concerned with necessity and economics), reactive (to social movements in the 1960s, arguing that there has always been an ethics of business) and obscure (building upon the atemporal body of knowledge in ethics). Opposed to these tendencies, with the help of the constructive Badiou, I argue that business ethics should move towards the creation of faithful subjects possibly formed by 'inexistent' research in the field, as well as concerning itself with closely studying and identifying empirical cases of faithful subject formations and their deviations. © 2013 The Author.",,

Revealing the long-term orientation as the variable which permits us to link the principal goal of organization, being ""survival,"" with innovation and ethic, the article devises a framework for incorporating ethics into a company's processes and strategies for innovation. With the principal goal of organizations being ""survival"" in the long-term, it is assumed that innovation is necessary in order to realize a going concern. Firms that do not innovate and adapt to rapidly changing business environments are less likely to be sustainable. Thus, it is in a business' best interests to adopt an innovation process for long-term success. We posit that there are two simultaneous sources of innovation and change that are unavoidable and embedded in the corporate landscape. First, we argue for genetically embedded, Darwinian explanations for adaptations that enable an entity's survival. This view is combined with more conventional, social science explanations for change. Our new, comprehensive model of the governance of innovation processes hinges on the one hand on an organization's long-term orientation, which we argue, is not possible without a consideration of an ethical dimension. On the other hand, the model employs, for the first time, the concept of duality, in order to make the positive coexistence of innovation and ethic analytically visible. Guided by this concept the roots of the ethic within innovation are traced from both natural science forces for change, and cultural pressures operating on members of an organization. We present our Integrated Causal Model of Innovation and propose theoretical relationships that will generate numerous avenues for future research in the field, and help managers to reorient their governance strategies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Corporate governance; Culture; Evolutionary theory; Innovation; Natural science; Values",

Based on findings from within- and cross-case analysis, we propose that perceived unethical behavior among venture partners triggers conflicts between them through increased fault attribution or blaming. Further, we propose that perceived unethical behavior affects venture partners' choice of conflict management strategy and increases the likelihood of conflict escalation and of conflict having a negative partnership outcome such as failure or another form of involuntary exit.

However, whether these double standards are necessarily due to the fact that one party is a business company while the other is a consumer was not addressed. The results of our two experimental studies, conducted among 277 (Study 1) and 264 (Study 2) participants from a Western European country by means of an anonymous self-administered online survey, demonstrate that the respondents were not only harsher in their judgments of unethical business (vs. consumer) behavior, but also harsher in their judgments of unethical behavior by prosperous (vs. non-prosperous) consumers and prosperous (vs. non-prosperous) business companies (Study 1). Further, they were also less tolerant of unethical behavior by consumers (vs. one's best friend) and business companies with which they have a less than good (vs. a good) relationship (Study 2). These results indicate that double standards are due to differences in perceived wealth between subjects and in the individual's relationship with subjects. These two factors imply that double standards are not strictly reserved to consumer-business relations, but might also be used in business-business and consumer-consumer relations. Further, these results indicate that companies need to be aware of the fact that good financial figures may backfire as they might lead individuals to be more critical of a company's deceptive practices. Moreover, these findings point to the importance of businesses investing resources-and to keep investing resources-in developing a good relationship with stakeholders as these good relationships lead to stakeholders being less prone to make moral condemnations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; Consumer ethics; Double standards; Ethical beliefs; Marketing ethics; Moral hypocrisy; Relationship; Wealth",

Unfortunately, some accidents have been reported in Japan such as concealment of motor vehicle recalls, mass food poisoning caused by milk, train derailment accidents and architectural forgery. They arose from errors in decision-making made by engineers and/or other stakeholders as well as from imperfections in the organizational systems. In addition, a severe accident occurred at a nuclear power station in 2011. This accident was caused by a major earthquake and a huge tsunami. However, it should be discussed why this accident was not prevented from the viewpoints of technology and risk management. Public health and welfare has suffered due to such accidents. As most engineers are employees, these accidents are not only the responsibility of engineers but also of other stakeholders in business companies, such as managers and entire companies. Engineers did not accomplish the public mission in these cases. Business companies took inadequate actions in risk management and social responsibility. In addition, the government could not supervise the nuclear power station sufficiently before the severe accident occurred. The public determines whether it is willing to accept the risk or not. Therefore, risk communication is required for all of stakeholders, especially for a high-risk technology. Engineers, business companies and the government should disclose risk information and should communicate with the public. They should also discuss with the public how to use a technology for ethical decision-making.","Business ethics; Engineering ethics; Human error; Professional; Public mission","Accidents; Derailments; Economic and social effects; Engineers; Errors; Human resource management; Nuclear energy; Nuclear reactor accidents; Philosophical aspects; Professional aspects; Risk management; Social aspects; Business ethics; Engineering ethics; Human errors; Professional; Public mission; Decision making"

Evidence was found for compliance with 14 of Avery's 19 sustainable leadership elements, but to various degrees. The elements were categorised into six core groups of practices: adopting a long-term perspective, focusing on people priority, strong organisational culture, nurturing innovation, social and environmental responsibility, and ethical behaviour.

Specifically, I argue that the most ethically debilitating crisis is the fact that we look to leadership to solve organisational ethical ills. There is, I argue, a pressing need to conceptualise a business ethics that is not constrained by the straitjacket of official hierarchy - a need to denaturalise 'leadership' as the normal or rightful locus of ethical regulation and renewal in business organisation.

First, we outline the discursive topographies of strategy and ethics in respect to their abstract relations, and examine their integument in business ethics and strategy in context. Then, we show how there cannot be a simple coexistence of these two categories in organisational practice: one must in fact be subordinate to the other, although this subordination can produce the persistence of the other, even in its negation. Finally, we conclude that the asymmetrical nature of ethics and strategy entails that whereas ethics can immanently give rise to strategy, strategic questions on their own can only produce anti-systemic ethical responses. © 2012 The Authors.",,

Design/methodology/approach: This study surveyed 180 students enrolled in graduate and/or undergraduate level classes in three different universities in the Midwest and Southwest regions of the USA. The structural equation modelling (SEM) technique was employed to analyze data and examine the conceptual model proposed in the current study. Findings: The results suggest that the paradoxes of social networking sites (assimilation/isolation and competence/incompetence) are significant antecedents of online social networking pleasure and loyalty. Furthermore, the results suggest that pleasure mediates the relationships between paradoxes of social networking sites and loyalty toward social networking sites. Research limitations/implications: A sustainable business strategy for SNSs would be to maintain a safe environment that on one hand promotes continuous innovations and on the other hand facilitates desired feelings such as fun, pleasure, and adventure. Results based on student sample suggest more works are needed to generalize the findings. Practical implications: This study points out online communication technologies (e.g., SNSs) are a double-edged sword for consumers.

Findings: The finding offered in this paper is that in order to progress beyond the efficiency phase of CS, firms need to shift from justifying the business case for sustainability, to understanding how to mobilise their IC to progress towards a more ecological sustainable and socially equitable enterprise. Ongoing evolution, with regard to the approach adopted for the management of IC, is also helping to drive organisational change towards more sustainable business models. Each category of IC plays a role with regard to operationalising CS into practice and supporting organisational change. The identified roles include motivating, supporting, implementing and performance. Research limitations/implications: In relation to the interview data collected it is generally limited to the views of the senior management and as such may not reflect the views of the employees of the organisation. Originality/value: This paper adds to the conversation of the third stage of IC research, based on the proposition that the performative approach to IC can help move business beyond the eco-efficiency stage of corporate sustainability and in doing so improves the relevance and usefulness of the IC concept for business organisations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Corporate sustainability; Critical management studies; Intellectual capital; Ostensive; Performative; Property and construction sector; Sustainable development",

Methodology/approach - Within an action research approach consisting of the establishment of a pilot service provision, we conducted ethnographies including in-depth interviews and focus groups. Findings - The adoption of access-based provisions is constrained by low compatibility with consumer culture. Consumers are concerned with the provision's ability to satisfy their needs, what this mode of consumption says about them, and the extent to which it associates them with communities of practice. Research limitations - The limitations are the typical ones of action research, which is linked to a unique, researcher-generated context where the researcher is also a participant, and therefore are difficult to generalize. Research implications - The large-scale implementation of PSS underpinning ABC is problematic as it challenges consumers' needs for self-expression and affiliation; however, we found that consumers in this specific context are responsive to the environmental efficiency of PSS.

Then we use arguments to speculate how the appearance of institutional entrepreneurs who are advocates for a new hybrid form of nepotism might begin to colonize a social space created by larger political and economic changes that are sweeping the Arab World. Those entrepreneurs must persuade other members of an extended family that the current practice of nepotism is typically destructive of a firm's competitive performance. In addition, they will argue that nepotism as currently practiced violates teachings of Islam.

The article then seeks to ground ethically desirable elements of a corporate apology in the nature or essence of the corporate apology itself. It explores the largely ignored roles played by the speaker's ethos and audience pathos in genuine or ethical apologies and suggests that attention needs to be paid to the problems posed by ""role contamination,"" context, and other overlooked factors. The reception by the actual audience of a given apology is a highly contingent matter.

The process is irreversible and we have to live through it. It does have several advantages, but at the same time it impacts individual's personal life, social relationships and world's ecosystem adversely. These challenges can be met through adopting tenets of holistic life prescribed in traditional Indian culture. In contrast to Western linear world view, the relational worldview in Indian culture sees life through harmonious relationships where healthy living is achieved by maintaining balance between the many interrelating factors in one's circle of life. The relational worldview model for holistic living can best be represented through three major factors that together must come into balance. These factors represent mind-body-spirit and their positive relationship with society and nature. Besides internal harmony in mind-bodyspirit, ancient literature verbalizes of relational harmony with the ecology and society. It emphasizes on an understanding of the intrinsic interdependence of all beings. Social harmony in accordance with the percepts of dharma and karma are considered essential for a healthy and peaceful life journey towards self-realization. Every individual is considered as a biologically, psychologically and spiritually part of nature's nonpolluting, intelligent ways. The nature itself is a living system, and the psyche and body exists within this larger system. The paper presents Indian tradition of holistic living that has time tested concepts for the all round development of an individual with proper balance of the importance of self, the society and the nature. The concepts have survived since the vedic period because of their sheer practicality. They are still valid and in fact, more relevant in today's complexities of day-to-day life.",,

An important aspect of these behavioral drivers is that they may operate (at least in part) through emotions. Emotions influence behavior in ways that are relevant to performance in processes; for example, anger prompts employees to refuse cooperation, fear inhibits workers' willingness to take initiatives (for example, in continuous improvement), and shame motivates them to change behavior. This study provides experimental evidence that the social preferences systematically trigger emotions. This happens not ""linearly"" (more achievement of a social preference might be expected to cause more positive emotions), but rather in more complex patterns that regulate social relationships. Arbitrary (but earned) status signals trigger pride, while status achievement from being lucky does not. An externally (not by an own fault) caused status loss triggers anger and disgust. Not receiving cooperation by another person triggers anger, but more so if the cooperation failure violates a reciprocity expectation; the happiness form receiving cooperation by another person is attenuated by guilt and sadness is the subject itself has previously refused cooperation to the other person. Events happening to salient in-group members trigger emotions as if they happened to subjects directly, including if the in-group member behaves in an embarrassing way. These results are relevant for front-line managers because they help predicting and interpreting emotional reactions of employees: awarding or withholding status, offering or demanding reciprocity, and the creation of in-groups have emotional effects that depend on the context in predictable ways. Our results also contribute to theory by connecting literatures on emotions, decision making, and behavioral operations. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Behavior in processes; Emotions; Experiments; Group identity; Reciprocity; Social preferences; Status","Experiments; Industrial engineering; Operations research; Emotions; Group identities; In-process; Reciprocity; Social preference; Status; Human resource management"

In online social media-sharing communities, the success of social interactions for content sharing and dissemination among completely unknown users depends on 'trust'. Therefore, providing a satisfactory trust model to evaluate the quality of content and to recommend personalized trustworthy content providers is vital for a successful online social media-sharing community. Current research on trust prediction strongly relies on a web of trust, which is directly collected from users. However, the web of trust is not always available in online communities and, even when it is available, it is often too sparse to accurately predict the trust value between two unacquainted people. Moreover, most of the extant trust research studies have not paid attention to the importance of distrust, even though distrust is a distinct concept from trust with different impacts on behavior. In this paper, we adopt the concepts of 'trust', 'distrust', and 'lack of confidence' in social relationships and propose a novel unifying framework to predict trust and distrust as well as to distinguish the confidently-made decisions (trust or distrust) from lack of confidence without a web of trust. This approach uses interaction histories among users including rating data that is available and much denser than explicit trust/distrust statements (i.e. a web of trust). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this chapter we take the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and use it as a lens to explore and critique talent-management practices. We begin with a brief summary of the RBV and use this to highlight a number of implications for the talent debate. We then summarize some of the assumptions to identify nine tenets inherent in the talent perspective, and use ideas from an RBV perspective to challenge and critique this paradigm. This critique, we argue, should make us question the idea of “manageability” within the talent agenda. Many of the assumptions of a talent-management perspective are antithetical to the key principles and notions that underpin the RBV. We conclude by suggesting six developments to practice that should be made by adopting a more strategic RBV-influenced approach to talent management. The RBV perspective. The RBV tries to explain how some firms are able to sustain competitive advantage, and as a consequence they can continually earn superior profits compared to rival firms (Rumelt, 1984; Wernerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1986, 1991; Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Conner, 1991; Kogut and Zander, 1992; Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Peteraf, 1993; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen, 1997). The RBV locates these sources of advantage in the firm’s special assets and capabilities. These assets and capabilities have qualities, referred to as “isolating mechanisms” (Rumelt, 1984), that make it difficult for rival firms to replicate them and compete with the firm that has built these qualities. These isolating mechanisms include situations where:it is hard or even impossible to relate the consequences or effects of a phenomenon to its initial states or causes, and decision makers find it hard to understand the relationship between organizational inputs and outputs, referred to as “causal ambiguity”t he set of decisions one faces for any given circumstance is limited by the decisions one has made in the past, even though past circumstances may no longer be relevant (path dependency) interconnected social relationships and macro- and micro-factors of a social system create new properties (social complexity) knowledge is created that is difficult to capture, codify, or transfer, and people may not be aware of the knowledge they possess or how it can be valuable to others (tacit knowledge) complex synergies exist between assets, infrastructure, or capabilities. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,

Design/methodology/approach – Given the few contributions existing on the topic, and the lack of a general theory, a multiple case-study analysis seems appropriate to the topic. In particular, we present five case studies of European large firms, which have successfully internationalized in SMCs and MECs. In each firm, we interviewed local and foreign managers, in order to understand the importance of cultural issues and the ways companies overcame cultural distance. Findings – Cultural distance is a big problem for European firms investing in SMCs and MECs. They impact both intra- and inter-organizational relationships and cultural bridges can be useful to overcome the effects of its perception. Cultural bridges are effective if based on managers’ cultural competencies, and can be represented by a specific manager, or by an organizational unit. In any case, the involvement of local people and the adaptation to local customs are crucial. Research limitations/implications – The analysis is still limited, and, in the future, we’ll look for a methodology able to isolate cultural knowledge and cultural competence as key factors in order to evaluate the importance of each factor. Practical implications – When entering Islamic countries, foreign investors should be aware of local values, particularly religious and family value, which deeply impact on business and social relationships. Based on a deep cultural knowledge, cultural bridges enable fruitful relationships both inside and outside the organization. Originality/value – Whereas cultural competence is often mentioned in the literature, only a few contributions focus on cultural competence as a key aspect of internationalization.

Large corporations have provided a fundamental contribution to the wealth of nations and, at the same time, have had a remarkable impact on the political and social systems within which they have operated. It is difficult to understand the development of the most advanced economies if we do not consider the specific evolution of big business in every national case. On the other hand, it is not possible to explain the shape and behavior of big business without considering its development as part of the history of the country in which they operate. The largest US, German, British and French firms were key actors in favoring their nations' development and, even at the end of the Twentieth Century, made a very important contribution to their growth. In many countries, a stable core of large corporations developed only relatively lately, or did not develop at all, and under these circumstances, big business was not able to significantly participate in the economic growth of such countries. Scholars who dealt with the economic history of Italy and Spain are generally unanimous in tagging these nations as industrial late-comers, ineffective in promoting big autochthonous private and State-owned firms, dominated by family companies, and characterized by a strong competitive advantage on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, Spanish and Italian business and economic historians have tended to say little about the role and features of big business.This book thus fills a significant gap in the work on the development of Southern European capitalism and its large corporations by analyzing the Italian and Spanish cases and comparing them with each other and with what has occurred in the United States and in the largest European nations. Examining both the macro dynamics (national but also supra national) and the micro level, utilizing samples of big corporations and going deeply into some company cases, this volume identifies some important protagonists of the Italian and Spanish economies (such as the State, families and foreign investors) and investigates a wider panorama which includes the political, economic and social relationships of the corporations, providing insights into the form of capitalism that exists in these countries. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,

But in its screening of candidates, U.S. corporate business has lagged behind fields such as medicine and law, which in the nineteenth century addressed their need for screening by upgrading professional education and establishing licensing of individual practitioners. Corporate business, by contrast, has been too tolerant of problematic executives, particularly executives of a type shown by recent research in psychology to exhibit a set of personality traits including below average concern about bad effects of their actions on other people. Over-representation of this problematic type has cost corporate business the trust and respect it could earn by resting fully on a time-honored alternative foundation already espoused by many trustworthy teachers and practitioners of business. Society needs these trustworthy people of business to work together to establish screening of candidates for high level corporate positions by upgrading MBA education and establishing licensing for these positions. For reasons again based on current findings in psychology, screening candidates for the MBA could be significantly strengthened by requiring historical studies, particularly history of the corporate legal structure in the U.S. and history of the MBA itself. Upgrading the MBA and establishing correlated licensing could open the way toward corrections in the legal form of the corporation to bring it into line with hospitals, law courts and universities as places where responsible professionals pursue their callings on behalf of society. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Caveat emptor; Corporate structure; Dark triad; Education; History; Licensing; MBA; Personality; Stewardship; Temperament",

First, the distinction between the concepts of ""ethical"" and ""legal"" needs to be incorporated into theory building and empiricism. Second, a unifying theory is needed that can explain the variables that influence managers to emphasize ethics and legality in their judgments. Third, empirical evidence is needed to confirm the predictive power of the unifying theory, the discernable influence of personal and organizational variables, and the importance of the issue to the managers in determining their emphasis on the ethical and legal values of their judgments. Focused on these needs, the current research combines social identity theory with empirical findings from business ethics research. This theory building initiative framed hypothesis-driven research to investigate the influences on managers' emphasis on ethical and legal values in making business judgments. An empirical research study was conducted involving 252 practicing managers who judged 12 newsworthy business events. Data was collected on the managers' individual factors, on the groups that influence their judgments, and on the importance that the managers place on ethics and legality in judging the 12 scenarios. The research findings contribute to theory development (1) By successfully utilizing a blended extension of social identity and issue-contingent theories to understand managers' judgments, and (2) By providing evidence on the relationships between the perceived importance of an issue and the emphases managers place on ethical and legal values in their judgments. The analysis of the data was extended to provide insights on the needs of employers to tailor management training on legal and ethical decision-making. The participating managers were clustered according to their emphases on Ethical Importance and Legal Importance in judging business situations.

Design/methodology/approach: A content analysis of Woolworths' comprehensive 2008-2011 sustainability and annual reports examined how this retail chain evaluates and implements its sustainable business practices. Findings: The results indicate that such indicators play a significant role in evaluating and implementing various Woolworths' business practices aimed at sustainability. In addition, Woolworths' comprehensive governance system ensures that its sustainable business practices are implemented and targets achieved. Research limitations/implications: The case study demonstrates that businesses can remain profitable, while at the same time protecting the natural environment and striving for sustainable business practices. Practical implications: This example demonstrates how government influence, institutional mechanisms and senior management commitment to a project ultimately has gone some way to minimise barriers to the adoption of sustainable practices. Originality/value: The example provides not only a seed of knowledge for others in retailing, but also guidance to both practice in general and theory in the field of sustainable business practices. It demonstrates how an organization has taken strategic action, extended this beyond the firm's boundaries and into the supply chain.

This consideration implies that it becomes more and more important/urgent to measure and report intellectual capital. The new reporting statement (intellectual capital report) is not yet commonly used by firms, but many, on a voluntary basis, already publish environmental, social and sustainability reports, which contain much information on intangibles. Starting from this point, the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to integrate the information contained in both reports in a single ad hoc integrated document, having both external and internal communication aims. Design/methodology/approach: The paper addresses three research questions: whether the theoretical premises exist for the integration of the two different frameworks; which frameworks should be chosen as a starting point; and which features should have an integrated framework. Theoretical premises for integration have been found in the research-based view (RBV) theory. To chose the social report and intellectual capital report (ICR) framework to use as starting points, the authors analyze the frameworks from the intellectual capital (IC) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature; then choose the frameworks (GRI3 and Meritum reports) founded on an evolved notion of, respectively, corporate responsibility and IC, which share the same features - the orientation towards stakeholders, the managerial approach, and the focus on intangible activities that a new integrated framework should respect. Findings: Starting from the selected CSR and ICR frameworks, the authors planned and designed a new, ad hoc model of corporate communication, able to integrate the social and intangible dimensions in a single document, named the Intangible Global Report (IGR). The IGR framework is composed of five dimensions, three derived from the ICR (human capital, structural capital, relational capital) and two from the GRI report (environmental, social). The different aspects of each dimension are surveyed in terms of intangible resources, activities and impacts, measured by financial and non-financial indicators. Originality/value: The main originality of the paper consists in providing a general framework for firms to integrate all their intangible information in a single document - the IGR framework - focused on the firm's strategy, which allows the stakeholder to visualize all the firm's intangibles, how a company conducts its activities and the impacts that such activities have on the environmental, social and IC dimensions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Corporate social responsibility; Framework; Indicators; Intangibles; Integration; Intellectual capital",

Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative research where content analysis is used to analyse leading property companies' websites, annual reports, corporate responsibility and sustainability reports, and carbon disclosure reports. Findings: Findings from this research indicate that the majority of the developers have their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in place and there are variations in their approaches and reporting process. Of all, philanthropic activities are the mostly widely reported followed by human resource initiatives. Even though the majority of property companies reported their environmental practices, only the top few developers had their projects certified by sustainability rating agencies. Research limitations/implications: As this project was restricted to the top ten Malaysian developers, the results do not reflect how other companies, particularly the smaller ones, adopt CSR in their business. However, this project revealed valuable findings regarding the magnitude of CSR initiatives, particularly on social and environmental perspective, adopted by the top ten Malaysian property developers; this is useful for the Malaysian government authorities in formulating CSR-related policies particularly on environmental sustainability. As well, the findings of this project can be a useful reference to other property companies which are keen to contribute to sustainable development, particularly on social and environmental perspectives. Originality/value: There has been limited literature on CSR in the Malaysian property industry thus far. Previous research papers are mainly about environmental sustainability of property companies, sustainable practice by Malaysian real estate investment trusts, and CSR perception of house buyers and developers.

As a result of the request, David immerses himself in the task in order to identify, within generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), opportunities to reclassify R&D expenses to cost of goods sold. He ultimately proposes three separate reclassification entries that, although technically within GAAP guidelines, involve the use of accounting discretion.

But organizational downsizing not only cannot surely improves firm performance, but also harms thousands of employees and their families. A number of scholars investigating organizational change suggest that 'a responsible downsizing strategy' can mitigate or solve this issue. As the major stakeholder in downsizing, labor unions naturally negotiate with firms to protect employee rights and benefits. Their negotiation, therefore, may either enhance or mitigate the effect of responsible downsizing strategy on firm performance. This study used a sample of 154 downsized local firms and multinational corporations in Taiwan to examine the research construct, and invited focus groups to have a further validated explanation. The findings show that labor union negotiation may act as either stepping stones or stumbling blocks. The results indicate that firms employing labor union negotiation experience higher downsizing performance than non-unionized firms do. However, labor union interventions can also become stumbling blocks. Labor union negotiation neutralize the positive effect of employee-caring practices on downsizing performance, leading to a decline in downsizing performance when firms increase employee participation and justice consideration in the downsizing process. The research findings provide implications for further scholarly research and management practices in terms of organization change, stakeholder management and labor-management relationship. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","firm performance; labor union negotiation; multinational corporation; responsible downsizing strategy; stakeholder influence strategy",

In the past, mining operations frequently stood accused of being socially and environmentally disruptive, whereas mining today invests heavily in 'socially responsible' and 'sustainable' business practices. Changes such as these can be witnessed internationally as well as in places like Western Australia (WA), where the mining sector has matured into an economic pillar of the state, and indeed the nation in the context of the recent resources boom. This paper explores the role of mining in WA, presenting a multidisciplinary perspective on the sector's contribution to sustainable development in the state. The perspectives offered here are drawn from community-based research and the associated academic literature as well as data derived from government sources and the not-for-profi t sector. Findings suggest that despite noteworthy attitudinal and operational improvements in the industry, social, economic and environmental problem areas remain. As mining in WA is expected to grow in the years to come, these problem areas require the attention of business and government alike to ensure the long-term sustainability of development as well as people and place.

These considerations are increasingly reflected in corporate sustainability reporting, i.e., statements reflecting the impact of business practices related to economic, environmental and social perspectives. However, the data contained in such documents are reported independently of the financial aspects, implying a disconnection between the three pillars of business strategy. In order to avoid this shortcoming, some leading companies have developed integrated reporting, which expresses the interconnections between a firm's strategy, governance, performance and prospects, as well as the contexts within which it operates. The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of one of the most important institutional factors, the legal system, on the development of integrated reports. The analysis of a non-balanced sample of 750 international companies for the years 2008-2010, in which a logit methodology is applied to panel data, reveals the impact of this institutional factor. The results show that companies located in civil law countries, and where indices of law and order are high, are more likely to create and publish a broad range of integrated reports, thus favouring decision-taking by the different stakeholders. On the basis of these findings, two policy recommendations are proposed: first, it may be necessary to establish national laws and protection mechanisms to promote and ensure holistic transparency. Second, managers must be able to decide on the appropriate disclosure practices in the context of their own legal environment in order to obtain maximum benefits from their decisions. The results should be considered as having only preliminary value due to the limited number of firms that disclose this typology of reporting, and because of the limitations of the data sample. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Robin Attfield explained how individuals should be understood to be culpable for these harms. In this paper, I use a critical analysis of Attfield's explanatory framework to explore further difficulties in accounting for corporate responsibility for these harms. I begin by arguing that there are some problems with his framework as it is applied to individuals that emit greenhouse gases (GHGs). I then show that it will be very difficult to extend this framework to corporations. This is not a criticism of Attfield's work (as he does not discuss corporate responsibility for those harms associated with GCC), but it will serve to show the difficulty in philosophically explaining corporations' moral culpability when it comes to these harms. In fact, one positive conclusion of this paper is that it highlights a new area of concern that has been ignored in discussions of corporate responsibilities-that of mediated responsibilities-which is how Attfield understands our responsibilities regarding GCC. The discussion of this concern will draw attention to another positive conclusion of this paper: the harms associated with CO2 are very unlike the harms associated with other airborne-emitted substances, which will indicate that we will need new ways of understanding how individuals and corporations are philosophically responsible for these harms.

The literature distinguishes three strategies that corporations commonly employ to respond to legitimacy problems: adapt to external expectations, manipulate the perception of their stakeholders, or engage in a discourse with those who question their legitimacy. We discuss three approaches to determine the appropriate response strategy: one-best-way approach, contingency approach, and paradox approach. We argue that in the face of heterogeneous environments with conflicting demands, corporations that follow a paradox approach are likely to be more successful in preserving their legitimacy than those that adopt one of the other two approaches. We develop a theoretical framework for the application of different response strategies and explore the management of paradoxes by way of structural, contextual, or reflective means. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.","Corporate legitimacy; Corporate responsibility; Globalization; Institutional theory; Paradox; Sustainability",

The benefits of CR for organizations are, however, often said to be achieved through increased support of stakeholders. Despite this, limited attention has been given to understanding CR from the perspective of stakeholders and, in particular, the mechanism by which CR drives stakeholder support. This study addresses this deficit. Building on advances in the application of psychological theories to the field of management, the research develops and empirically tests a theoretical model of how CR-related experiences and beliefs drive stakeholder trust and positive intent. The research is conducted with customers (n=708) and employees (n=359) of a service organization in the UK that introduced a range of CR-related activities into their business. The findings contribute to literature by empirically demonstrating (a) the impact of CR-related experiences on the development of beliefs about, and trust towards, the organization; (b) the importance of 'others-related' CR experiences even in the presence of 'self-related' CR experiences; and (c) the role of beliefs as partial mediators in how experiences of CR, both 'self-related' and 'others-related', translate into trust and positive intent. © 2011 The Author(s).

Over the past 25 years attempts have been made to improve this through the medium of successive, evolving versions of a Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) for charities. As a foundation for the future review of the SORP (expected to be published in 2015), the SORP Committee undertook its largest ever consultation on an accounting pronouncement.

Design/methodology/approach: To explain the (on-going) change-management process, the authors retrospectively applied change-management literature to the implicit process in which they have, themselves, been intimately involved. Findings: The implicit change-management process had unconsciously mobilized a variety of tactics identified in the change-management literature; a more explicit articulation of the ""as-is"" and ""desired"" states, and a more explicit, systematic and regular communication of the journey and goal, might have enabled faster progress. However, the nature of a highly autonomous and decentralized organization, such as an academic institution, means that sustainable change management may be slower than in commercial institutions. Research limitations/implications: The authors have been closely engaged in the change-management process they describe and, inevitably, have unconscious biases and partial perspectives.

The survey measures willingness to engage in white-collar crime behaviors, some clearly illegal; others marginally unethical. Findings show an increase in tolerance for clearly illegal behaviors from 2001 to 2009 and an increase in tolerance for an even broader array of unethical acts from 2009 to 2010. As compared with 2001 respondents, 2009 respondents were more tolerant of seriously illegal behaviors but less tolerant of marginally unethical ones. In 2010, respondents were more accepting of both kinds of unethical behaviors.

The predominant response of researchers and policymakers has been to focus on the external impact of business operations and the merits of regulation or persuasion in achieving more responsible practice in these areas. In this article, we focus on a less well explored aspect of CSR, namely the evaluation of an organization's CSR activities by its internal stakeholders (i.e., employees). Salient CSR literature is reviewed to differentiate between CSR and ethical business practice (EBP), conceptualizing the latter as the internal manifestation of CSR as represented by an organization's values and vision, strategy and policy, systems and procedures, and people management practices. This article assesses organizational espousal of EBP in three ways: how successfully it is communicated to employees, how closely espousal aligns with employee expectation, and how this evaluation impacts on employee commitment. Our research approach aligns with and extends previous work in this area that identifies the likelihood of a ""false consensus bias"" by managers in assuming congruence between organization espousal of EBP and employee expectation. A conceptual model is offered to explain possible employee responses to an organization's EBP. This relates organization espousal of EBP to employee assessment of its salience to identify three positions on commitment that employees can adopt-abrogated, continuance, and affective commitment-together with their likely behavioral implications. The analysis generates a series of research questions and related areas of exploration to empirically test the conceptual model. © 2013 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

The objective of this paper is to make the case for why internal and external auditors should leverage the capabilities process mining offers to rethink how auditing is carried out. We do so by identifying the sources of value added of process mining when applied to auditing, which are as follows: 1. process mining analyzes the entire population of data and not just a sample; 2. critically that data consists of meta-data-data entered independently of the actions of auditee-and not just data entered by the auditee; 3. process mining allows the auditor to have a more effective way of implementing the audit risk model by providing effective ways of conducting the required walkthroughs of processes and conducting analytic procedures; 4. process mining allows the auditor to conduct analyses not possible with existing audit tools, such as discovering the ways in which business processes are actually being carried out in practice, and to identify social relationships between individuals. It is our argument that these sources of value have not been fully understood in the process mining literature, which has focused on developing it as a statistical methodology rather than on applying it to audit practice.

Design/methodology/approach: By developing a processual analysis of techno-change, useful insights are developed concerning techno-change alignment, within the confines of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) case study. Recent techno-change literature, emerging ideas on human agency, cultural and social relations are incorporated as part of the evaluation approach taken. The paper also discusses the implications of more recent work on techno-change and suggests directions for future research. Findings: In terms of ""structural"" alignment, the ERP system was chosen because it reflected requirements of the case study in the university/education sector. As part of ""strategic and intellectual"" alignment, business processes were reviewed, as well as alignment with university aims and strategy goals. ""Social and cultural"" alignment between different groups of users is paramount for effective integration and re-embedding of relationships and activities once techno-change is introduced. Wider implications of processual alignment suggest that bringing users and stakeholders together as human agents for techno-change within a high priority communication environment is essential for developing effective social relationships. Originality/value: Given the difficulty of developing usable evaluation mechanisms for techno-change and complex enterprise information systems, the contribution of this article is the demonstration of an effective interpretative (processual) IS evaluation approach, which the authors refer to as ""techno-change alignment"". © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","ERP; Information systems alignment; Organizational change; Strategic evaluation; Techno-change; Technology",

We argue that even though stakeholder orientation offers a broader inclusion of values and expectations than market orientation, they share considerable similarities in terms of sustainability assumptions and how the role of the corporation becomes perceived in the quest for sustainable development. Both strategies leave responsibility outside the firm by emphasising the role of either customers or stakeholders as the basis of strategizing. Both strategies are also based on assumptions consistent with weak sustainability (at best), which is argued to be insufficient in order to achieve sustainability over time and space. Therefore, this article suggests that a new orientation is needed if corporations are to contribute to sustainable development, namely sustainable development orientation. We call for further research in outlining a business strategy that admits corporations' responsibility for sustainable development and departs from the strong sustainability assumption. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the process, the relationships between executive compensation and financial performance, and corporate social performance and financial performance are examined to determine whether potential compensation and social performance links are coming at the expense of company financial performance. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical data for this research were obtained from a stratified sample of Fortune 1000 companies pulled from across more than 15 industries. Multiple regression analysis is utilized to test three hypotheses. Findings - In line with the hypotheses, results indicate that companies identified as good corporate social performers do in fact have lower levels of executive compensation and there is some support found for a positive relationship between social and financial performance. Practical implications - The results provide support for the view that firms concerned about social responsibility can put restrictions on executive compensation and still achieve good financial performance, and make a case that executive compensation should in fact be a concern of all socially responsible firms. Originality/value - There are few studies that examine the direct link between executive compensation and corporate social responsibility. This study addresses this gap in the literature and adds to the discussion as to whether socially responsible firms might seek to better balance compensation across the firm and emphasize that profit, both individual and corporate, must be earned within a system that is fair and balanced for all. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Compensation; Competitive strategy; Empirical research; Service strategy; Servicescape; Social responsibility",

A total of 22 definitions for GSCM and 12 definitions for SSCM were identified. In order to analyze the identified definitions, two different sets of key characteristics for business sustainability (i.e., economic, environmental, social, stakeholder, volunteer, resilience, and long-term focuses) and SCM (i.e., flow, coordination, stakeholder, relationship, value, efficiency, and performance focuses) were proposed. The identified definitions were analyzed against each other and the two sets of proposed key characteristics. The analysis shows that definitions for GSCM were generally more narrowly focused than those for SSCM and had an emphasis on the characteristics of environmental, flow, and coordination focuses. Though some definitions of SSCM show considerable overlap with definitions of GSCM, it is argued that SSCM is essentially an extension of GSCM. Several identified definitions addressed at least half of the proposed key business sustainability and SCM characteristics. However, no complete definition of GSCM or SSCM was identified.

Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected by KLD Research Analytics and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the study examines the association between companies' choice of approaches to the CSR and CSR-CP relationship. Findings: Results of this study indicate that each of the three approaches to CSR - descriptive, instrumental, and strategic - are associated with CP, but in different ways. While the instrumental approach to CSR has a positive association with short-term measures of CP, the strategic approach is associated with short-term and medium-term measures of CP, and the descriptive approach has no definite association with CP at all. Originality/value: This study integrates the prevailing justifications for CSR with the taxonomy of approaches to CSR - instrumental, descriptive and strategic - suggested in the literature.

Design/methodology/approach: The intrinsic stakeholder framework forms the basis of the qualitative, longitudinal analysis. It is adopted as the moral ground for the provision of a ""complete"" account of employee issues. In seeking to shed light on the organisation-society relationship and its implications for reporting on employee issues the authors build a broader theoretical framework incorporating various social and political theories dealing with legitimacy, political economy, and language and rhetoric. Interpretive and critical approaches are employed. The analysis draws on an extensive review of published materials relating to employment in the UK retail banking industry and NatWest in particular, impacts of workplace changes occurring in the banking sector, and to the economic, social and political environment over the period of the study. Findings: The findings indicate that what and how NatWest reported on employee issues was influenced by considerations other than transparency and employee accountability. The analysis highlights the complexity of the role of disclosures in the organisation-society relationship and consequently the limitations of the use of a single theoretical framework to interpret disclosures. Research limitations/implications: The longitudinal analysis indicates how reporting practices are issue and context dependent and points to the limitations of theorising in corporate social reporting based on a single time frame and a limited analysis of the reported issues. Practical implications: In highlighting a lack of accountability to employees, the findings have implications for the development of reporting standards on issues relevant to employees. Over time, it is hoped that development of an employee inclusive reporting framework, along with exposure of the contradictory role that reports may play in promoting accountability, will contribute toward improved employee management practices. Originality/value: This study contributes to the corporate social reporting literature by extending the analysis beyond the firm focused stakeholder management perspective to considering disclosures from a moral perspective and the extent to which the complex organisation-society relationship might work against the promotion of transparency and accountability toward stakeholders (specifically employees). In this way, through an in-depth longitudinal analysis of disclosures from multiple perspectives, the paper contributes to theorising of the role of social disclosure in the organisation-society relationship. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banking; Employee disclosures; Legitimacy; Political economy; Rhetoric; Stakeholder accountability; Stakeholders; United Kingdom",

The paper first provides a literature review of research in the areas of ethics pertaining to marketing professionals. Then a review of a wide variety of codes of business ethics, marketing ethics, model codes, and professional ethics produces the idea that, while there are some differences in how the codal principles are presented, there are sufficient similarities in the codes' principles of professional conduct to merit the consideration of a single code of marketing ethics - one that can be used regardless of the venue or specialty of the marketing professional. Design/methodology/approach: The paper introduces a broad literature review followed by the development of a transcendent code of ethics for all marketers. Findings: Using the above as well as: historically and more broadly known theories of ethics, and currently-used codes of professional marketing ethics, including those from the American Marketing Association (AMA), the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA), and the Sales and Marketing Executives International (SMEI), the authors make an attempt to determine the most prominent, efficacious principles of ethics and to shape a single code of professional conduct for marketing students, educators and practitioners - regardless of their area of specialty. Research limitations/implications: The proposed code is subject to debate and will likely not be the model eventually used. The authors hope that the code proposed will stimulate further research, discussion and formulation. Practical implications: A single code of ethics that could be utilized by anyone confronted with an ethical marketing issue would be useful in easing the difficulties associated with challenging ethical dilemmas in marketing. Social implications: Drawing on traditional frames of ethics and combining those principles with principles found in the marketing ethics literature, the authors generate a single code of ethics that not only marketers can use, but that others in society can also identify with and feel confidence in - thus alleviating concerns of mistrust or misunderstanding between those marketing products and services and the stakeholders in the society in which those products and services are being marketed. Originality/value: No transcendent code of marketing ethics currently exists. The three most prominent are unique to their fields - each leaving out portions necessary to be transcendent.

Hence, virtue ethicists ride happily to the rescue, offering to replace or complement Kant's theory with their own. Before such efforts are undertaken, however, one should recognize that Kant himself wrote a ""virtue theory"" (Tugendlehre), wherein he discussed the questions of character as well as the teleological nature of human action. Numerous Kant scholars argue that Kant already erected precisely the kind of integrative moral architecture that some of his modern interpreters (while aiming to supersede him) wish to construct. For business ethics, this divergence of scholarly opinion is of crucial importance. It shows first that the standard portrayals of Kant's ethics in business ethics textbooks-as rigidly deontological, narrowly individualistic, and hence unsuitable for the specific demands of corporate agency-might have to be revised. Second, discussions in the business ethics literature on stakeholder-engagement and managerial decision-making likewise stand to gain from a more nuanced picture of Kant's moral philosophy. Third, a reassessment of Kant's ethics with regard to questions of personal character and moral sentiments might also lead to a more favorable view of the relevance of his ethics for managerial practice. Last, but not least, the many current attempts to reconcile Kant's freedom-oriented philosophy with virtue theories stand to benefit considerably from a better understanding of how Kant himself conceived of one such synthesis between the formal and substantial aspects of morality. This, ultimately, could lead to an important overlapping consensus in the academic literature as to the role and relevance of virtuous conduct in business. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Deontology; Formalism; Kant; Kantian; Teleology; Virtue ethics",

Particular attention is given to the fundamental emphasis placed by Soto in distinguishing between commerce as an activity and the specific conduct of persons engaging in commercial activity. The distinction between the material and the formal parts of the common good is then employed to shed light on the way Soto articulates commercial practices, virtuous character, and the common good. It is concluded that Soto's major contribution for business ethics is clarifying that the key element for the ethical evaluation of commerce is the embodiment of virtuous personal conduct in the exercise of commercial activity. In this framework, the fulfillment of commerce's potential to contribute to the common good is thus fundamentally interconnected with putting virtues into practice. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Character; Commerce; Commercial practices; Common good principle; Domingo de Soto; School of Salamanca; Virtue",

We analyze the disclosures of the 100 U.S. Best Corporate Citizens in the period 2005-2007, and we posit a series of simultaneous relationships between different attributes of the governance system and a multidimensional construct of corporate social performance (CSP). We consider both the extent and the quality of SED, with the purpose of identifying increasing levels of corporate commitment to stakeholders and shedding some light on whether SED is used as a signal or rather as a legitimacy tool. Our empirical evidence shows that the stakeholders' orientation of corporate governance is positively associated with CSP and SED. On the other hand, we do not find support for the monitoring intensity of corporate governance being negatively associated with social performance. We also find that CSP in the ""product"" dimension is positively associated with the extent and quality of SED whilst CSP in the ""people"" dimension is negatively associated with the extent and quality of SED.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via a qualitative research design from four seniors' clubs in Australia using focus groups (12), and participant observation. The data were analyzed using QSR NVivo software using an interpretive approach. Findings: Ten themes based on 34 codes were identified in the study, which were grouped to develop a conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences of seniors' empowerment in third places for further testing. The themes under consumer empowerment were important in assisting to understand the significance of place and social engagement within the place to empower seniors with a positive self-image, better access to information and exercise of choices for smarter purchase decisions. The themes under social capital contributed to a better understanding of the ramification of social capital to marketing knowledge. This was particularly so for marketing constructs embedded in community or aggregate level issues such as value co-creation, relationship marketing, customer involvement and related outcomes. Finally the study reports three types of loyalty: cognitive, ultimate and communal loyalty, that underpinned the behavioral, attitudinal and cognitive dimension of loyalty. The findings suggested that consequent to seniors' social capital and feeling of empowerment in third places they display loyalty to the third place. Research limitations/implications: The present study has three theoretical implications; first, it extends knowledge into the notion of third place which underlies the broader domain of servicescape. It also extends understanding of the significance of third places in practicing consumer centric marketing through consumer empowerment. The study also contributes to understanding how third places enhance seniors' social capital through social engagement. Practical implications: The managerial implications suggested by the findings provide a number of aspects that managers may consider in relation to service places in three key broad categories of customer-firm interest: improve customer patronage through community engagement, improve local business practices via customer-owner friendship, and redesigning spatial settings to deliver meaningful customer experiences. Originality/value: This paper uses the concepts of social engagement within customer community in third places for the development of social capital and empowerment. It provides a customer centric focus to servicescape and incorporates recent works on third places, empowerment, social capital and loyalty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Customer loyalty; Empowerment; Loyalty; Older consumers; Seniors; Social capital; Third places",

We address two recent trends in corporate communication: corporate disclosure, that is the adoption of consistent external reporting standards [namely the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)], and the growing awareness of engagement with and impact on local communities through philanthropy, generation of prosperity, communication and the social impact of core activities. This study uses a comparative qualitative case approach to forest industry multinational enterprises (MNEs) based on a combination of secondary (reporting, company newsletters and other documentation) and interview data. Three large-scale multinational forest industry firms, all pursuing different strategies in terms of internationalisation and geographical and product diversification, were chosen for the study: Stora Enso, SCA and Sappi Ltd. Our results show that the overall quality of sustainability reporting has improved in these companies from 2005 to 2009 with the adoption of GRI. However, based on our fourfold categorisation of social impact, the core social impact indicator in GRI (SO1) has been interpreted very differently in these MNEs, and the adoption of GRI has not actually much improved the comparability of the reports or transparency of practices. © 2013 The Authors.",,

Education in business ethics was found to be positively associated with the two identified factors of moral attentiveness, ""reflective"" and ""perceptual"" moral attentiveness, and with the PRESOR ""stakeholder view"" factor. Also, reflective moral attentiveness was found to act as a mediator in the relationship between education in business ethics and the PRESOR stakeholder view factor.

From the perspective of public agencies the relationship between expectations, experiences and satisfaction of infrastructure stakeholders affected by road maintenance is explored. Drawing upon data collected during a road maintenance project in the Netherlands it is shown that expectations only played a minor role in the formation of satisfaction. Moreover, depending on the contextual setting of the maintenance project, the importance of highway performance impacts for the formation of satisfaction through expectations and experiences changed. The results suggest that the value-in-use experience and the time dependence of expectations account for the switch in importance and the limited role of expectations. A main conclusion is that road agencies should redirect their effort from trying to determine and meet stakeholder expectations to allowing stakeholders to experience the improvements of a maintenance project. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Expectation-disconfirmation theory; road maintenance; stakeholder management","Expectation-disconfirmation theory; Exploratory studies; Maintenance projects; Performance impact; Public agencies; Road maintenance; Service provisions; Stakeholder management; Maintenance; Roads and streets; infrastructure; maintenance; project management; road construction; stakeholder; Netherlands"

The purpose of this paper is to respond to this omission by exploring the green consumers' product demands and consumption processes. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured in-depth interviews with Portuguese green consumers are used to discuss potential key factors (reasons to buy green products, defining green product characteristics, feelings about pricing, perceived product confidence, willingness to compromise, environmental knowledge, consideration of alternatives, product's point of purchase and use and disposal). Findings: The analysis indicates that green consumers represent an artificial segment and provides further empirical support to the definition of sustainability as a market-oriented concept. The paper's findings suggest that mainstreaming green products is a more positive alternative than green segmentation. Research limitations/implications: This research is exploratory in nature and the authors followed established guidelines to ensure objectivity. However, the study's findings are restricted to Portuguese green consumers and a replication in other countries would help to remove any potential country bias. Practical implications: Sustainable businesses are eager to learn who the green consumer is in order to define this market segment. This may not represent the best strategy, however. Targeting green products to a niche market based only on intangible environmental or ethical values may not only be hindering the progress of sustainability as a market-oriented concept but also missing the huge opportunity of gaining competitive advantage in the inevitable future marketplace. Originality/value: Most marketing studies were unsuccessful in segmenting green consumers even ""on average"", resulting in elusive and contradictory outcomes. Only very few studies are aimed at exploring the green consumer's behavior using qualitative research approaches.

Furthermore, the paper aims to explore the function of economic development in altering the role of social relationships in service quality evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: Consistent with the critical realism paradigm a multi-method design is adopted for this study. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's structuralist perspective of culture is utilised as the analytical framework. Findings: The findings challenge both marketing and sociology theory that propose that individuals are less focussed on nurturing inter-personal relationships as they are empowered economically. Indeed it is found that social networks (i.e. social capital) perform a key role in service quality preference formation and dissemination. The evidence suggests that economic development has not mitigated the influence of social relationships upon service consumption. Research limitations/implications: The paper identifies a research agenda towards developing a measure of service quality that more comprehensively probes the social element of the service encounter. In order to more fully explore the impact of economic capital on the service quality construct it is identified that a longitudinal study is required that focuses upon nations as they transition from developing to developed nation status. Practical implications: This study has significant implications for marketing managers seeking to build a presence in Taiwan or other similarly profiled Confucian based societies. It is advised that strategists should adopt a customised strategic plan when operating within Taiwan and similarly profiled cultures. In particular this study encourages a focus upon nurturing inter-personal relationships and leveraging these relationships to effectively communicate to target markets in Confucian societies.

I propose a conception of inquiry according to which epistemic actions involve investigation, belief adoption and justification, and relate this to the traditional 'justified true belief' analysis of knowledge. I defend the view that epistemic virtues enable and/or motivate people to perform epistemic actions. An examination of the key epistemic virtues of love of knowledge, epistemic courage, temperance, justice, generosity and humility provides some initial evidence suggesting that the way epistemic virtues enable or motivate is by countering a number of biases that have been uncovered by behavioural economics, and also indicates ways in which the instrumental epistemic value view is superior to other approaches to epistemic virtue offered in the literature. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Epistemic virtues; Information; Information sharing; Knowledge; Search behaviour; Virtue theory",

In the last decade, numerous scandals and consequently many corporate crises in the global business world have added credence to the criticisms of business ethics. Therefore, it is vital to understand the factors affecting employees' ethical decision making. Culture also has a strong impact on decision making. Paternalism is the combination of strong discipline, subordinate loyalty, and the superior's generous concern for that subordinate, culminating in a more intricate and dominating relationship in the organization. A paternalist culture, by its very nature, has a powerful impact on decision making. Investigating the various factors affecting the decision-making process guides practitioners and managers toward taking the necessary steps to prevent unethical events in the future. In this study, the impacts of positive perception of distributive justice and performance appraisal fairness on employees' ethical decision making in paternalist organizational culture are investigated. The total sample (N = 107) contained white-collar employees working in five small-medium enterprises in Turkey. The data was analyzed using correlation and regression analysis.

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the management literature on CSR, corporate social performance and the benefits of a socially responsible behaviour, a conceptual framework of corporate responsibility management is presented. The Gap Inc. case is analyzed to prove how CSR commitment creates stakeholder partnerships and improves corporate brand image. Findings: The main output of corporate responsibility management is solid stakeholder relationships resulting in: employee attraction and motivation, powerful brand, enhanced consumer perceptions, profitability. Through the corporate responsibility management process, fast fashion companies can obtain a sustainable development. Originality/value: Existing CSR research is primarily focused on a specific level of analysis. Instead the corporate responsibility management framework aims to contribute to a comprehensive analysis of CSR. Moreover it addresses the role of CSR practices in the fast fashion sector which has been rarely investigated to date. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Fashion; Fast fashion; Gap Inc. case; Social responsibility",

Satisfying stakeholder expectations and needs through transparent corporate activities may actually improve a firm's reputation and financial results. With an empirical study of the CSP disclosures of large German listed firms, we tested the hypothesized causal relationship between CSP and corporate financial performance (CFP). We measure CSP as an equal weighted CSP-Index based on Global Reporting Initiative's social and environmental core key performance indicators. CFP is measured by return on assets. Based on correlation and regression analyses, we find support for a positive and significant interaction between CSP and CFP for large German listed firms. Our findings indicate that the CSP-CFP relationship is affected by the degree of innovation. Furthermore, there is evidence for a unidirectional Granger causal relationship running from CFPt-1 to CSPt. Thus, firms with superior CFP may use their surplus of monetary or non-monetary resources for further improvements of their CSP. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Corporate social disclosure; Corporate social performance; Corporate social performance index; CSP-CFP-relation",

The paper then seeks to examine the impacts of these two antecedents on the management practices of the two key stakeholders (the hotel owner and the customer) and to assess the effects of these practices on organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical survey using questionnaires was conducted on a sample of 228 three- to five-star hotels in China. The results from confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were both satisfactory, providing a basis for discussion. Findings: Three main results emerged. First, in model A, the key stakeholder is the hotel investor: both antecedent constructs, trust and commitment, were positively influenced by the organization's stakeholder management practices. However, in model B, the key stakeholder is the customer; trust was the only construct affected by stakeholder management practices. The second major result was that in both models, stakeholder management practices had positive and significant influences on financial performance and customer satisfaction. Finally, the results revealed that customer satisfaction positively affected financial performance. Originality/value: The proposed framework and its results provide vital insights for industry practitioners and academics in the field of stakeholder management, where an alternative competitive strategy for an organization's wealth creation is acknowledged. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Commitment; Hospitality services; Organizational performance; Relationship quality; Stakeholder analysis; Stakeholder management; Trust",

Significant suspicion nonetheless remains about the motives and impact of corporations acting in domains traditionally served by government and ""third-sector"" organizations. We argue that such ambivalence undermines the perceived legitimacy of private investments in public goods, and that this fundamental liability of privateness (LOP) constitutes a significant obstacle to corporations acting in the public domain through corporate citizenship initiatives. For multinational corporations (MNCs), the challenges stemming from the LOP are further amplified by the liability of foreignness (LOF) commonly associated with international business operations. We discuss the origins of the LOP and derive implications of the ""dual liability"" of LOP and LOF for partnering choices in MNCs' corporate citizenship programs. We highlight limitations on the set of credible governance mechanisms available to participants in these partnerships, describe a set of alternative governance arrangements that serve to realign incentives among alliance partners, and link these to the severity of the LOP in a particular setting.

While liberal commentators argue that corporations can act as protectors of citizenship rights where state regulation is lacking, more radical commentators claim that corporations seek to obstruct the rights of citizens. In this article we build on theories of hegemony to argue that corporate citizenship can be more fruitfully understood as an attempt to incorporate citizenship activities in order to benefit corporate agendas. To explore how this process plays out, we examine how companies have sought to influence the political debate over climate change in Australia. Through analysis of corporate documents, media coverage and interviews with senior managers, we identify how corporations use practices of campaigning and exemplifying to build a common identity with citizens and synchronize corporate and citizen interests. This involves the recasting of citizens as active constituents, responsible consumers, ethical employees and ecopreneurs. Through this process, citizenship becomes increasingly incorporated within the value creating activities of corporations. © The Author(s) 2013.","climate change; corporate citizenship; corporate political activity; hegemony; sustainability",

From this the authors argue that the most significant challenge is the role business schools should play in the resolution of urgent global issues. The paper then details and analyses the research and provides recommendations. Findings: The authors argue that the most significant challenge is the role business schools should play in the resolution of urgent global issues. The main finding from the research was that the leaders of participating business schools did not convey the impression that steering business toward helping humanity achieve a sustainable future and tackling urgent global issues was seen by them as one of their main current or future roles.

Design/methodology/approach: The framework outlined is the result of more than two decades of action research. This has involved an iterative process of framework design and field testing with clients to assess validity followed by redesign. This evolution has been conducted in conjunction with a continuous review of progress in the strategy-related literature. Findings: For many directors, managers, consultants and academics, there is a disconnect between strategy and what is often referred to as ""stakeholder management"". In the latter, stakeholders are the first and final focus. Such a perspective might suit the needs and language of fields like public policy, social services, welfare and ethics, but it isn't appropriate for strategy and strategic planning. Being stakeholder-centric, it holds back the acceptance of a stakeholder framework in strategy. The firm-centric stakeholder framework for strategy gels with boards, CEOs and senior executives, focusing as it does on the long-term prosperity and sustainability of an organization. Originality/value: Organizations in all sectors - business, government and not-for-profit - can benefit greatly by re-orienting their thinking and the way they go about designing strategy and structuring their strategic plans.

Sustainable supply chain initiatives like supplier environmental and social collaboration can play a significant role in achieving the ""triple bottom line"" of social, environmental, and economic benefits. Supplier selection plays an important role in the management of a supply chain. Traditionally, organizations consider criteria such as price, quality, flexibility, etc. when evaluating supplier performance. While the articles on the selection and evaluation of suppliers are abundant, those that consider sustainability issues are rather limited. This paper explores sustainable supply chain initiatives and examines the problem of identifying an effective model based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach (economic, environmental, and social aspects) for supplier selection operations in supply chains by presenting a fuzzy multi criteria approach. We use triangular fuzzy numbers to express linguistic values of experts' subjective preferences. Qualitative performance evaluation is performed by using fuzzy numbers for finding criteria weights and then fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is proposed for finding the ranking of suppliers.

CSR arose out of the success of large American corporations of the early 20th century in preventing unionization or significant regulation of their workplaces, a success that required firms to assume responsibility for employee welfare, not only to promote efficiency and prevent a resurgence of labour activism, but also to reassure traditionalists concerned with new white collar employment relations. Corporate executives discovered that positive publicity with regard to personnel policies helped them manage other controversies, so after World War I, some began to extend claims of being responsible employers to argue for a more comprehensive set of social responsibilities. The onset of the Depression and its aftermath reduced the significance of managerial voluntarism for almost a half century, but the rise of neo-liberalism has revived managerial CSR, although once again it may not survive a global crisis. © The Author(s) 2013.","business ethics; corporate social responsibility; labour history; management history",

For the auction phase of the mechanism, we discuss incentive-compatible bidding strategies for suppliers, and how the buyer should determine the winning suppliers. In the follow-on bargaining phase, the buyer can implement a pricing strategy that views the winning suppliers as though they are in different groups. We develop a model and derive decision conditions for the buyer to formulate procurement strategy in this context. Our most important finding is that, compared with the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, the proposed mechanism improves the transactional social surplus, by including the possibility of post-auction bargaining.

This analysis of the liberal communist has at least two implications for research on CSR. First, it examines the ideological role of CSR by moving beyond a propaganda view, instead offering an ideological reading that focuses on the ways in which CSR seeks to obliterate any existing contradictions between 'philanthropic actions' on the one hand and 'profit-seeking business activities' on the other hand.

However, consumers often overstate their willingness to purchase environmentally conscious products, with global purchasing of these products relatively low. Much research has considered the role of drivers internal to an individual in making such consumption choices; however there is less knowledge as to how external influences may impact environmentally conscious consumption behaviour. As retailers increasingly strive to adopt and communicate their environmentally sustainable business practices, and encourage parallel consumer behavior, the question arises: what role do retailers play in influencing consumers' environmentally conscious consumption? In this paper we investigate this notion, specifically how external influences (the retailer and peers) impact environmentally conscious behavior. We investigate this behavior in terms of two outcomes; sustainable consumption (direct costs) and willingness to accept environmental taxes (indirect costs). Our research demonstrates that retailers can influence consumers to be more environmentally conscious in their consumption, with retailer influence a stronger mediator than peers in this relationship. One important implication of this research is that retailers have the opportunity to shape environmentally conscious consumption if they adopt sustainable business practices. © 2013.","Consumption; Environmental sustainability; Peer influence; Retailer influence","business; consumption behavior; retailing; sustainability; tax system"

The authors argue that a governance perspective offers a fruitful research strategy both to study empirically how firms balance the competing moral frameworks and political philosophies that are part and parcel of defining their role in society and to further the theoretical integration of the descriptive and normative perspectives in the business and society field. They illustrate the potential of this research strategy with a comparative case study of processes of responsiveness at four Dutch banks with markedly different governance structures. This study shows how governance systems and structures both enable and constrain corporate responsibility and responsiveness.

As well as integrating professional ethics into their curriculum, Business Schools are also developing standalone ethics courses, showing that they take seriously their responsibility to help prepare the next generation of managers to improve business' track record of transparency, accountability and sustainable development. However what are the learning approaches that will help to bring about real improvements in business ethics learning at university? This paper argues that a holistic approach to ethics teaching is needed, in which students are encouraged to develop ethical knowledge and skills within their personal value systems. In this way ethics does not become something apart but integrated into one's terms of reference. The paper discusses a particular pedagogic approach designed to develop a student's 'critical consciousness' using a student-led learning method in which students actively engage with important concepts and discuss the issues amongst themselves within an environment where they can speak freely. Qualitative interviews with a selection of undergraduates on the compulsory first year professional ethics module provide insight into the impact of the method on attitudes and behaviours. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, very few works examine tourism destinations from a network perspective. Networks can be analyzed from either a relationship or a structural perspective. The aim of the present article is to adopt both of these perspectives to assess the different relationships that exist between tourism stakeholders (both private and public) within a specific Italian 3S tourism destination: Costa Smeralda-Gallura in the North-East of the island of Sardinia. Data were gathered from destination management organization (DMO) internal documents, local press, and through a questionnaire completed by a number of tourism organizations chosen from a list provided by the DMO, which at the time was the public body instructed to keep the official register. Our findings describe the Gallura-based destination as a network specifically defined by a relatively low level of density, collaboration, and integration in the relationships between local stakeholders. The study suggests that destination marketers and policy makers should run internal marketing and branding operations in order to enhance their collaboration, and therefore reach a strategic consensus among stakeholders. © 2013 Cognizant Comm.

Second, relative to other reputation drivers, to what extent does corporate responsibility predict corporate reputation for the countries in our dataset? Third, to what extent does corporate responsibility predict stakeholder intent in these countries to engage in supportive behavior toward the firm? Finally, are stakeholder perceptions of and responses to corporate responsibility sufficiently similar across Norway, Sweden, and Denmark to justify claims for a monolithic ""Scandinavian approach"" to CSR?

Yet, despite the synergy between tourism and neo-liberal politics, tourism brings up issues that weaken that politics. The paper focuses on four aspects of society-consumerism, democracy, the work ethos and urban class politics-arguing that the relationship between this politics and tourism is contradictory in each of these areas.

Using Lievrouw's (2001) information environments (IE) theory, this mixed methods study compares three regional HIV/AIDS information environments in rural Canada. In accordance with IE theory, findings showed regional variation in institutional aspects of HIV/AIDS information environments: health institution service models; resource munificence and technology use; and some measures of social engagement and source availability. Differences were also present in the personal/relational aspects of environments: information network characteristics and levels of interpersonal interaction. However, in divergence from IE theory, regional success rates for answering HIV/AIDS-related questions were similar (86.26-89.34 percent). Furthermore, individual-level factors were more important than network position in predicting participants' success rates. Yet, in line with IE theory, there were regional differences in the barriers that people affected by HIV/AIDS faced when seeking answers to their questions.

Those steps are constantly repeated in a never-ending circle, where each iteration provides deeper understanding of people's current circumstances and background for active participation in the society. The model reflects the fact that the role of academic community in the network society is directly associated with the question what kind of world we would like to live in.

The criteria are based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. Using the 3-year period from 2002 to 2005, we find that firm valuation is positive and significantly associated with CSP.

The latter issue has been largely ignored in extant empirical research regarding cross-cultural ethical profiles. In this study, we employ a design that allows for a more complete analysis of cross-cultural perspectives, examining both the manner in which selected cultures view themselves and the manner in which those same cultures perceive the ethical profiles of others. To this end, we surveyed master's students in business fields at several universities in the United States and China-two countries/cultures that engage in a significant amount of business transactions-and examined differences in personal ethical profiles across cultures, differences in one group's ethical profile and the way it is perceived by the other group, and differences in perceived ethical profiles across cultures; that is, differences in how groups view each other.

Second, is the CSR orientation of banks focused on areas which are driven by nature of its target markets, such that there is an alignment between CSR orientation and benefits accrued to its stakeholder segments, directly or indirectly? Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze 49 Indian banks (25 public sector, 15 private sector and nine foreign banks) operating in India based on data available from the banks' web sites, annual reports and sustainability/CSR reports (if available). From content analysis, the data were into seven categories - Education, Health, Community Welfare, Entrepreneurship Development, Environment, Market Place, and Rural Development. Findings: The results indicate that CSR orientation of Indian Banks differ only based on ownership, number of employees, and date of its incorporation in the areas of Environment & Rural development (for ownership), Community Welfare, Environment, and Rural development (for number of employees), and Environment, and market place (for date of its incorporation). Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study should be confirmed in future studies since this study is based on qualitative analysis of information shared by banks on their CSR activities and programs. Practical implications: Bank managers need to identify and focus on areas in which CSR orientation can give them more strategic advantage in building relationship with its stakeholders. Doing so would help in meeting the expectations of the stakeholder expectations successfully. Originality/value: This paper contributes to literature in many ways.

In order to compare these high-level integration discourses against patterns at the level of resource allocation, we analyze nearly 2500 research solicitations from the three European Framework Programmes for R&D during the period 1998-2010. We identify four distinct types of integration (socio-ethical, stakeholder, socio-economic and industrial) that occur either as core or parallel components of R&D solicitations. Quantitative analysis reveals an overall trend towards increasing integration, with requests integrating industrial and socio-economic aspects substantially outnumbering those integrating socio-ethical and stakeholder aspects - by a 2 to 1 margin. Meanwhile, calls for socio-technical integration have become slightly more extensive (ranging across a broader range of research areas addressed), significantly more pervasive (shifting from the periphery to the core of R&D practices), and arguably less diverse (involving a wider variety of integration types) over time. The relative lack of attention to socio-ethical aspects and stakeholder participation in European research is particularly notable given that we focus on potentially controversial areas (life sciences, energy, and nanotechnology), which likely overemphasizes the prevalence of integration throughout the Framework Programmes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In 2004, a U.S. District Court entered an order granting class certification, potentially extending the retailer's financial liability to thousands of current and past Wal-Mart employees. At that time, the Wal-Mart suit was the largest class action lawsuit ever approved in the United States. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the lower court's ruling.

The purpose of this article is to illustrate that Cicero-lawyer, politician, orator and prolific writer, and one of the earliest experts in the field recognised the significance of moral behaviour in his society. Cicero wrote 'Moral Duties' (De Officiis) about 44 BC. He addressed the four cardinal virtues wisdom, justice, courage and temperance, illustrating how practical wisdom, theoretical/conceptual wisdom and justice were viewed in Rome of the first century BC. 'Moral Duties' is a letter admonishing his son, Marcus. It refers to personal behaviour, business practice and analyses terms such as good faith and criminal fraud. In addition, it contains material which would be suitable for tutorials/seminars and discussions, particularly in the areas of critical thinking in business ethics and general management. A study of De Officiis in respect to present day management and business practice could give a wider perspective to business ethics and management students. If concepts such as moral virtue, moral propriety and moral goodness, many of which seem to be ignored in business situations today, are to be embedded in business leaders of the future, it is reasonable to expect that these qualities will be analysed and discussed by business students today. Further, a study of Cicero's six-step approach, when preparing an address/speech, could be useful and productive for practitioners and students in this area. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business practice; Cardinal virtues; First century BC Rome; Philosophy of morals; Prudent behaviour",

In this paper, using Bayesian causal maps (BCMs) methodology, relationships between legal and political environments of business and EBOF are investigated. The unique design of our study allows us to analyze these relationships based on the stages of development in 92 countries around the world. The EBOF models structured through BCMs are used to explain how EBOF in a given country group are shaped by how managers perceive political, legislative, and protective environments of business in these countries. The results suggest that irregular payments and bribes are the most influential factors affecting managers' perceptions of business ethics in relatively more advanced economies, whereas intellectual property protection is the most influential factor affecting managers' perceptions of business ethics in less-advanced economies. The results also suggest that regardless of where the business is conducted in the world, judicial independence is the driving force behind managers' perceptions of business ethics. In addition, the results of this study provide further support for scholars who argue that business ethics is likely to vary among countries based on their socio-economic factors. In addition to its managerial implications, the study provides directions for policy makers to improve the ethical conduct of businesses in their respective countries. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bayesian causal map; Bribery; Country development stage; Ethical behavior of firms; Intellectual property protection; Judicial independence",

The lack of or ineffective stakeholder participation is a major obstacle to ST realisation and there is little clarity as to how best to resolve this problem. This paper presents the findings of a purposive UK-based case study that evaluated stakeholder involvement in the implementation of ST. Using over fifty stakeholders' accounts drawn from eight primary stakeholder groups, a 'multi-stakeholder involvement management' (MSIM) framework was developed. The MSIM framework consists of three strategic levels: attraction, integration and management of stakeholder involvement. Six stages are embedded within the three levels: scene-setting, recognition of stakeholder involvement capacity, stakeholder relationship management, pursuit of achievable objectives, influencing implementation capacity and monitoring stakeholder involvement. These are supported by the overarching notion of 'hand-holding' and key actions [. e.g. managing stakeholder adaptability] that enhance stakeholder involvement in ST. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Implementation; Stakeholder framework; Stakeholder involvement; Sustainable tourism","ecotourism; participatory approach; stakeholder; tourism management; United Kingdom"

There is a continuum of perceptions regarding sex trafficking and the event: the Games can be a catalyst for trafficking; it is an uncertain risk; and, the Games are not a potential catalyst for trafficking. In terms of specific preventative measures, it is suggested that strategic planning lacked a centralised approach and there was a gap in the provision of awareness campaigns.

Many prior studies have looked at CSD practice from the managerial perspective, while providing less of an insight into non-managerial stakeholder perspectives. Several researchers have argued that the social and environmental accounting literature needs to incorporate the voice of non-managerial stakeholders in CSD development. This paper contributes to the stakeholder-perception-based CSD literature. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in selected social and environmental NGOs of both overseas and Bangladeshi origin. The results suggest that NGO executives are sceptical of current CSD practice. To them, current CSD is ad hoc and no more than a public relations exercise, lacking credibility. Most importantly, owing to structural constraints NGO executives assign lesser significance to CSD than to direct corporate involvement in social development. They described structural constraints as: high levels of poverty, weak governmental structures, dependence on foreign aid and a small group of local business people, lack of awareness of CSD, and an underdeveloped stakeholder relationship. All of these constraints are embedded within the socio-cultural and political history of Bangladesh. NGO executives believe strongly in action rather than words. They suggest that corporations need to engage in social development and to improve their social performance in order to meet their social and environmental responsibilities to the Bangladeshi people. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bangladesh; Corporate social disclosure; Non-Governmental organisations",

We propose that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between firms' CSR and their inventory levels. Two elements explain such a proposal. First, stakeholders have different interests regarding the outcome of the inventory system. Specifically, we hypothesize that customers put pressure on firms to increase inventories; employees have conflicting views regarding inventories, and for this reason they do not put pressure on firms in a particular direction; and environmental activists force firms to reduce inventories. The second element to explain the previous relationship is that there is a different level of stakeholder proactiveness contingent on the intensity in the implementation of social responsible policies. While employee demands are a priority for every firm, we posit that there is variation in the relative importance attached to customers and the natural environment: for low levels of CSR, customers are more relevant; and for higher levels of CSR, the natural environment gains importance. We test this theoretical prediction using a database that contains financial information from COMPUSTAT and CSR data from the KLD database. Our final sample includes 1881 US companies (9269 observations) for the period 1996-2006. Results provide support to our theoretical contentions. Our findings will be helpful to strategic and tactical decision-making processes on inventory management and will allow researchers to offer concrete advice on the likely outcomes of various stakeholder relationship practices in order to improve the effectiveness of inventory systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is used as a pivotal cultural document establishing ""toxic discourse"" as an ongoing form of moral narrative rooted in the rationality of counterpublics. Toxic discourse is framed within a center/periphery model in which toxic discourse gains salience in periods of economic dislocation and uncertainty. In these periods, toxic discourse draws together those on the periphery or counterpublics who otherwise would not unite in their opposition to the center. The article critically examines how stakeholder theory, despite making sense of the public sphere for agents of organizations, glosses counterpublics and relegates toxic discourse, as evident in the ""Occupy Movement,"" to the ephemeral role of temporary, disruptive protest groups with very little of substance to communicate. © 2013 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

An examination of the history of the American case, crucial for the development of the modern corporation as well as the ""explicit"" form of CSR that eventually followed it, highlights these roles: the willingness of the state to intervene with force in labor conflicts bolstered the managerial autonomy that defined the large corporation, and the way government expenditures promoted innovation and firm success.

In doing so, we tested two competing hypotheses. First, we tested for the positive spillover of community diversity climate on employees' intent to stay in their organization. Second, we tested for the compensation hypothesis, whereby community diversity climate moderated the organizational diversity climate-employee intent to stay relationship, with the above relationship being stronger for individuals hailing from communities with poor diversity climates. In addition, we also posited a three-way interaction model of community diversity climate, organizational diversity climate, and employee racial affiliations with the interaction between organizational and community diversity climates on intent to stay being stronger for the minority employees.

Drawing from social exchange theory, the purpose of this paper is to propose that the performance-turnover intentions association may be contingent upon individuals' exchange relationships with their supervisor and co-workers. Design/methodology/approach: Surveys were conducted in six branches of an elderly care organization. All 512 employees received a questionnaire, and responses were obtained from 225 employees. Findings: Self-rated performance and manager-rated performance were both negatively related to turnover intentions. The relationship between manager-rated performance and turnover intentions was stronger under conditions of high leader-member exchange, whereas the relationship between self-rated performance and turnover intentions was weaker under conditions of high task interdependence. Research limitations/implications: High performers may be particularly sensitive to relationships with their supervisor, and low performers seem to be more sensitive to relationships with colleagues. Performance data obtained from different sources (self/manager ratings) may show different patterns of results. The value of these findings in extending notions from social exchange theory to the realm of talent engagement is discussed. Practical implications: To retain high performers, firms should promote high-quality relationships between leaders and subordinates. Social implications: The study suggests that investing in social relationships in the health care sector may be worthwhile. In particular, women represent an increasingly important share in this sector, and social mechanisms may help retain high-performing women. Originality/value: The study addresses the inconsistent findings of prior research regarding the performance-turnover relationship, and the lack of agreement on variables that may relate to the retention of valuable employees. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Elder care; Health care; Leader-member exchange; Performance; Task interdependence; Turnover intentions",

Although social exchange theorists have directed their attention to the universality of the norms of reciprocation and have indicated the prevalence of an instrumental view of reciprocity, we elaborate on the cross-cultural variations that exist regarding the way individuals view and apply the principle of reciprocation in the countries which we examine. To understand these variations, we discuss the pivotal cultural/historical conditions that seem to shape social exchanges and therefore country differences in favors exchanges. For example, while social relationships and the collective play a preponderant role in these three countries, the exchange of favors in China and India is primarily based on hierarchically-defined and ascriptive ties compared to Japan where relationships' formation go beyond ethnicity, kinship, and family-oriented ties and are likely to be defined by the group membership. Finally, we end our discussion of favors by highlighting the bright and dark sides focusing on their use in the organizational milieu.

The study found an overall average level of sustainability consideration in the actual situation of 25.9%. For the desired situation, this score is almost 10 percent higher, showing an ambition to take sustainability more into consideration. The study also showed that the way sustainability currently is considered in projects should be categorized as the traditional ""making things less bad"" approach to sustainability integration and not as a more modern ""how can we contribute to making things good"" approach.

The framework draws on a literature review of concepts, definitions, and theories in strategic management, corporate sustainability, and projects. The conceptual framework presented in this book chapter has six key components. These are: (1) corporate sustainability strategy; (2) project understanding of SD and SD business case; (3) strategizing at project initiation stage; (4) project autonomy to negotiate and adapt in the project context; (5) project capability to translate corporate SD strategy to project SD strategy; and (6) project capability in stakeholder management. The premise of the framework is the compatibility of the socially constructed realities of the project and SD, as indicated in SD and project literature.

Success of such planning efforts depends on consensus and support among the key stakeholders and also the general public. This research investigates the impact of stakeholder attitudes and perception on rail infrastructure planning efforts in Missouri, a Midwestern state in the USA. It is important that stakeholders with an interest in community economic development play an active role in the development of the rail network. Ample opportunity must be provided for meaningful input, and stakeholders must be aware that their issues have been heard and understood. Data collected through surveys, interviews, focus group discussions, and public meetings conducted across the state are used to develop a stakeholder engagement process. The social factors and uncertainties that affect planning for a sustainable rail network are identified and validated using qualitative and quantitative methods.

Training on the subject can be dull and can fail to engage staff in the issues, but using scenarios helps to convey ethical messages and gives staff the tools to identify and deal with ethical dilemmas. The purpose of this paper is to summarise the case for business ethics training and the role of scenarios. It seeks to suggest ways to develop effective scenarios and to describe a case study of how one company incorporated them into its training. Design/methodology/approach: This article is based on the Institute of Business Ethics' experience of developing scenarios for its subscriber organisations. Findings: The paper shows that scenarios give employees practice at applying ethical frameworks and company standards to workplace situations. Scenario training is an opportunity for a ""dry run"" so that employees will know what to do when confronted with a real situation.

Any multinational business, whether its home offices are in the USA or the EU, or in Tokyo, Manila or Shanghai, is likely to have struggled over questions of setting policy on many such issues, ranging from the employment of women and children, to appropriate occupational safety standards, to the regulation of gift-giving and receiving, to questionable payments and business entertainments, as well as to sexual discrimination and harassment. While such topics routinely appear in business ethics case studies, the problem in teaching them in Asian settings-college classrooms, university seminars, and in-house training programs-is that the cases tend to reflect the cultural values shared by their authors and the people in the situations they describe and analyze. Case studies imported from Western sources therefore not surprisingly also carry with them Western assumptions about common morality, standard business practices, legal institutions and their effectiveness, as well as the social and political environment in which businesses operate. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

While the more traditional ""hard"" technical skills of project managers have drawn much attention, little light has been shed on the ""soft"" skills, especially social competencies in the construction context. This study has adopted a well-established competency model from human resource management theories as a basis for the theoretical framework to examine the social competencies of construction project managers. This led to the development of a model via the use of a structural equation modelling approach. Four dimensions of social competencies for construction project managers were identified, i.e. working with others, stakeholder management, leading others, and social awareness. Attention to these attributes will help construction project managers to develop their social competencies, and could contribute towards a better performance in their workplace which will in turn improve the performance of the whole organisation. Implications of adopting this approach were also discussed. © 2012.","Construction project managers; Construction projects; Social competencies; Structural models","Construction project managers; Construction projects; Identification and evaluation; Social competencies; Stakeholder management; Structural equation modelling; Structural models; Theoretical framework; Human resource management; Managers; Model structures; Project management; construction; human resource; numerical model; performance assessment; project management; resource management; stakeholder; theoretical study; China"

They are typically embedded in local communities and therefore well placed to influence community wellbeing. While there has been considerable theoretical and empirical analysis of corporate citizenship and corporate social responsibility (CSR), the nature of micro-business community responsibility (mBCR) remains relatively under-explored. This article presents findings from an exploratory study of mBCR that examined the approaches, motivations and barriers of this phenomenon. Analysis of data from 36 semi-structured interviews with micro-business owner-operators in the Australian city of Brisbane revealed three mBCR approaches, suggesting an observable mBCR typology. Each mBCR type was at least partly driven by enlightened self-interest (ESI). In addition to a pure ESI approach, findings revealed ESI combined with philanthropic approaches and ESI combined with social entrepreneurial approaches. The combination of doing business and doing good found amongst participants in this study suggests that many micro-business owner-operators are supporters of their local communities and, therefore, driven by more than profit.

One side says, immoral decisions stem from mistakes about its content and its scope (Price, 19). In other words, ethical failure is a function of cognition; it stems from the agent's lack of understanding of the ethical dilemma, stakeholders, available options, and their consequences. The other side believes that unethical decisions happen because agents prioritize their self-interests above anything else, most especially above those of the group for which they are responsible. They have no difficulty distinguishing the good from the bad choices and, yet, willingly choose the latter. In other words, ethical misdeed is volitional. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Data were collected from 203 green innovation project leaders from electronics manufacturers operating in China. The results indicate that knowledge sharing mediates the relationship between green requirements and new green product success as well as that between green requirements and green product and process innovations. Interestingly, the empirical analysis rejects the hypothesized positive influence of green requirements on green product and process innovations as well as that on new green product success, while confirming that there exists a direct and positive association between green requirements and knowledge sharing. The direct positive impact of knowledge sharing is the strongest on green process innovation. This study provides a theoretical basis for investigating the possible determinants in the causal links between green requirements and green innovation success and establishes that knowledge sharing and green process innovation may be the points where leverage can be applied to best secure innovation success.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a survey of 95 consumers in each country to investigate attitudes to CSR platforms and CSR initiatives and responses to CSR-based marketing strategies (in terms of attitude to the company and purchasing intent). Findings: The study found similar attitudes across nationalities to both CSR platforms and CSR initiatives, with greater importance assigned to CSR reflecting legal and ethical (rather than philanthropic) concerns. (Some) CSR-based marketing strategies, reflecting an ethical (people/planet) concern, led to significantly more positive attitudes to the company and higher purchasing intent.

Through corporate social reporting, the social and environmental effects of companies' economic actions are communicated to interest groups. However, the information contained in financial and social reports tends to be presented quite separately from that in the others, and this may lead to confusion among users. Therefore, several major companies have introduced an integrated reporting system, which coherently summarizes the information available, thus making stakeholders participants in business management. Corporate governance mechanisms such as the Board of Directors play an important role in good practices of corporate social responsibility, implementing policies of stakeholder engagement, including processes to achieve holistic transparency. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the influence played by certain features of the Board of Directors in the degree of information integration presented by leading non-financial multinational firms. Specifically, we examined 568 companies from 15 countries, for the period 2008-2010. The results obtained show that growth opportunities, the size of a company and its management bodies, together with gender diversity, are the most important factors in the integrated dissemination of information.

Whereas traditional public relations theory teaches us that an organization should synchronize its messages across channels, there are no models to understand how an organization may strategically coordinate public relations messaging across traditional and social media platforms. This is especially important in the new media environment where social media (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) are increasingly being used in concert with traditional public relations tools (e.g. press releases) as a part of an organization's stakeholder engagement strategy. This paper seeks to address these issues.

They are closely linked to urban growth and underpin the economic, social and environmental performance of modern cities. At the same time places shape the transformation of such complex infrastructural systems. Effective waste management contributes significantly to public health, environmental sustainability and economic development and it is an inherently urban challenge. Combining insights from urban studies with research on 'systems innovation' and 'sustainable transitions', this paper deals with a transformation towards a more sustainable waste management system in an urban setting. More specifically, the paper describes how Greater Manchester (UK) underwent a transformation from a relatively simple landfill model to a highly complex, multi-technology waste solution based on intensive recycling and composting, and sustainable energy usage. The case is relevant because the UK has long been seen as a laggard when it comes to sustainable waste practices. The 1999 EU landfill directive exerted great pressure to change waste practices in the UK. Against the national trend of incineration with energy recovery, Greater Manchester opted instead for a solution that was deemed more innovative and sustainable, but which involved overcoming significant technological, political and financial challenges. The paper investigates the process that led to this purposive transformation, characterized by a mix of political vision, stakeholder engagement, economies of scale, and the ability of waste disposal managers to gather expertise, resources, political influence and commitment at multiple levels of governance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the differences between what is ethically appropriate and what is not in an international context has thus become important for a better understanding of different negotiation practices across the globe. This study explores the likelihood of Chinese negotiators' using unethical strategies in negotiations by examining Chinese managerial employees' perceived appropriateness of five categories of ethically questionable strategies. The results show that, in comparison with their counterparts from the USA, Chinese managers are more likely to consider it appropriate to use ethically questionable negotiation strategies in all five categories except the traditional bargaining strategies. In addition, contrary to the West where women tend to maintain higher ethical standards, no gender difference is found in China in the perceived appropriateness of using these strategies in all but one category. Implications for negotiation practitioners and international managers that often participate in international negotiations with the Chinese are then discussed, along with potential future research directions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Business ethics; China; Culture; Negotiation strategy; SINS; USA",

Design/methodology/approach: The web sites of the 200 companies were surfed and the relevant documents of the codes of ethics were extracted to separate text files. The computer files were then mined using the customized developed software and each ethical keyword was counted. The number of filed codes of ethics was 95 for both the 100 US-based and the 100 Global-based companies. Findings: In addition to the content analysis of the ethic codes of the studied groups and finding high-frequency ethical keywords, the results of this study indicate a convergence of the contents. Moreover, the results also show that the ethical codes are now more readily available on corporations' web sites; that is a sign of higher level of disclosure of ethical codes compared to that in 2006. Finally, this research proposes some hypotheses to explain the changes from 2006 to 2009. Practical implications: Many smaller corporations and start-up companies can benefit from the results of this study by comparing their codes of ethics with those of the major US and global companies, using key ethical phrases that are discussed here. Moreover, US companies wanting to establish new subsidiaries in other countries can also take advantage of the results of this study. They can find out what are the common dissimilarities between American corporates and other international firms, from ethical point of view, when they want to reach a uniform code of ethics. Social implications: Longitudinal study of the content of codes of ethics can help in encouraging firms to give consideration to ethical issues. This research is the first attempt to study the ethical standards adopted by the major US and global corporations, before and after the global financial crisis. Originality/value: This study analyses the content of codes of ethics of the world's top firms and compares Fortune 500 and global 500 companies, considering the frequency of ethical keywords on their codes. It also compares the similarities and differences and indicates whether the content is divergent or convergent. The study also shows how the disclosure of codes of ethics has changed in the time-span of research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Codes of ethics; Corporate ethics; Corporate governance; Ethical standards; Fortune 100; Global 100; Web sites",

Beginning with a summary of the Protestant Work Ethic, as outlined in Weber's thesis of 1904-06, a review of key debates around it is given, followed by details of some recent works which demonstrate its continuing relevance for historical scholars as well as the shortcomings of some recent studies which have sought to test it in detail. A brief outline of the business progress of Cowan's papermaking business then follows, after which key aspects of Weber's thesis are tested against the firm's experience. The study concludes that Weber's thesis adequately describes the motivation and progress of the firm and its owners, providing detailed empirical evidence which supports the Weber thesis and justifies further detailed studies. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","calling; family business; predestination; Protestant Work Ethic","business; ethics; family structure; historical perspective; industrial enterprise"

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs survey methodology to reveal the extent to which various social commonalities between customers and service providers encourage customers to believe that they are entitled to financial discounts. Findings: The findings show that commonalities may cause customers to adhere to narcissism - that is, many customers may expect discounts even when they know that employees may jeopardize their jobs by providing them. Research limitations/implications: Customer relationships dramatically change with commonalities, as customers believe that social relationships propel them to ""best customer status"" and that they are entitled to discounts. Practical implications: Customers who become increasingly connected with employees expect relational benefits that usually require time to develop. Retailers that encourage their employees to develop social media bonds with their customers must realize that customers desire to be financially rewarded for maintaining these linkages.

Prior research highlights the positive consequences of CCI but does not study the process by which CCI shapes both positive and negative consumer reactions to new company initiatives. This study aims to elaborate this process by modelling the mediating consequences of CCI (commitment to the company and feeling of belonging to an in-group) on consumers' responses to brand extensions. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 291 respondents, spanning two companies and four brand extension scenarios. The model parameters were estimated through partial least squares path modelling. Findings: CCI leads to commitment to the company and to a related group, through identification processes. Both forms of commitment influence consumer reactions to new corporate initiatives. The effect of company commitment is stable; in-group commitment is more influential in forming consumer responses but varies depending on the severity of the situation. Originality/value: This research elaborates the mechanisms of identity-based commitment and its effect on consumer responses to new company initiatives. The two-tiered, identification-based commitment model highlights how identified customers relate to both the company and in-groups of consumers, as a result of CCI.

They generate information for online communities by sharing their knowledge, information and experience, and thus support organisational learning. Co-creation of value with consumers instead of co-creation of value for consumers is a new strategy for organisational development. The purpose of this paper is to investigate social factors introduced through social media to sport organisations in the co-creation of value with fans. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts social capital and social support theory and investigates the way sport organisations can apply social relationship with fans in online communities in order to co-create value for organisational development. The study looks at the current literature and the potential theoretical development for organisational learning. Findings: Social interaction of individuals through social media and online communities has introduced co-creation of value with customers. This behaviour originates from the supportive climate that has emerged through Web 2.0, where individuals share their information, knowledge, and experience through online communities. This co-creation offers online social support as a source of social capital for organisations. The results can be beneficial for the development of sport organisations in the co-creation of value with fans. Research limitations/implications: The clear implication of the research would be whether sport organisations can develop virtual communities and offer rich means that facilitate individuals' interactions. The research highlights the theoretical foundation and opportunities for sport organisational development. However, the study does not provide an empirical test of the theory. Therefore, an empirical test of the research theory is a future research direction. Originality/value: This research investigates social factors introduced through social media to sport organisations in the co-creation of value with fans. The contribution of the research is to provide the theoretical bases for a new research area for sport organisational development through social media. Sport organisations can learn from the social interactions of their fans and develop their strategies.

One such measure has been the introduction of flexible working policies. While academic and policy debates focus on the barriers to flexible working, less consideration is paid to those who work alongside flexible workers. Through a gendered lens, this article focuses on professional women and explores the implications of UK flexible working policies for women's workplace relations in organizations that have traditionally been based on male models of working. Drawing on interviews conducted in three English organizations, it was found that the women's interests did not always coincide and that their social relationships, with respect to flexible working, involved both support and resentment. In particular, the women's interests were affected by organizational and job-related factors and their stage in the life course. These findings illuminate the ways in which policies are negotiated at the level of daily workplace life and show that co-workers are a pivotal part of the wider picture of flexible working. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Co-worker relations; Flexible working policies; Gendered work organizations; Resentment; Support","gender relations; labor policy; womens employment; womens organization; working conditions; workplace; United Kingdom"

However, on reviewing previous research, we argue that several fundamental questions remain unclear and need further investigation. (1) Ethical leaders are defined as behaving 'normatively appropriate[ly]' (Brown et al., Organ Behav Hum Decis Process 97(2):117-134, 2005), but it remains unclear what this entails. What specific behaviours does an ethical leader show? (2) To date, ethical leadership has focused primarily on leader behaviour towards employees. Which stakeholders apart from employees are important to the ethical leader, and what kind of ethical behaviour does the ethical leader show towards them? (3) What are further antecedents and consequences of ethical leadership? We addressed these questions by qualitatively analysing interviews with 17, mostly Swiss, executive ethical leaders. The results indicate that executive ethical leaders care not only about employees but also about other stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, owners of companies, the natural environment and society. Additionally, this study identified a broad range of executive ethical leaders' behaviours towards these stakeholders, and, therefore, may function as a useful resource for future quantitative studies. Furthermore, we identified several antecedents of executive ethical leadership, for example ethical role models, business strategy and owner's values, and consequences such as effects on other stakeholders than employees. Finally, our results shed more light on the processes of ethical guidance of employees.

In addition, they seek to investigate how a firm's strategy moderates the associations between their outsourcing and subcontracting-in activities and radical innovativeness. Design/methodology/ approach - The authors utilized regression analytical technique and categorical moderation analytical technique to test their hypotheses on survey data of 579 firms. Findings - Results show that outsourcing has a positive association with radical innovativeness. In contrast, subcontracting-in shows a negative association with radical innovativeness. Finally, the influence of both outsourcing and subcontracting-in activities on radical innovativeness are contingent upon a firm's manufacturing strategy.

Another and less obvious casualty is the car rental industry. Macro factors, such as declines in corporate and leisure spending on travel, and industry-specific issues, such as poor fleet management, depressed prices in the used car market, and restricted new car allocations from auto manufacturers, have dealt car rental companies crippling blows. However, survival depends on the fittest---or in this case, the leanest. Like a phoenix emerging from the ashes, car rental companies reported record revenues in 2011. This paper will analyze from a financial perspective the leaner business model developed by the leasing and rental industry. Financial ratios for efficiency, profitability, solvency, and growth will be compared before and after implementation of the leaner business paradigm. Inferences drawn from this analytical review of the industry will focus on cost efficiencies, optimal fleet management, sustainable construction, political costs, and measuring the costs/benefits of going green.

This study aims to examine construction practitioners' collective cognition of value to determine how their facilitation may bias this intent. A value continuum is contributed. Design/methodology/approach - Critique of the design quality indicator (the primary value agenda instrument) finds that it overemphasises objective value, confirming the need for practitioners to help stakeholders develop broader understanding of value. The freelisting technique of cultural anthropology is adopted to model practitioners' collective cognition of value and, thus, their bias over this process. The standard freelisting protocol is followed. Findings - Practitioners' collective understanding is found to comprise related concepts that resolve to a one dimensional 'value continuum' with subjective and objective terminals and which fully embodies value agenda intent. In contrast, the concepts articulated by the design quality indicator are biased towards the objective value continuum terminal, confirming the need for practitioners to facilitate stakeholder exploration of the full continuum if the value agenda is to be fully addressed. Research limitations/implications - The value continuum only reflects the views of a small but typical sample of construction practitioners. Further work must characterise model completeness and consistency through the supply chain.

We provide a theoretical explanation of why this will be the case using examples to illustrate. Subsequently, we set out an alternative theoretical framework for the purposes of investigating whether markets place a positive, or a negative, valuation on CSP, and show why this is superior to tests based upon Tobin's Q. Using US KLD data, we demonstrate that, as theorised, markets place a positive value on CSP that is not detected by conventional returns-based tests. Our conclusion is that researchers who are interested in the question of whether engagement with a corporate social responsibility agenda is a value-enhancing activity for a company (as argued by some stakeholder theorists) or value destructive (as argued by Friedman, The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits, The New York Times Magazine, 1970), need to look beyond returns-based tests to answer the research question posed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social performance; Valuation methods",

This empirical study of 197 project portfolios investigates the effect of the intensity of engagement (IoE) of portfolio-internal stakeholders on project portfolio success. We show that the effect of stakeholders is phase-specific and that role clarity as a measure of PPM maturity affects the nature of the relationship between the IoE of stakeholders and portfolio success. The effects of the IoE of senior managers on success are not clearly positive with regard to strategic portfolio structuring and are even negative in operative portfolio steering in established PPM systems. In immature PPM systems, line managers tend to take advantage of their position in resource management. Surprisingly, the influence of portfolio managers in portfolio steering is insignificant. Altogether, this paper shows the diverse effect of the IoE of stakeholders on portfolio success.

However, few if any business schools have any systematic or critical human rights content in their accounting and business curricula. This oversight is increasingly problematic as concern grows over the burgeoning size and power of multinational corporations in relation to nation states, cases where large multinational corporations have been complicit in human rights violations, and increasing corporate roles in the provision of state services. This shift of human rights duties, responsibilities and accountability from nation states to corporations has resulted in a number of new United Nations initiatives, voluntary standards and international protocols to bring the UNDHR to bear on business activity. This paper explores how the universal human rights apparatus and discourse is impacting corporations' responsibilities for the protection and promotion of human rights and sustainable development. The emerging business and human rights discourse presents a number of challenges to the dominant ideology taught in business schools and is likely to be resisted. This paper presents a moral and pragmatic case for incorporating human rights into business and accounting education at tertiary and professional levels.

A third dimension that is critical for the hospitality industry is behavior above and beyond the specific job description that is directed at customers. While most OCB studies have considered what behaviors are essential to corporate citizenship, but specific behaviors might be culturally bound. To avoid cultural issues, a more effective approach is to analyze the targets of citizenship behavior, that is, the organization, coworkers, and customers. A study of 240 hotel workers in China found support for a three-leg model of OCB, combining behavior aimed at these targets: at the organization itself, at coworkers, and at customers. Citizenship behavior aimed at the organization includes such activities as promoting a hotel's products and making favorable comments about the property outside of work. Citizenship behavior in support of coworkers includes assisting them as needed and taking time to listen to coworkers' concerns. Customer-focused OCB includes such activities as maintaining a positive attitude at work and performing duties carefully and accurately. Although this study did not expressly measure the results of such actions, previous work has shown increases in guest satisfaction and company revenue when OCB activities are high. © The Author(s) 2013.","customer service; hospitality; hotel management; organizational citizenship behavior",

Instead, the potentially extraordinary effectiveness and the potential danger of pharmaceuticals must be the object of social management. 'Management' here in the first place refers to the societal level instead of an organizational level, although regulation of professional roles (the pharmacist) and organizations (pharmaceutical industry) comes in on a second level. Drawing on an approach from conceptual history, the argument is that pharmaceuticals must be coherently embedded in both semantic and social structures to appear as legitimate medical means instead of dangerous poisons. In the course of this sociologically induced historical analysis, the article shows that organizations cannot easily replace professional role structures, but that this replacement depends on both semantic and social structural innovations - and that it incurs new challenges. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","discursive history; governance; management; organization; pharmaceutical; regulation; second order systems theory; semantic analysis",

First, I delineate two fundamental criteria that I believe must be met for any such approach to be viable: viz., the virtues must be exercised for the sake of the good of one's life as a unitary whole (contra role-morality approaches) and for the common good of the communities of which one is a part as well as the individual good of their members (contra egoist approaches). Second, I argue that these two criteria can be met only if we are able to reconceive and transform the nature of work within contemporary business organizations. In particular, what is needed, I argue, is a retrieval of something like the older ideal of work as a ""vocation"", or ""calling"", whereby work can be viewed as a specific aspect of a more general calling to pursue, through the practice of the virtues, ""the good life"" both for ourselves and for others. Lastly, I consider some important challenges to this ""vocational virtue ethic"" approach to work within contemporary business organizations and offer a few suggestions for how they might be met. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aristotle; Bellah, Robert; Business Ethics; Calling; MacIntyre, Alasdair; Virtue Ethics; Vocation",

Many of these jobs are entry-level or frontline employee positions in retail or service industries, which can be ripe opportunities for ethical misconduct. However, most research on ethics and employees has focused on upper-level managers and CEOs. Although insightful, ethics scholars contend that there are more low-level employees who face ethical dilemmas on a daily basis. Given the increase of working students and the paucity of research on entry-level job ethics, this study investigates, categorizes, and analyzes ethical dilemmas faced by college students who work while attending school. This article considers ethical decision-making models and corporate ethical values as its conceptual base. A qualitative approach for this study was taken due to the scarcity of research on ethical issues faced by entry-level employees and the call by ethics researchers for qualitative research to explore the complex and psychosocially embedded nature of business ethics.

Sustainability concerns are concurrently becoming significant to business planning around corporate social responsibility and integral to organizational strategies toward enhancing shareholder value. The mindset of corporate managers is a key factor in determining company approaches to sustainability. But what do corporate managers understand by sustainability? Our study explores discursive meaning negotiation surrounding the concepts of environment and sustainability within business discourse. The study is based on qualitative interpretive research drawing from symbolic interactionism (Blumer, Symbolic interactionism: perspective and method. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1969) which postulates that meaning in discourse is an essentially contested domain dependent upon negotiation in the Habermasian tradition of mutually respectful dialogue (Habermas, The theory of communicative action: lifeworld and system: a critique of functionalist reason. Beacon Press, Boston 1987). Data from semi-structured intensive interviews of a small sample of senior corporate managers was analyzed to examine how corporate elites in India frame their approach to sustainability issues and respond to external pressures for deeper corporate responsibility. The findings point to the existence of a distinctively local narrative with strong potential for the discursive negotiation of personal and collective understanding of ethical and socio-cultural values that may help internalize broader sustainability considerations into corporate decision-making processes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Discourse; Environment; Sustainability; Sustainable development",

The general research question explored is whether a course on ethical decision-making in business could positively influence students' confidence in their abilities to handle ethical problems at work (i.e., moral efficacy), boost the relative importance of ethics in their work lives (i.e., moral meaningfulness), and encourage them to be more courageous in raising ethical problems at work even if it is unpopular (i.e., moral courage). Specifically, the study used a rigorous quasi-experimental pretest-posttest research design with a treatment (N = 30) and control group (N = 30) to investigate whether a graduate-level course in business ethics could influence students' levels of moral efficacy, meaningfulness, and courage. Findings revealed that participants in the business ethics treatment course experienced significant positive increases in each of the three outcome variables as compared to the control group.

In addition to confirm the increased association of Islamic financial values with ethical practices in the West, our results allow us to understand how the observed growth of the industry has been conceptualized by conventional agents.

Using an event study of 1,294 product introduction announcements of 107 publicly listed U.S. family firms, the authors find that the presence of the founding family's name as part of a family firm's name acts as a valuable firm resource, increasing the abnormal stock returns surrounding the firm's new product introductions. Superior returns to family-named firms' new product introductions are partially mediated by these firms' history of ethical product-related behavior: family-named firms, particularly those with corporate branding, and those wherein a founding family member holds the CEO or chairman position, are more likely to exhibit a history of avoiding such product-related controversies as product safety issues, and deceptive advertising.

This is mainly because of the growth of social networking sites, which has also developed e-commerce. The current development in e-commerce opened a new stream, entitled social commerce, which is using social technologies to create an environment for generating social interactions. These social interactions can drive online social support in e-commerce, which in turn is creating trust and an increased intention to use social commerce. Design/methodology/approach - This research used social support theory and related theories on intention to use to propose a theoretical framework for the adoption of social commerce. Findings - The model predicts that forums and communities, ratings, reviews, referrals and recommendations are helping to introduce new business plans for e-vendors. The model also shows trust is an on-going issue in e-commerce and can be built through social commerce constructs. Research limitations/implications - There is limited research in the area of social commerce which this study seeks to redress. This study proposes a new model which can be extended by other constructs. However, the research needs to empirically test the constructs of the proposed model and their relationship. Originality/value - This paper introduces social commerce constructs, namely; recommendations and referrals, forums and communities and rating and reviews. The bases of the model proposed in this research are IT adoption and literature in the area such as PU and intention to buy or trust. These highlight the key role of ICT in the behaviour of online customers. This can be a development for e-commerce adoption models and the results signify that IS has a reference discipline for the behaviour of online consumers. This is an issue in marketing where not enough attention is paid to the importance of IT and IS. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This is curious because such tax payments are often considered a fundamental and easily measured example of a company's citizenship behavior. However, because the payment of corporate tax can often be legally avoided, this activity represents a boundary condition for CSR. If the law and CSR suggest that a company should pay its fair share of tax, yet many successful companies actively avoid this social obligation, should they be considered socially irresponsible. This paper explores the issue of tax avoidance and the implications it has for any credible definition and measure of CSR. It also highlights an aspect of corporate practice that is deliberately hidden from public view. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; CSR; Law; Tax avoidance",

We propose that in our context of study, corporate social performance constitutes an investment and managers who own significant parts of the company are more likely to promote corporate philanthropic actions. Using a hand-collected database that includes firm-level data on corporate contributions after the Sichuan Earthquake on 12 May 2008, we find that higher managerial ownership is associated with a significantly higher probability of donation and charity.

Is the relationship between financial transparency and CSR activities affected by the business group affiliation and ownership structure of firms? Research Findings/Insights: CSR ratings are negatively correlated with the level of earnings management when all firms are considered. However, the relationship is weaker for chaebol firms and firms with highly concentrated ownership, which suggests that CSR practices can be abusively used by those firms to conceal their poor earnings quality. The adverse use of CSR is discouraged if the fraction of shares owned by institutional investors is high. However, no evidence is found for a similar moderating effect for foreign investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that the business group affiliation and the ownership structure of a firm are important factors in determining the managerial incentives to engage in CSR, which can explain the mixed results reported in previous research. In addition, the possibility of a simultaneous relationship between CSR and other key firm characteristics, such as earnings quality, should be considered when conducting research on CSR. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides the insight to investors and other stakeholders that the managerial incentives behind CSR activities can differ depending on a firm's characteristics. Care must be taken when assessing the CSR activities, in particular, of firms with weak corporate governance. For policy makers, it is important to ensure that CSR-related disclosures by firms are based on actual plans and are not intended to deceive stakeholders, especially when the firms are not actively monitored by external shareholders. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Business groups; Corporate governance; Corporate social performance; Financial disclosure; Institutional shareholder",

However, much of this information mirrors the paper versions of financial reports, often with little attempt to enhance the decision usability of the data, providing a so called 'first generation' of online reporting (ICAEW, 2004). eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) has been designed to provide a 'second generation' of online reporting, specifically to enhance the usability of the data. Documents rendered in XBRL are digitally-enabled so that it is easier for stakeholders to extract information directly into spreadsheets, or any other XBRL-enabled analysis software, without the need to re-key data thus providing significant improvements in information flows and enhancing inter-company comparability.XBRL consortia have spent more than 15 years promulgating the use of this technology within the business and government communities. However, despite their efforts XBRL has not become widely diffused, there is little stakeholder engagement and very few organisations have voluntarily adopted XBRL in practice.The results of a questionnaire survey in the UK indicate that awareness of XBRL, and second generation reporting more generally, resides in key champions but there is little diffusion outside this narrow set of stakeholders. Regulatory engagement seems to be the only impetus for diffusion and better channels of communication within stakeholder networks, such as between regulators, preparers, users and the XBRL community are needed. This paper suggests that currently the supply-push for XBRL is failing to produce effective use of this technology in the UK. Greater regulatory commitment is now needed to create an impetus for XBRL such as creating tools and making publicly available, accessible, repositories of XBRL data. Unless this happens, diffusion will not occur, and the demand-pull which is now needed will vanish and XBRL will fade and die. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Diffusion; Financial reporting; Internet reporting; Stakeholder Engagement; XBRL",

This democratic deficit is significant, especially when multinational corporations operate in locations where national governance mechanisms are weak or even fail, where the rule of law is absent and there is a lack of democratic control. This deficit may lead to a decline in the social acceptance of the business firm and its corporate political activities and, thus, to a loss of corporate legitimacy. Under these conditions corporations may compensate for the emerging democratic deficit and reestablish their legitimacy by internalizing democratic mechanisms within their organizations, in particular in their corporate governance structures and procedures.

Utilitarianism is already widely used as a business ethic approach, although it is not well developed in the literature. Utilitarianism provides a guiding framework of decision making rooted in social benefit which helps direct business toward more ethical behavior. It is the basis for much of our discussion regarding the failures of Enron, Worldcom, and even the subprime mess and Wall Street Meltdown. In short, the negative social consequences are constantly referred to as proof of the wrongness of these actions and events, and the positive social consequences of bailouts and other plans are used as ethical support for those plans to right the wrongs. I believe the main cause of the neglect of the utilitarian approach is because of misguided criticisms. Here, I defend utilitarianism as a basis for business ethics against many criticisms found in the business ethics literature, showing that a business ethics approach relying on John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism supports principles like justice, is not biased against the minority, and is more reasonable than other views such as a Kantian view when dealing with workers and making other decisions in business. I also explain utilitarian moral motivation and use satisficing theory to attempt to defend utilitarian business ethics from questions raised regarding utilitarian calculus. © 2013 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

The positive indirect path suggested that yielding to temptation (e.g., high cognitive impairment and lack of self-control) led to poor MI (low stewardship behavior, but high cognitive meaning) that, in turn, led to high unethical intentions (theft, corruption, and deception). Our counterintuitive negative direct path revealed that those who controlled their temptation had high unethical intentions. Due to the multiple faces of temptation (the suppression effect), maliciously controlled temptation (low cognitive impairment and high self control) led to deviant intentions. Subsequent multi-group analysis across gender (a moderator) reformulated the mystery of temptation: a negative direct path for males, but a positive indirect path for females. For males, the negative direct path generated a dark impact on unethical intentions; for females, the positive indirect path did not, but offered great implications for consumer behavior.

Discovering the latent communities therein is a useful way to better understand the properties of a virtual social network. Traditional community-detection tasks only consider the structural characteristics of a social organization, but more information about nodes and edges such as semantic information cannot be exploited. What is more, the typical size of virtual spaces is now counted in millions, if not billions, of nodes and edges, most existing algorithms are incapable to analyze such large scale dense networks. In this paper, we first introduce an interesting social network model (Interest Network) in which links between two IDs are built if they both participate to the discussions about one or more topics/stories. In this case, we say both of the connected two IDs have the similar interests. Then, the edges of the initial network are updated using the attitude consistency information of the connected ID pairs. For a given ID pair i and j, they may together reply to some topics/IDs. The implicit orientations/attitudes of these two IDs to their together-reply topics/IDs may not be the same. We use a simple statistical method to calculate the attitude consistency, the value of which is between 0 and 1, and the higher value corresponds to a greater degree of consistency of the given ID pair to topics/IDs. The updated network is called Similar-View Network (SVN). In the second part, a fast parallel modularity optimization algorithm (FPMQA) that performs the analogous greedy optimization as CNM and FUC is used to conduct community discovering. By using the parallel manner and sophisticated data structures, its running time is essentially fast, O(kmax(kmax+〈k〉logkmax)). Finally, we propose an evaluation metric, which is based on the reliable ground truths, for online network community detection. In the experimental work, we evaluate our method using real datasets and compare our approach with several previous methods; the results show that our method is more effective and accurate in find potential online communities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, we identify tensions between the idea that the respect of human rights is a perfect moral duty for corporations and the Principle's 'human rights due diligence' requirement. We argue that the effectiveness of the 'human rights due diligence' is in many respects dependent upon the moral commitment of corporations. The Principles leave room for an instrumental or strategic implementation of due diligence, which in some cases could result in a depreciation of the fundamental norms they seek to promote. We reveal some limits of pragmatic approaches to coping with business-related human rights abuses. As these limits become more apparent, not only does the case for further progress in international and extraterritorial human rights law become more compelling, but so too does the argument for a more forceful discussion on the moral foundations of human rights duties for corporations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate responsibility; Human rights; Moral duties; Moral rights; Ruggie Principles",

Results demonstrate the reliability and validity of this new scale in two different samples.

While some scholars argue that there is a profitable market at the pyramid base, others refute this proposition, arguing that targeting poor people as customers could lead to unethical business practices and further their exploitation. With the aid of mini cases, this article explains that there is indeed a fortune to be made at the base of the pyramid but that good fortune can be created for both corporations and poor people if the population at the bottom of the pyramid is treated as suppliers, producers, co-owners, and/or employees rather than as mere consumers. However, in terms of consumers, there is a market for firms at the base of the pyramid through which they can earn profits and simultaneously help eradicate poverty, mainly by lowering the cost structure for poor people. In other words, firms that can reduce poverty and provide cost-effective utilitarian goods and services to poor people have more to gain from such individuals than those firms that provide more luxurious goods and services or offer goods with mere aesthetic or emotional value. With the help of mini cases, this article explains four measures firms can use to create fortunes for themselves as well as for poor customers by avoiding affordability and adaptability traps. © 2013 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","Affordability trap; Business ethics; India; Microfinance; Poverty premium",

From the get-go, however, extractive industry companies have fiercely opposed the new mandatory disclosure requirements as set out in this regulation. The corporate opposition is for the largest part motivated by the fear of a competitive disadvantage that derives from the fact that the amendment is housed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and thus only holds jurisdiction over those that report to the SEC. Although on the one hand watering down these corporate fears, this article draws on the ""shared value approach"" and empirical evidence to argue that there is a business case for transparency.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 153 respondents (45 per cent Omanis and 55 per cent expatriates) shared their expectations which were compared with documentary evidence from core large and medium-sized enterprises' CSR practice in Oman. Findings - On average, CSR mean scores exhibited similarity for most respondent groups except for Omanis, young people, and those with high school or lower education who scored less, indicating a general lack of awareness of CSR. Society in Oman seems to expect corporations to provide ""safe and reliable products/services"", ""appropriately treat employees"", ""behave ethically"", and be ""committed to social responsibility"".

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses examples obtained from a critical incidents approach to interviews with a small sample of German and British luxury consumers. Informants were asked to identify extremely positive and then extremely negative incidents which affected their perceptions of luxury brands. This critical incidents approach allowed for a clearer focus on the negative incidents and allowed identification of common themes that may be related to extreme negative affect. Findings: The evaluation of negative incidents which the informants named suggest that country of origin, consumer dissatisfaction with service, and negative stereotypes of luxury brand users are potential antecedents of brand hate within the luxury sector. Some types of advertising might heighten the latter effect. Consumers' perceptions of corporate social performance did not seem to be a strong source of brand hate, yet the respondents stressed the significance of luxury brands to act responsibly. Thus, it is important for luxury brands to avoid potential dissonance in the way consumers perceive them. Research limitations/implications: This primarily conceptual paper uses examples from Germany and the UK. Therefore, it is recommended to continue with studies in other countries, including emerging economies, to identify potential cross-cultural differences. Furthermore, it would be interesting to ascertain which factors are the most significant in evoking extreme negative brand affect. Practical implications: The core reputation of the luxury brand is a common theme which is identified as a driving force of brand hate. Brand practitioners therefore need to consider how to build a strong positive reputation in order to withstand the immediate and long-term consequences of brand hate. Originality/value: The need to investigate antecedents of extreme negative affect as manifested in brand hate reflects a gap in extant literature on luxury brand management. Therefore, the authors contend that their conceptualization of antecedents of affect will have important theoretical and practical implications within the field of luxury brand management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Anti-consumption; Brand avoidance; Brand hate; Brand image; Brand management; Brand rejection; Consumer behaviour; Luxury",

While numerous business management, leadership, and human resource management texts have for years emphasized the relevance of ethical values for moral leadership, only in the last few years has research into the nature and applicability of business ethics multiplied. But, notwithstanding, the sphere of business and leadership ethics still appears indefinite. While some locate business ethics more upon a corporate, system level within concepts such as corporate social responsibility and sustainability, others position ethical values at the level of some kind of leader-follower relationship. From a somewhat normative perspective, individual leadership is being examined using ethical dimensions such as 'good' or 'bad' leadership skills. In particular, in the business literature, exploratory research into the fundamental moral dimension of leadership is limited. This paper will investigate the dichotomy of ethics in practice and theory in an attempt to identify a new framework for applied ethics in leadership. To this end, the absolute essence of ethical and moral behavior needs to be revisited. By examining several international business programs' ethics and leadership education, this research will highlight the imperative to differentiate between ethics and morals, both in theory and practice. © Common Ground, Sabine H.

The paper presents the notion and the basics of corporate volunteering (CV), with emphasis on its capacity to strengthen the bonds between the company and its employees. Design/methodology/approach: With the intention of approaching the actual state of corporate volunteering, a survey was conducted of Spanish firms regarding their managers' perceptions of the main success factors and the potential benefits and costs of CV programs. Findings: In the contemporary Spanish business environment, companies have incorporated volunteer initiatives as a key element of their corporate responsibility strategy. The importance of the practice of CV is interpreted as a symptom of commitment to a stronger socially responsible behavior in Spanish companies. Practical implications: To stay well informed of employees' needs, to evaluate which NGOs to work with or human resource management responsiveness, the authors put forward recommendations for CV programs designed to increase both competitive sustainability and employee satisfaction and retention. Originality/value: Reflecting the literature which highlights the importance of CV in Spain, the results indicate that while organizations strive to achieve corporate responsibility goals, it is expected that effectiveness will be greater among organizations using CV for this purpose.

Design/methodology/approach: Desk-based research was carried out. Findings: The scope of the paper is confined to two major aspects of the criminal law - that of manslaughter, both statutory and at common law and also touches on the range of health and safety offences available to the courts. In terms of manslaughter, under the common law, it is gross negligence that is considered. Research limitations/implications: The paper does not attempt an analysis of forms of civil liability but does reflect on the broader relationship between responsibility of directors and company law. The debate over the responsibility of those in leading positions following death or injury to members of the workforce remains a live and problematic one. It is clearly linked to wider considerations of corporate responsibility. Originality/value: On the one hand, those advocates of a system targeting erring directors in a direct fashion see utilisation of the criminal law (apportioning the full weight of public opprobrium), as the most effective way of improving safety for the workforce. By contrast the opposing view is that senior personnel rarely set out to kill or injure those who work for them and that a better way forward is to consider systemic failings running across an organisation. Linked to this is the notion that placing too much responsibility on companies and the senior personnel at their helm is a disincentive to the entrepreneurial spirit that allows business to flourish. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Death; Directors; Gross negligence manslaughter; Health and safety; Statutory manslaughter; Workplace injury",

Specifically, we tested two predictive models: the first explored the influence of REP dimensions on place attachment dimensions as tested in previous research; the second explored the influence of place attachment dimensions on REP dimensions alluded to, but not tested, previously. Contrary to expectations, our results did not support the model in which REP predicts place attachment development. Interestingly, our results support the second model and indicate that select place attachment dimensions predict REP dimensions. This positive influence of place attachment on REP dimensions empirically supports the notion that attachment to a setting may influence motivations to visit that setting. Specifically, findings suggest that meaningful social relationships nurtured within the resource encourage visitors to learn, be more knowledgeable, or teach about the resource, and experience quiet, solitude and personal growth. Additionally, respondents' dependence on the resource motivates them to be among others like themselves.

Using stakeholder theory, we specifically propose that several factors increase the salience and impact of stakeholders' demands on the firm and that, in response to these factors, a firm's CSP will have greater breadth. A firm's CSP breadth is operationalized as the number of different sub-domains of CSR for which a firm has taken positive actions and is captured using a unique dataset from Kinder, Lydenburg, and Domini (KLD). This data set includes positive and negative firm actions across more than 35 different dimensions of socially responsible behavior. Findings based on a longitudinal, multi-industry sample of 447 US firms during the period from 2000 to 2007 demonstrate that firms which: (1) have greater sensitivity to stakeholder needs as a result of the firm's strategic emphasis on marketing and/or value creation, (2) face greater diversity of stakeholder demands, and (3) encounter a greater degree of scrutiny or risk from stakeholder action have a greater breadth of CSP in response to the stakeholder landscape that they face. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social performance (CSP); KLD database; Stakeholder theory",

Accordingly, stakeholder management becomes more complicated. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) in South China is a major port region with Hong Kong and Shenzhen being its largest ports. In view of Hong Kong's gradual integration within China's national and regional planning, there is an increasing need for cooperation among the ports in the PRD region, in order to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. This study aims to analyze the major conflicts and mutual benefits encountered by Hong Kong and Shenzhen ports and thereby formulate strategies for stakeholder management from the governmental perspective in establishing sustainable regional port governance.

It is suggested that while Islamic teaching treats profits as reward for engaging in vital activities necessary for serving societal interests, profit maximization is not sanctioned and therefore should not be the goal of ethically guided business ventures. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Islamic ethics; Islamic logic; Islamic perspectives; Profit maximization; Stakeholder theory",

However, making ethical assessments that in turn influence behavior is much more complicated than it appears. One of the most important developments in contemporary philosophy has been the renewed interest in epistemic virtue. Epistemologists contend that belief is an ethical process that is susceptible to the intellectual virtue or vice of one's own life and personal experiences. Open-mindedness, curiosity, careful thinking, creativity, and intellectual courage are the foundations of epistemic virtues. Closed-mindedness, intellectual overconfidence, unimaginativeness, intellectual conformity, and wishful thinking are among epistemic vices. The purpose of this investigation is to introduce epistemology to marketing ethics by linking it to personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism) and optimism to explain various ethically challenging organizational behaviors. The items of epistemology were developed and pretested by the lead author of this study. Structural equations (LISREL) analyses found that epistemic virtues and vices are better predictors of ethical behavior than were personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism), and their influence on mild and severe levels of unethical behaviors was enhanced by the moderator variable, optimism. Implications are designed to develop suggestions for improving ethical behavior in the workplace. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Epistemic vices; Epistemic virtues; Idealism; Optimism; Relativism; Unethical organizational practices; Virtue theory",

The study, therefore, appraises the responsibilities of businesses based on a strictly just and fair relationship with all the stakeholders. So that corporations are only and 'strictly expected' to do what is right and fair at all times-being ethical. The study suggests that corporate responsibilities can be classified from three guises namely primary (which are about a business's survival in its market and industry), secondary (which is about its responsibilities as a corporate citizen) and tertiary (this in effect is discretionary and is about its moral obligations to society and its stakeholders). The study observes that all corporate responsibilities, except philanthropy, can be and should be discharged by corporations and that this will only mean doing the right things which have been argued to be good for business. The study is also of the opinion that if corporations are fair especially with, measure and value as they relate to price, philanthropy will rarely be possible and may even be unnecessary. The study, therefore, concludes that rather than cutting corners in terms of their charitable obligations, corporations should be compelled to do what is right and to act fairly in their dealings with stakeholders. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Focus on systems of accountability can actually detract from the production of ethical behaviour. A number of examples are provided. Although it is much more difficult to produce, individual responsible decision-making and individual judgment should be the features that an organisation focuses on in its interest to promote ethical performance. Accountability systems are important; but they have very limited application toward production of an ethically excellent environment.

The implementation of such irresponsible employee practices in some suppliers has badly affected the business performance and reputation of global giants like Nike, Adidas, and Apple. The study here conceptualizes employee rights protection as a management initiative concerning an organization's efforts in managing employees responsibly. By drawing from the literature on social initiatives and supply chain management, organizations should adopt employee rights protection to improve their corporate reputation and financial performance, and that it is important for buyers to involve suppliers to implement such an initiative in order to improve the financial performance of both parties in the buyer-supplier relationship. Based on data collected from 200 matched pairs of manufacturers and suppliers in the food, pharmaceutical, automotive, and clothing industries of China, all the posited hypotheses of this research receive support.

Methodology/Approach: The authors' propositions are tested with a survey sample of 221 firms in the U.K. construction industry. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are used to analyze the survey data. Findings: The independence of the 3 focal constructs of trust, reliance, and dependence is confirmed. The formative index is found suitable for evaluating the level of relationship quality in which reliance carries more significant weight than trust. Research Implications: The separation of the overall construct of ""trust"" into trust at interpersonal level and reliance at interorganizational level, as found in this study, overcomes the problem existing in past studies that researchers rarely specify at which level trust operates. The clear conceptual distinction between reliance and dependence as found in this study implies that although both operate at the organizational level, they do not have overlapping boundaries. The finding that reliance is a more important impact factor than trust in constructing the formative index supports the notions that reliance is a necessary and sufficient condition for developing sustainable business relationships, and trust is an insufficient condition to sustain an ongoing business relationship. Practical Implications: Reliance sets the keynote of the business relationship. In contrast, trust as the interpersonal variable only acts as the facilitator to create a favorable social environment. Nevertheless, both trust and reliance have a significant and positive weight in the relationship quality index formed. This means that a business relationship with high levels of both trust and reliance is particularly resilient and stable and is the most successful and desirable one which is frequently oriented toward the long run. Originality/Value/Contribution: The confirmation of the difference between trust and reliance makes an important contribution to the study of trust in business to business marketing by showing that what has traditionally been treated as theoverall construct of trust can and should be regarded as being made up of two separate constructs: interpersonal trust and interorganizational reliance. The difference between reliance and dependence as an additional finding makes another important contribution by providing conceptual clarity of the two constructs and confirming that there is no overlapping boundary between them.

A social network is a social structure made up of nodes connected by a set of ties. Social capital, in turn, refers to the structure, content, and perception of one's social relationships in the network. This paper presents an in-depth survey of the methods of using SNSC in leadership and management research. I first review how network scholars determine network boundaries, choose sampling techniques, and collect network data. I follow with a comprehensive survey of the statistical tools and analytical strategies prevalent in SNSC research. I then investigate the methodological rigor of 110 SNSC empirical studies in leadership and other management fields. My results show that 8.1% (3/37) specified network boundaries, 43.2% (49/103) used surveys to collect network data, and 52.3% (58/110) implemented at least one reviewed method. A further assessment reveals that only 39.7% (23/58) of papers somewhat justified the appropriateness of using such methods. The frequency distribution of coding criteria was similar across journals and over time.

This paper investigates how businesses might create balanced social, environmental and economic value through integrating sustainability more fully into the core of their business. A value mapping tool is developed to help firms create value propositions better suited for sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: In addition to a literature review, six sustainable companies were interviewed to understand their approaches to business modelling, using a case study approach. Building on the literature and practice, a tool was developed which was pilot tested through use in a workshop. The resulting improved tool and process was subsequently refined through use in 13 workshops. Findings: A novel value mapping tool was developed to support sustainable business modelling, which introduces three forms of value (value captured, missed/destroyed or wasted, and opportunity) and four major stakeholder groups (environment, society, customer, and network actors). Practical implications: This tool intends to support business modelling for sustainability by assisting firms in better understanding their overall value proposition, both positive and negative, for all relevant stakeholders in the value network. Originality/value: The tool adopts a multiple stakeholder view of value, a network rather than firm centric perspective, and introduces a novel way of conceptualising value that specifically introduces value destroyed or wasted/ missed, in addition to the current value proposition and new opportunities for value creation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business model; Business model innovation; Sustainability; Sustainable business model; Sustainable value; Value creation",

Little has been written on how organisations in developing countries innovate and employ innovations in a sustainable manner. This paper presents a case study of an innovation business in a partially developed country, but which was taken over by a South African organisation. The purpose of this paper is to study why the venture failed and what lessons this case study offers to future developing country innovators. Design/methodology/approach: The paper refers to the literature that addresses business projects in emerging countries and analyses the actions of a South African company that set out to develop commercial nuclear electricity generation using the pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) technology. The approach adopted in the paper is an assessment of the events and actions that led to the project's failure. Findings: The management of the project was flawed from the start because of a lack of measurable milestones and budgetary constraints. The South African government continued to fund the project while not controlling it. Technically, the project was too ambitious and it is not certain whether the project could ever have come to fruition. Research limitations/implications: The generalisability of results from case study research needs to be treated with some caution, but similar findings in different contexts may strengthen internal validity, and in turn lead to wider generalisability. Practical implications: The paper reinforces the challenges faced by businesses in emerging countries when developing innovative products. The need for financial control and technical milestones is emphasised even though innovations are by definition uncertain. Social implications: The benefits from the PBMR could have been significant, but the project failed at a cost of $1bn, which a country such as South Africa could ill afford. The knowledge gained during the duration of the project will be of little benefit to the country, particularly as the knowledge context was extremely narrow.

This study utilized failure modes and effects analysis to construct a model of materiality analysis for determining material issues to be included in sustainability reporting as in the case of Lite-On Technology Corporation in Taiwan. This study employed three FMEA indices: Occurrence (O), which can be determined from the percentage of concerned stakeholders; likelihood of being detected (D), which refers to the level of concern among stakeholders; and severity (S), which can be quantified from the impact of issues on the strategic communication objective. The analytic network process was applied to determine the relative weights of the three indices. A risk priority number of materiality analysis was then calculated for each issue, which is provided by the companies to identify material issues of information disclosure in sustainability reporting.

Based on this desk exercise, five universities were selected according to the nature and structure of their training programmes and geographical spread such that one university was included from Wales, Scotland, South of England, Midlands and North of England. The next stage of the research focused on gaining in-depth understanding of the enterprise training available to PRGs at selected universities through face-to-face semi-structured interviews with key personnel responsible for the design and management of PGR enterprise education programmes. The data collected were analysed using the Rugby Team Impact Framework to explore the training and development provision and structure, internal and external profile raising and awareness, staff and skills required, research-based practices, the reaction of participants, behaviour and outcomes, stakeholder engagement and on-going strategy. Findings: The paper highlights the current best practices in enterprise education for PGRs. It identified key factors contributing to the success of selected programmes including the development of objectives, the modes and pedagogy of delivery and the involvement of stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The results of the research enable universities across the UK to drive the development of a suite of learning opportunities tailored to the needs of the PGR population in order to overcome barriers to engagement and best promote entrepreneurial activity - both within employment and as new venture creation - as appropriate career options. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the limited literature concerning the state of enterprise training for PGRs which provides a detail analysis of current provisions useful for benchmarking and planning purposes and which can be useful to researchers and enterprise education providers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Enterprise education; Higher education institution; Postgraduate researchers",

In the investment industry, these wider sets of value drivers are known as environment-socialgovernance (ESG) factors. A small number of specialized ESG rating agencies provide information to investors about the extent to which firms' behaviors are socially responsible. However, a major criticism of these rating agencies is the lack of transparency in their methods. This paper aims to examine the issues of subjectivity, transparency and uniformity of ESG ratings by exploring the methods used to assess ethics performance by an Australian rating agency. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was conducted on an Australian ESG rating provider, Regnan. The data for the analysis were sourced from internal Regnan documents. Findings - The paper found that a level of subjectivity is inevitable in ESG ratings and the call for uniformity may inhibit innovation, but these issues can be addressed by increased transparency of the rating methods. Research limitations/implications - Further research is required to understand what level and, combination of, uniformity and transparency is sufficient to satisfy stakeholder requirements for ESG information. Practical implications - The discussion of the factors underlying the ethics performance rating may prompt more open and transparent debate on how to assess ethical performance of companies, and increase investor confidence in ESG ratings. It may also provide more direction to companies on how to strengthen their ethical performance. Originality/value - There is growing recognition that numerous business drivers contribute to financial performance and investment returns but they are not included in a company's profit and loss statements. These ""ESG"" factors can account for up to 66 percent of the market value of globally listed companies. In response to calls for more transparency on how ESG factors are assessed, and how ethical performance is appraised, this paper attempts to lift the veil on ESG rating methods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Corporate social performance; Environment-social-governance; ESG performance; ESG rating agencies; Ethics performance",

Design/methodology/approach - This is an exploratory survey based on interviews with senior executives from British and Brazilian companies operating in the steel, petroleum and retail sectors, that makes comparisons between and within them. Findings - The British companies interviewed are more rule-based, adopt an implicit CSR approach, react to stakeholders' demands based on moral motives, and focus on environmental issues. The Brazilian companies reviewed in this study adopt an explicit CSR approach, have relational motives to engage with stakeholders, and are more concerned with building a responsible image and narrowing social gaps.

The aim of the research question is to map out the consequences upon CSR derived from the crisis and to derive new principles of future CSR models to come consistent with the consequences of the financial crisis, and to suggest new research as well as policy-making possibilities to highlight the importance and necessary survival of CSR as an instrument for sustainable and financial progress. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a literature review of CSR prior to and after the financial crisis 2008, with an emphasis on academic papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Findings - The findings of the paper reveal that post-crisis CSR-models do not articulate anything that has not been mentioned before; however , they do strengthen former values of CSR, but still lack an overall formula of how the financial sector can adopt CSR in the core of their businesses, and transparently display their products, and the risk adhering to them. The paper proposes a new Four-""E""-Principle that may guide new CSR-models to accomplish this deficit. See under "" Originality"". Practical implications - The paper calls for a discussion on ways in which governments and businesses can enhance social responsibility, though balancing the requirements of more engagement from businesses, as well as public sector companies in CSR. This paper suggests some instrumental mechanisms of how governments can engage, not only multinational companies, but also smaller companies, and other kinds of organizations acting on the market, to make them engage more in CSR. Originality/value - The paper proposes a new Four-""E""-Principle to guide the development of new CSR-models based upon the core of Schwartz and Carroll's ""Three-domain CSR-model"", which the Principle extends and revises to: Economy, L/Egal, Environment, and Ethics. This Principle disentangles the dialectic relationship between economic and social responsibility; takes financial products into consideration; refines the definitions of good stakeholder engagement without the illusions of corporate ""Potemkinity"" and considers the benefit of replacing the semiotic meaning of the ""C"" in CSR from ""corporate"" to ""capitalism's social responsibility"" in order to extend the concept towards a broader range of market agents. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR-concepts; Financial crisis; Financial sector; Government role",

Findings - Students' views of work and experiences on the job predicted both their views of college ethics training and their ability to identify ethical issues from a set of scenarios. Students' perceptions of their degrees as valuable credentials and their feelings that ethical behavior is the ""norm"" in business were the strongest predictors in both instances. Research limitations/implications - While the regression analyses were significant, they explained relatively little of the variance. Practical implications - In designing programs to promote ethical behaviors among future managers, university personnel should bear in mind that students' experiences on the job help to determine the manner in which they view university ethics training.

We find that credit rating agencies tend to award relatively high ratings to firms with good social performance. This pattern is robust to controlling for key firm characteristics as well as endogeneity between CSR and credit ratings. We also find that CSR strengths and concerns influence credit ratings and that the individual components of CSR that relate to primary stakeholder management (i.e., community relations, diversity, employee relations, environmental performance, and product characteristics) matter most in explaining firms' creditworthiness. Overall, our results suggest that CSR performance conveys important non-financial information that rating agencies are likely to use in their evaluation of firms' creditworthiness, and that CSR investments-particularly those that extend beyond compliance behavior to reflect what is desired by society-can lead to lower financing costs resulting from higher credit ratings. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Credit ratings",

Recent examples of moral failures which have emerged in both corporate and public sector organisations in the UK during recent years have prompted a review of some of the literature about the teaching of business ethics in and by business schools. While the use of theoretical approaches to ethical analysis (such as consequentialist and deontological approaches), coupled with the discussion of scenarios or cases is a common way of structuring the teaching of business and organisational ethics, it may be limited as an approach insofar as it does not necessarily address the affective aspects of the learning process which contribute to the development of moral sensitivity and moral character. It is suggested that an action learning approach may help fill this gap, particularly if coupled with an Aristotelian focus on the development of moral character. Action learning as a technique seeks to replace instruction with facilitation, and to enable individual personal growth rather than the acquisition of knowledge. It emphasises practical action in the workplace and working with peers as part of an action learning set. The action learning method may be more suitable to fostering both technical/scientific wisdom (poeisis) and practical or prudential wisdom (phronesis) and could be adapted for use with both business students and practising managers. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","action learning; Aristotle; business ethics; Revans; virtue ethics",

Results reveal how these different theories combine to provide a more comprehensive explanation of buyer behavior than existed in prior literature. Using structural equation modeling of a sample of 328 procurement transactions, factors found to affect buyer opportunism included buyer power, corporate ethical values, honesty/integrity, leader opportunism, willful ignorance, and subjective expected utility. This study also provides empirical support for distinguishing between two types of opportunism - strong and weak. The research concludes with implications for theory and practice, limitations, and areas for future research. © 2013.","Business ethics; Buyer-supplier relationship; Ethics; Opportunism; Procurement",

We specifically consider the Torah because it is the primary document of Judaism, the source of all the basic Biblical commandments, and a framework of ethics. A distinctive feature of Jewish ethics is its interpretive approach to moral philosophy: that is, immersion and sense making in a dense, lived-in, complicated moral world, which is particularly useful with regard to ethical analyses of the workplace. Rather than discover or create a new ethic for the employer-employee relationship, we seek to harness general principles and norms from the Torah to contemporary business conditions. In the spirit of sustainability, rather than plunder the new, we recreate from existing resources. Interpretations from the Torah provide a rich source of moral and practical guidance for contemporary business ethics while also responding to academic and popular interest in spirituality and business. These tenets, however, have not to date been specifically directed at current predicaments in employment. We redress this by deriving principles from the Torah and applying them to ethical issues in contemporary employment practices. Practical guidance for both research in and practice of employment ethics is also provided. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Employees; Employment ethics; Ethical principles; Social sustainability; Torah; Workplace practices",

The study verifies the existence of the five levels of the ethics management model within the hospitality and tourism context by performing a structured content analysis of corporate ethics disclosure of large global airline and hotel companies. The results support the thesis that practices related to the levels of ethics management exist. The airline cases demonstrate more similarity and are concentrated primarily in Level 4 (the progressive ethical organization), whereas the hotel cases illustrate a larger variance, ranging from Level 3 (the emergent ethical organization) to Level 5 (the ethical organization).

However along with the adoption, there have been concerns about risky issues regarding privacy leakages and information sharing hazards. Such risks are partially due to the fact that seniors (knowingly or unknowingly) share private information that may be misused by others. In this paper we explore the privacy-preserving actions regarding information sharing for this demography on one social media platform - Facebook. Facebook is the largest social networking platform today and many of its privacy related practices have been in the news recently. More specifically, we study the information sharing behavior of the elderly by observing the extent to which they opt out of sharing information publicly about themselves on their profile pages. In addition, we also observe how much overlap exists between these older Facebook users and their respective friends in terms of their public information sharing habits and explore the differences across gender.

Many fail, casting large and ominous shadows. We are inundated with their stories. We need to hear more often stories of those who have succeeded and why their examples are important to the field of Business Ethics. Design/methodology/approach - This chapter, after providing a brief overview of the differing uses of the term, Business Ethics, expands upon the metaphor of ""ethical space"" as the eye of a moral hurricane, provides diagrams illustrating the formation of ethical space in a business behavioral context, applies those diagrams to the examples of Andersen and Feuerstein as moral exemplars, discusses ways to mitigate the shadows that eclipsed their example, and suggests ways to enlarge corporate ethical space. Findings - Ethics is a habit learned through mentoring and developed through practice. In a world of conflicting influences, we each carve out our own ethical space that can serve as an example to others as they face their own individual ethical challenges, but at the corporate level, a moral exemplar will inform the larger corporate ethical space only when the leadership of the corporation consciously adopts and constantly reinforces the example of its moral exemplar. Originality/value - This chapter uses the visual metaphor of the eye of a hurricane to discuss the formation and importance of ethical space to moral exemplars in a world of conflicting influences and moral pressures.

Industry builds character, he argues, but it can also corrupt it. It is therefore very important to educate the ""moral sentiments"" and encourage sympathy especially in young people whose characters are still malleable. Vanity, Smith argues, is closely linked to the sentiment of sympathy and can be used as a stepping-stone to virtue. This chapter uses Smith's remarks on vanity as a perspective on contemporary business ethics education. In properly engaging and redirecting vanity, education can help students become impartial spectators. Seeing a promise in a character trait most people consider a vice, Smith offers a refreshing view relevant to business ethics education today.

We believe it is both necessary and beneficial for free market economic systems to be viewed as a moral exemplar by business students, educators, practitioners, and ethicists. Since much of the world operates under some type of free market economic paradigm, it is important that there be a moral base for these operations. Free market economic systems are usually defended on utilitarian grounds, that they produce better results than other systems. In this chapter we take a micro approach and show that free market economic systems support individual rights and dignity. This is important because business persons need moral exemplars based in their own discipline's theory to recognize the vocational aspects of business. That is, business persons must understand why free market systems serve the greater good. Free market systems are not a complete or perfect moral exemplar. Business persons need to know the limits of the economic system and find other moral exemplars for their role as citizens. We illustrate this with the discussion of monopoly and Option for the Poor. Catholic Social Teaching (CST), the moral exemplar of the Roman Catholic Church, has been developed over many centuries. The purpose of this chapter is to show how free market economic outcomes are compatible with CST goals. Illustrating the consistency between CST and free market systems provides compelling evidence that such systems are indeed a moral exemplar for business persons.

This study addresses the basic perceptions regarding the teaching of business ethics and examines university lecturers' intentions to teach an ethics course. For the present research, the authors conducted a cross study to evaluate whether three variations of the theory of planned behavior, namely, TPB, decomposed TPB (DTPB), and the revised theory of planned behavior (RTPB), could adequately predict teaching of ethics course (TEC) behaviors. The participants were from southern, middle, and northern Taiwan. A structural equation model applied to a final sample of 200 usable questionnaires demonstrated that individual attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and teacher self-efficacy (TSE) influence intentions, but do not influence report behavior of those involved in teaching an ethics course. Among the three variations of TPB-based models, RTPB provided better explanation of variance in intentions to TEC. The present research highlights the importance of TSE, especially because TSE plays a key role in RTPB.

No doubt the analytical framework of value creation and value capture casts new light on the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship, but we think Santos is asking too much by advocating a shift in focus away from the organization. On the contrary, we maintain that by refocusing the theory on the organizational level and away from the system it is possible to understand that not all organizational solutions available to social entrepreneurs are able to create value and not all value capture strategies can serve a social goal. Indeed, there is only one form of organization that fulfills the criteria of maximizing on value creation, while satisficing on value capture and that is the social enterprise. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Market failures; Public goods; Social enterprise; Social entrepreneurship; Value appropriation; Value capture; Value creation",

During this period many large corporations have been found striving for ethical behavior and moral values, resulting in a backlash from various stakeholders. Unfortunately, the example set by large corporations and their perceptions, or even justifications, of correct or acceptable ""twisted"" ethical behavior always rubs off on small businesses. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether moral behavior will have an effect on the concern for ethical misconduct among South African entrepreneurs. Ethics and morality are two terms that are very closely related and often used interchangeably in the South African context. While ethics refers to the rules and conduct that are prescribed by society, morality is the internally accepted standards of individual behavior in a society. Therefore, business ethics are the principles that are prescribed by businesses and accepted within a business environment. The study shown that various constructs, regarding behavioral aspects, can be grouped to indicate the theme of moral behavior. The study convincingly showed that there does, in fact, exist a medium to strong relationship correlation between concern for ethical misconduct and moral behavior among South African entrepreneurs.

However, diversity should not be measured as a static number. To better understand the fast-changing terrain, the paper aims to strongly propose using the tracking signal method to dynamically monitor the efficiency performance in regard to the future of diversity and best practices. This will allow diversity to play a more strategic role in cultivating sustainable business growth. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs the tracking signal, widely used to monitor the performance of a forecasting model, with some extension to dynamically monitor the technical efficiency due to its ability in alarming out-of-control signals. Findings - The approach is considered as a quantitative, objective and reasonable evaluation system because it can quickly alert employees with inferior performance and promote those with persistently outstanding performance. It also provides managers the right timing to find assignable causes affecting their workers' performance. Most importantly, it can be unsophisticatedly implemented in many aspects of efficiency evaluation for assisting organizations to improve their competitive power through efficiency gains and well expedite their broadly managerial decisions. Originality/value - The majority of previous researches aggregate multi-dimensional efficiencies by different weighting strategies into a single index before making their judgments. These approaches mainly focus on the first phase of the decision-making procedure by considering the efficiency in a static-state. As efficiency is time-sensitive, it should be evaluated dynamically. Thus, serving as the second phase of the procedure, the method is a complement of previous researches. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Diversified management; Dynamic monitoring; Service efficiency; Tracking signal","Business organizations; Design/methodology/approach; Diversity managements; Dynamic monitoring; Efficiency evaluation; Out-of-control signals; Technical efficiency; Tracking signals; Human resource management; Managers; Efficiency"

While the literature has suggested many models to guide sustainable tourism, very few studies have investigated the green economy in a tourism context. The main distinguishing factor between the green economy and sustainable development may be described as the acknowledgement of climate change as an existential threat to society and the aim to avoid policy, management and governance fragmentation (which has been common for environmental issues) by addressing greenhouse gas emissions, resource efficiency and social inclusiveness holistically at the economic level. This study frames the green economy concept from a tourism perspective and presents a model for translating the green economy concept into a tourism stakeholder engagement process. The model was tested in the case study of Bali, Indonesia, involving research methods such as visioning group techniques with tourism stakeholders, tourism economy and employment forecasting, resource efficiency estimates as well as resident and visitor surveys.

The authors examine whether ethics education or more precisely, the lack thereof, played any role in this financial collapse, and whether business schools should contribute to molding moral characters of their students, who will ultimately become the next generation of business leaders. Here are a few important highlights of what has been found. First, a consensus seems to have been reached that business schools have an important role in developing the moral character of their students, something they haven't practiced sufficiently according to managers. Second, business schools ought to take a more direct part in a society's discourse on business ethics and perhaps be in the forefront of these discussions. Third, there is a clear need for not only asking business schools to contribute to molding the moral character of students but to reshaping that of practicing managers through re-training and continuous education. © 2014, IGI Global.",,

The ideas focus on (1) clarifying the phenomenon of tenacity; (2) looking at three foundations of our tenacity; and (3) asking ""How fragile is our tenacity?"" This article also presents three foundational principles that underlie the American experience of corporate responsibility. First, the Checks & Balances Principle tells us that there are checks and balances in democratic capitalism which give us confidence that the pursuit of economic goals will be moderated for the common good. Second, the Moral Projection Principle shows that there is good reason to consider the corporation not only as a legal person under corporate law but also as a moral person. And, last, the Moral Common Ground Principle reflects that there are shared moral values ascertainable by well-developed consciences in individuals and in corporations. The article concludes with this argument: The tenacity regarding corporate responsibility that has been so characteristic of American capitalism is fragile-calling for serious vigilance if it is to endure. © 2013 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Responsible management education must address three foundational challenges in business education if it is to actualize the aspirations of PRME: (1) it must confront the cognitional myth that knowing is like looking, (2) it must move beyond mere analysis to systems thinking, and (3) it must transition from a values-neutral stance to a values-driven stance. Using Developing Sustainable Strategies, an MBA practicum in the Sustainable Management Concentration at DePaul University's Kellstadt Graduate School of Business as a case study, this article identifies the ways in which Pragmatic Inquiry can address these challenges. The method of Pragmatic Inquiry prepares students to become responsible managers, to develop sustainable strategies, and to be creators of shared value. Built from the philosophical foundations of American pragmatism and Bernard Lonergan's critical realism, Pragmatic Inquiry is an effective method and pedagogy for responsible management education. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate responsibility; Leadership; Philosophical Foundations of Business; Pragmatic Inquiry; Sustainability; Teaching business ethics; UN Principles of Responsible Management Education; Value-based management",

They capacitate firms to govern numerous supplier relationships simultaneously toward ethical business conduct. Since many actors nowadays pursue the goal of ethical supplier management, a cascade of codes has emerged. However, this plurality poses multiple problems on its own account, such as lacking effectiveness of some of these codes, restrictions on the development of universally accepted ethical standards, and greenwashing. It also creates operational difficulties and unnecessary procedural costs for firms and is thus inefficient. The aggregated amount of issues suggests the development of a standardized supplier code of ethics as a remedy. Based on diffusion of innovation theory as theoretical lense and as conceptual support, we employ a multi-method research design to develop a design concept for such a standard. We begin with a content analysis of relevant scientific literature on content, adoption, and effectiveness of codes of ethics, in which we also study numerous extant codes and initiatives. It leads to six propositions on key success factors of a standardized supplier code of ethics. We then amend a design science approach to develop a design concept for such a standard that complies with these requirements, with the support of corporate experts from Germany, China, and India. Our results are informative about the content of a standardized supplier code of ethics, and we propose multiple effectiveness- and diffusion-facilitating mechanisms as additional components in the overall design concept.

The limiting conditions provide a basis for a co-creation process, (3) aligning business for co-creating a new product brand, and (4) broadening the scope towards market creation for animal friendly products. The phases of the issue-life-cycle show that interventions are dependent on the nature of the interaction and the existence of a business model.

Research shows that employees of all types are vital in the pursuit of sustainability, however, to date there is no one source that shows all of these identified types of employees and how they are involved in the sustainability process.

Among these, less than half generated a substantial number of responses from bloggers, which could not be identified as a specific group. While new product introductions led to positive buzz, modifications of current products resulted in more negative responses, even if there was a high fit with core business. While promotion-related press releases were received negatively in general, particularly periphery promotion (compared to core promotion) generated most reactions. Our exploratory study suggests that companies can increase the likelihood of a positive reaction if they carefully consider the fit between initiatives and their core business, while taking the notion of 'controversial fit', relating to the unhealthy nature of original products, into account.

This article examines the role of e-government in improving the transparency and accountability of the regulatory system. It emphasizes eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), an information standard that can improve financial transparency by making reported financial activity information machine-readable and comparable. The article draws from e-government studies, collaborative public management literature, and management information systems (MIS) literature to develop a strategic model of e-government XBRL implementation. The proposed model consists of an overarching leadership and governance strategy with three interrelated areas of activity: stakeholder relationship management, phase-in implementation, and value articulation and clarification. The implementation process and success factors articulated in the model are illustrated by the SEC's effort to implement XBRL. The conclusion presents policy and management lessons for better e-government implementation of XBRL and for improving transparency in regulatory systems. © 2013 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

While social media creates an important momentum for firms to cultivate favorable awareness by establishing a powerful framework of stakeholder relationships, the opportunities are not distributed evenly for all firms. In this paper, we investigate the impact of CSR credentials on the effectiveness of social media as a stakeholder-relationship management platform. The analysis of Fortune 500 companies in the Twitter sphere reveals that a higher CSR rating is a strong indicator of an earlier adoption, a faster establishment of online presence (followers), a higher responsiveness to the firm's identity (replies and mentions), and a stronger virality of the messages (retweets). Incidentally, the higher CSIR rating is also found to be associated with the stronger virality. Our findings also suggest that socially responsible firms can harvest proactive stakeholders' participation (user-driven communication) without investing more resources (firm-driven communication).

However, my literature survey of more than three decades of published research reveals that enterprise strategy has stayed firmly in the shadows behind business and corporate strategy.

The model development was informed by Pierre Bourdieu's relational theory of power and practice, and by Norbert Elias' and Michel Foucault's theories of power and knowledge. The model suggests that CSR, CS, and ethics are parts of the same organizational subsystem, shaped by a complex interaction between human capital, individual moral development, habitus (mindsets, dispositions), organizational practices and culture, and external situational factors. The generative mechanism, or motor, driving the development and change of organizational culture, consists of power relationships that are shaped by specific figurations of various types of human capital (social, cultural, economic, and symbolic).

Using a sample of 10,363 firm-year observations from the Chinese stock market for the period of 2001-2010, I provide strong and robust evidence that religion (i.e., Buddhism and Taoism on the whole) is significantly negatively associated with owner-manager agency costs. In particular, using firm-level religion data measured by the number of religious sites within a radius of certain distance around a listed firm's registered address, I find that religion is significantly negatively (positively) associated with expense ratio (asset utilization ratio), the positive (reverse) proxy for owner-manager agency costs. This finding is consistent with the following view: religiosity has remarkable effects on the way how an individual thinks and behaves, and thereof can curb managers from unethical business practices. Moreover, my findings suggest that the negative association between religion and owner-manager agency costs is attenuated for firms with strong external monitoring mechanisms such as higher Marketization and high-quality auditors. Furthermore, after separating Buddhism from Taoism, my finding indicates that above conclusions are only available for Buddhism, suggesting that different religions may have asymmetric influence on owner-manager agency costs.

To engage students' affect, research suggests the use of multiple teaching modalities (e.g., films, case studies, journals, and role-play) (McPhail, 2001). To develop students' ethical intellect, research recommends using appropriate, individual-specific cognitive stimulation (Massey and Thorne, 2006). Yet, in designing courses, faculty typically preselect course teaching methods independently of the particular students who enroll in the course, often teaching their courses using methods that are consistent with their own personal learning styles (Thompson, 1997) even though those methods may not be effective for (m)any students in their classes. Nonetheless, investigating each student's preferred learning style and tailoring the course accordingly is impractical (cf., Montgomery and Groat, 1988). Thus, as highlighted in the ethics literature (McPhail, 2001) and suggested in the education literature (Nilson, 2010a), faculty should utilize a variety of approaches to effectively teach ethics to their accounting students. To facilitate these efforts, this paper presents and evaluates various strategies accounting faculty can use to teach accounting ethics in ways that correspond to students' varying learning preferences. As such, the strategies this paper provides can be used to create an accounting ethics course that affectively impacts and cognitively stimulates a diverse student body that, in turn, can lead to improved ethical reasoning skills.

To study the effect of experience and social relationships on customer retention, we analyze a reality-mined co-presence network of health club members over a period of 4 years. Since central customers in the network have more social ties they will lose if they defect, we use centrality as a proxy for customer relationship switching costs. We find that long-standing customers do have a lower chance of renewing their contracts. However, in line with theoretical predictions (Burnham et al., Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 31(2):109-126, 2003), the consumer's centrality in the network (reflecting a social cost of defection) reduces customer churn rate.

This is especially relevant to international trade where goods manufactured in least developed countries (LDCs) are being exported to developed countries (DCs) via international supply chains. This book looks at Bangladesh's ready-made garments (RMG) industry - The seventh largest in the world - Facing demands for environmental and social management according to standards set by consumers in environmentally progressive societies. Apart from these concerns not having found cultural or institutional resonance in Bangladesh, the pressures for cost reduction, on-time delivery and cheap labour in a highly competitive international market make the problem that much more complex. In this book Selim uses the analytical framework provided by the ecological modernisation theory to examine the economic, communicative and social political aspects of ethical trade, and argues that the economy-ecology relationship can indeed be a positive sum game if nation-states and economic actors change their policymaking styles and greening behaviour to take advantage of scientific evidence and green technological opportunities. © 2011 Shahpar Selim.

ILOPS set out to establish an innovative template for multi-stakeholder, multinational participatory evaluation (PE) and examine the fundamental roles, relationships and evidence that underpin the national-, state- and district-level implementation of primary education policy and practice. To achieve these goals, ILOPS brought together national-level education leaders from each country to design and implement a strategy to explore and challenge the current evidence on parental participation and teacher quality. This paper highlights how ILOPS established an organizational infrastructure to support our national-level PE strategy, secured stakeholder participation and developed an innovative design to engage stakeholders. We report participant perspectives on how their ILOPS experience influenced the development of new knowledge, built professional capacity and enhanced social networks. In conclusion, we set forth a brief set of recommendations associated with employing participatory methods within and between national-level stakeholder teams. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Multi-site evaluation; National-level stakeholder; Parental participation; Participatory evaluation; Teacher quality",

Our primary aim is to enhance understanding of agentic strategies that facilitate transcending systemic complexities in sustainability leadership. We make a distinction in our analytical approach by drawing from Emirbayer and Mische's (Am J Sociol 103:41, 1998) conceptualisation of agency as 'an interactive process of reflexive transformation and relational pragmatics, a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past, oriented towards the future and enacted in the present' (p. 963). We add ontological sources of agency to these dynamics which interact with habit, imagination, judgement and learning in the transformation of social systems. This approach underpins our model 'Dynamic Interactions of Agency in Leadership' (DIAL), an integrative framework for analysing agency in sustainability leadership. We examine the efficacy of our framework in higher education initiatives in which sustainability aspirations, aims and actions are envisioned, articulated and mobilised. We conclude by offering further avenues of research in sustainability leadership designed to advance this burgeoning field and contribute to bridging the gap between sustainability challenges and our abilities to solve them. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agency; Environmental; Ethics; Leadership; Ontology; Sustainability",

Can we quantify engagement both at node level as well as at graph level? Typically, engagement refers to the degree that an individual participates (or is encouraged to participate) in a community and is closely related to the important property of nodes' departure dynamics, i.e., the tendency of individuals to leave the community. In this paper, we build upon recent work in the field of game theory, where the behavior of individuals (nodes) is modeled by a technology adoption game. That is, the decision of a node to remain engaged in the graph is affected by the decision of its neighbors, and the ""best practice"" for each individual is captured by its core number - as arises from the k-core decomposition. After modeling and defining the engagement dynamics at node and graph level, we examine whether they depend on structural and topolog-ical features of the graph. We perform experiments on a multitude of real graphs, observing interesting connections with other graph characteristics, as well as a clear deviation from the corresponding behavior of random graphs. Furthermore, similar to the well known results about the robustness of real graphs under random and targeted node removals, we discuss the implications of our findings on a special case of robustness - regarding random and targeted node departures based on their engagement level.

Two contemporary approaches for user-influencing design, ""Persuasive Technology"" and ""Nudge,"" are discussed against the background of social engagement in the history of design. What can be learned from the past? The most explicit but also contested examples of improving people's lives by means of design can be found in movements of ""utopian design."" We discuss the utopian aspirations in Arts and Crafts, New Objectivity, Gute Form, and Postmodernism. The major lesson to be learned is that it is necessary to find a way out of the repeated ethical dilemma between coercing human behavior on the one hand and fostering human freedom on the other. Following Michel Foucault, we will conceptualize freedom not as the absence of influences on people, but as a practice of shaping one's life in interaction with these influences. User-influencing design methods can help to prolong the tradition of socially engaged design, with tempered, non-utopian goals, but at the same time with improved understanding and more effective tools concerning how technology mediates our existence. © 2013 Dorrestijn & Verbeek.","Design for wellbeing; Ethics; Freedom; Nudge; Persuasive technology; User-influencing technology; Utopian design",

Focusing on customers' happiness is a value proposition of the latter kind. Yet, implementing such an approach requires that designers and marketers have a common understanding of the product's value proposition, and work together to create authentic value propositions about happiness that will also be compelling in the marketplace. In this article, we draw upon the positive psychology literature and present three propositions of design for happiness that designers and marketers can use to communicate and create value together. Design for happiness means designing business concepts with the aim of building and supporting long-term consumer happiness. The three propositions that we bring forward are: 1) design for fostering social relationships and belongingness, 2) design for meaning in life, and 3) design for making consumers active participants rather than passive observers.

The purpose of the paper is to explore the characteristics, motivations, values and expectations of Finnish hunting tourists, and to try to distinguish between different types among them. Design/methodology/approach: Twelve semi-structured, narrative, face-to-face interviews were conducted. The study was conceived within an interpretive paradigm, in which a central aim is to understand the subjective world of the human experience. Constant comparison was used as a method of data analysis. Findings: Several common features were distinguished among the interviewees. First, hunters' attitudes towards shooting and the importance of a bag have changed during the years. Second, a difference between an ordinary hunting experience and a hunting tourism experience was perceptible. Third, willingness to experience something new related to hunting was the most important hunting tourism motivation. The fourth common feature was the importance of the social component hunting tourism. Three different types of hunting tourists could be identified: responsible hunting tourists, adaptable hunting tourists and achievement-oriented hunting tourists. The major distinguishing factors were the hunters' attitudes towards shooting, game farming and social relationships during the hunting trip.

GWL's role in Wurundi includes creating the hard and soft infrastructure needed to move natural gas around the country. While all the key stakeholders (management of GWL, management of PIWI, etc.) agree that PIWI has successfully completed the gas transportation network code project and that all the work done by PIWI and its consultants has been truly world-class, GWL has not yet paid PIWI for its work. Earlier today, a senior executive at GWL (his name is Mr. Jonas Adorande) indicated to Adams that before he (that is, Adorande) signs off on the project (one of the required steps in GWL's payment process), Adams will need to give him (in unmarked bank notes) approximately $50,000. Additional data and information in the case include:. 1. Regarding the project: an explanation of what a gas transportation network code is, and why a country having natural gas needs one. 2. Regarding the company (PIWI): Because PIWI has in the past operated extremely successfully in a very challenging developing world market (that is, Wurundi), information is provided on PIWI's business model plus the company's past and current performance and factors impacting that performance over the years. 3.

Given the fact that the relationship between sustainability and project management is still an emerging field of study, these approaches make sense. However, they do not diminish the need for more empirical studies to understand how the concepts of sustainable development are implemented in practice. This chapter reports an analysis of 56 case studies on the integration of the concepts of sustainability in the way organizations initiate, develop, and manage projects. The research question of the study was: To what extent do organizations consider the concepts of sustainability in the initiation, development, and management of projects? The study found an overall average level of sustainability consideration in the actual situation of 25.9%. For the desired situation, this score is almost 10 percent higher, showing an ambition to take sustainability more into consideration. The study also showed that the way sustainability currently is considered in projects should be categorized as the traditional ""making things less bad"" approach to sustainability integration and not as a more modern ""how can we contribute to making things good"" approach.

It seems we lost our way when the news became big business in the 80s and 90s."" In order to address industry-wide declining viewership, and ""corporate's"" push for profits, Walter established a strategy team to plan a direction for the news division. The team discussed two primary options: charge other LRV SBUs (Strategic Business Units) for positive ""news"" coverage of their operations, in essence covert advertising; and outsourcing of the news. In the former case, the team is faced the issue of how ZBN should cover a story about a LRV power plant which is dumping a highly deadly poison into a rural watershed.

Project SD strategy is the missing link between SD at the corporate level and project level. The framework draws on a literature review of concepts, definitions, and theories in strategic management, corporate sustainability, and projects. The conceptual framework presented in this book chapter has six key components. These are: (1) corporate sustainability strategy; (2) project understanding of SD and SD business case; (3) strategizing at project initiation stage; (4) project autonomy to negotiate and adapt in the project context; (5) project capability to translate corporate SD strategy to project SD strategy; and (6) project capability in stakeholder management. The premise of the framework is the compatibility of the socially constructed realities of the project and SD, as indicated in SD and project literature. The aim is to help develop new knowledge and insight into how business can integrate SD principles into core business operations such as projects from a process perspective, rather than sustainability content perspective.

Data quality issues trigger rework, which makes it difficult to accurately schedule deliverables. Two things can bring improvement. Firstly, one should deliver information products in the smallest possible chunks, but without adding prohibitive overhead for breaking up the work in tiny increments. This will increase the frequency and improve timeliness of feedback on suitability of information products and hence make planning and progress more predictable. Secondly, BI teams need to provide better stewardship when they facilitate discussions between departments whose data cannot easily be integrated. Many so-called data quality errors do not stem from inaccurate source data, but rather from incorrect interpretation of data. This is mostly caused by different interpretation of essentially the same underlying source system facts across departments with misaligned performance objectives. Such problems require prudent stakeholder management and informed negotiations to resolve such differences. In this chapter, the authors suggest an innovation to data warehouse architecture to help accomplish these objectives. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",,
