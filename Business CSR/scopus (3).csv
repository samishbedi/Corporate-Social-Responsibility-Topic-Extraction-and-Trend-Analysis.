Drawing on a conceptual framework of 'collaborative betterment' and 'collaborative empowerment' and by using focus group discussions and interviews, it assesses the initiative to examine the extent to which it meets expectations of the community where it operates. Some of the key findings of the paper include: (i) although the initiative provides vital healthcare services to some of the most vulnerable and desperately poor communities, the level of actual engagement of the local people - the main stakeholders - has been marginal; (ii) when the principles of collaborative betterment and empowerment are considered, it can be concluded that the initiative struggles even as a 'betterment' process; and (iii) notwithstanding the rhetoric and high-blown statements, corporate role in terms of practical efforts in the field has been mostly superficial and limited. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Bangladesh; Collaborative betterment and empowerment; Corporate community involvement (CCI); Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Stakeholder engagement",

Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with various corporate social responsibility (CSR) or CCI managers from Australian companies and their not-for-profit (NFP) partners. The final sample consists of 27 managers from a mix of industries. Findings - The study shows that stakeholder's salience may have an impact on CCI activities, especially in the area of measurements and reporting activities. Moreover, while some companies have attempted to measure the social impact of their initiatives, a large number of companies have not. This is all the more surprising given the recent focus in marketing on accountability and measurement. The results show three challenges: lack of interest, lack of resources and lack of consensus. Subsequently, the authors offer some research propositions to underline these challenges. Originality/value - This study focuses on CCI which is one of the most visible parts of corporate social responsibility (CSR). It draws on interviews with various managers in charge of companies' CSR or CCI. Copyright © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study was to explore the implementation process of a professional sport team's CCI using program evaluation theory (Chen, 2005). Interviews were conducted with 42 key stakeholders (team executives, partnership implementers, participants, parents, coaches) from one Major League Baseball team's CCI to understand critical processes involved in CCI implementation and execution. The findings showed concerns in the quality of program implementation with the: 1) the partnership agreement, 2) the ecological context, 3) protocol and implementation, and 4) target population. We propose an iterative model of program evaluation for use in the sport context. We conclude the paper with recommendations for further research in this area and implications for practitioners. © 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Corporate community involvement initiative; Implementation; Process management; Professional sport; Social initiatives; Social responsibility; Strategies",

This article examines the common CFP-CSP understanding in three distinct ways: (1) by extending the evaluation of CSP as a complex, multistakeholder notion; (2) by analyzing CSP's relationship with the firm's financial performance at a given point in time as a lead (independent) variable in the relationship and as a lag (dependent) variable in the relationship; and (3) for both positive and negative stakeholder relationships. The results indicate that the employee emerges as the stakeholder group most strongly linked to CFP, followed by the consumer stakeholder. The natural environment and the community stakeholder group are minimally associated with CFP. General support is found for a CFP-CSP relationship at a given point in time, with some support found for CSP as a lead (independent) variable. When used as a measure of financial performance, return on assets is more often correlated with CSP than is return on equity. These results and their implications are discussed. © 2014 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Existing empirical work focuses exclusively on the incentive effect. In contrast, in this paper we explore the sorting effect of firm CSP on the initial compensation of newly hired executives. In doing so, we develop a novel theoretical approach based on an integration of stakeholder theory and human capital theory, suggesting a positive association between the initial compensation of executives and firm CSP strengths and concerns. It also suggests that the strength of this relationship varies between different executive roles (as a function of stakeholder- management responsibilities).

A review of the extensive literature in this field reveals that the conceptualisation of corporate approaches to responsible stakeholder management remains underdeveloped. In particular, CSR practices within the specific context of the pharmaceutical industry, a sector which particularly dramatically depicts the stakeholder management dilemmas faced by business managers, has been under-researched. To address this gap, this paper utilises qualitative, exploratory data, obtained via multiple research methods, to investigate the CSR practices of major pharmaceutical companies in the UK and Germany. The data are employed to critically re-examine and revise a previously published explanatory framework which identifies the management steps involved in CSR stakeholder engagement. The resulting revised explanatory framework is the main contribution of this paper. By abstracting those factors which influence CSR practice, it provides an analytical tool which is designed to be of practical use for business decision-makers when managing their stakeholder engagement activities. Given that the research addresses values and ideals and prescribes practical recommendations for practitioners, it is essentially applied and normative in nature. Ultimately, the framework proposes a set of steps for developing CSR strategies which could help CSR professionals to make a ‘mindset transition’ from a narrower ‘traditional’ approach to CSR to a more innovative way of thinking. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Conceptual frameworks; CSR; Pharmaceutical industry; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder management; UK and Germany",

The most recent report, King III, views stakeholder relationship management as a key tenet of corporate governance. This raises the question whether public relations professionals (PRPs) understand the principles of corporate governance well-enough to inform and guide organizations on the management of stakeholder relationships. The views of senior PRPs at selected top performing companies were elicited on their practice of stakeholder relationship management in line with corporate governance principles. It was found that their knowledge on corporate governance was limited, although they recognized its importance. They propose six role functions for managing stakeholder relationships on a strategic or managerial level; these role functions are aligned with the King III principles on stakeholder relationships. The following three were of particular importance: developing a corporate strategy, giving advice to senior management and managing crisis communication. Different terminologies were used to build relations with stakeholders and different approaches were used to profile stakeholders. It is recommended that organizations leverage their public relations functions on strategic and managerial levels in support of their corporate governance efforts. In turn, PRPs are encouraged to ensure a deep knowledge on corporate governance issues when counseling senior management on building stakeholder relationships. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate governance; Governing stakeholder relationships (GSR); Public relations; Stakeholder engagement (SE); Stakeholder relationship management (SRM)",

Thus, stakeholders' judgments of corporate social responsibility (CSR) typically evaluate positives in the context of negatives, and vice versa.

The significance of stakeholder engagement and interpretation of evolving designs is emphasized by empirical evidence drawn from a research study into hospital construction project briefing and design practices. The paper reflects that whilst both the NHS client and hospital design teams attempt to ""engage"" and ""understand"" stakeholders, stakeholders have the capacity to interpret designs with their own cognitive understandings. The semiotic theories of Roland Barthes and Umberto Eco concerning the role of author and reader of signs and lexicons of knowledge provide a supportive analytical framework for the insights of the paper. It is noted that whilst the constitution of the client and the parameters of a project affect stakeholder management practices, the role of evolving design artefacts and stakeholder engagement and interpretation of them should be recognised. Stakeholders relate to a project via the artefacts of design, interpreting issues against personal individual understandings that may be different to those of construction professionals or externally appointed project advisors. The paper makes the case for more inclusive participatory design initiatives to embrace diverse and insightful stakeholder opinions and interpretations.","Briefing; Hospitals; Semiotics; Stakeholders","Hospitals; Project management; Semiotics; Briefing; Briefing process; Construction professionals; Construction projects; Participatory design; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder management; Stakeholders; Design"

In this research we examine the impact of internationalization on corporate social performance. Using a sample of 102 U.S. firms from the chemical, energy and industrial machinery industries, our results show that not all the dimensions of internationalization lead firms to enhance their level of social performance. Specifically, we can see that, whereas percentage of sales in foreign markets and cultural international diversification help firms to improve their level of social performance (complying with the different stakeholders' social needs in each country where they operate), geographical international diversification is not related to corporate social performance. Thus, the number of geographical areas is not an important issue, but the degree of cultural international diversification between these areas what really influences firms' corporate social performance. We discuss important implications for academia, managers and policy-makers as well.","Chemical industry; Energetic industry; Geographical and cultural international diversification; Industrial machinery industry; Panel data analysis; U.S. firms",

In this paper, we propose measuring CSP via the construct of stakeholder satisfaction through social media. Using organizational justice theory, we argue that the satisfaction of stakeholder expectations can be understood partly through the perception of unjust corporate behavior, which is then expressed by stakeholders through social media. The explosion of social networking and microblogging has made it possible for people to express opinions with respect to the economic, social, and environmental events for all sorts of firms. We test these ideas using event study methods with a sample of 5,440 observations from ten firms. We find preliminary evidence of the sensitivity of social media to these events.","Corporate social performance; Event study; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Stakeholder",

CSP exemplifies how corporate social responsibility translates into an organization's practice by focusing on three key features of performance: principles, processes and outcomes. However, the development of the model has not kept pace with the literature on social and environmental responsibility. This study builds on an argument that if corporate social responsibility in general - in which CSP plays an important role - is to respond to the challenges of sustainable development, the CSP of businesses could be more profoundly planned in order to design knowledge outcomes that contribute to meeting those challenges. The paper thus answers the recent call for the development of a CSP model by revising some of the key elements in the existing model and also by adding a knowledge creation dimension. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Corporate social performance (CSP); Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Knowledge creation; Knowledge management; Private knowledge; Public knowledge; Sustainable development","corporate strategy; environmental economics; knowledge; management practice; organizational framework; performance assessment; social development; sustainable development"

However, mainstream HPWS research has paid little attention to employees' perceptions of HPWS, or to the relationship between HPWS and corporate social performance (CSP). The influence of CSP on employee outcomes such as organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) has thus been similarly neglected. This paper seeks to investigate these missing links in literature using data collected from a sample of 700 employees in China. The findings demonstrate that HPWS is positively related to HPWS satisfaction and employees' perceptions of CSP. HPWS satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between HPWS and employees' affective commitment (AC). There are multiple mediators between HPWS and OCB, indicating more complicated mechanisms through which HPWS leads to desired HR outcomes. Employees' perceived CSP has a significant influence on HPWS satisfaction, AC and OCB, suggesting firms should place a premium on achieving a reputation as being socially responsible. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","China; Corporate social performance; Employee outcomes; HPWS; HPWS satisfaction",

Using data of listed companies in China, this paper examines whether CSR behavior in the form of charitable donations garners a positive reaction from suppliers.

The results are robust to various measures of CSP and endogeneity tests. The results support the strategic philanthropy view and apply stakeholder theory in supply chain, that strategic CSR can help firms to attract suppliers and consolidate cooperative relationships with them, which in turn benefits the firms in terms of more trade credit financing from suppliers. This paper also shows that state-owned enterprises and non-SOEs have different CSR intentions and use CSR to achieve strategic goals in different ways. The conclusions drawn from this study provide practical guidance on CSR strategy, suggesting that CSR activities can help a firm in transition economies to enhance its corporate image, establish and consolidate the good relationship with suppliers, and obtain economic benefits or achieve long-term business objectives. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Stakeholders; Suppliers; Trade credit",

We find that the value of CSP as insurance against litigation risk is practically significant, adding 2 to 4 percent to firm value.

The analysis shows that SD intensity is closely linked to the quality of social reports. Some categories, such as corporate identity, membership and community, exhibit high levels of disclosure whilst for other categories, like the environment, there is a lack of a coherent and unitary plan. Moreover, the degree of SD intensity does not appear to be completely represented into actual social-environmental performance and this confirms the shortcomings of the use of SD as a proxy for Corporate Social Performance.",,

As such, very few studies have focused on the micro (individual) level of analysis.

Moreover, the study is one of the first examining the role of context in employee attitudes toward CSR. In particular, it builds on the psychology of CSR (e.g. Rupp et al. 2013) literature to propose a research framework that delineates the moderating effects of satisfaction with payment, satisfaction with the job itself and individualism in the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) perceptions and customer-facing employees' behavioral outcomes. Data are collected from customer-facing employees in two major organizations in the Netherlands and India. Results suggest a complex interplay between CSP perceptions and the two facets of job satisfaction, and that national context is likely to moderate the contingent effects of CSP perceptions on customer-facing employees' behavioral outcomes. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","corporate social performance; corporate social responsibility; cross-national; customer-facing employees; job satisfaction; salespeople",

Using the context of sustainability, case study research demonstrated that 'stakeholder involvement' (how stakeholders become active or inactive) is a complex process influenced by a range of interlinked personal and externally driven factors. Principally, the process is influenced by the type of leadership (leadership quality) and the capability of stakeholders to become involved (stakeholder involvement capacity). These two forces play a significant role in stakeholder involvement and constitute the main part of the 'Leadership-Stakeholder Involvement Capacity' (LSIC) nexus that is presented in this paper.

The present article seeks to complement this novel approach to understanding stakeholder management by adding insights from the multilevel influences that create the corporate culture in the first place, and ultimately affect managers in their stakeholder decisions. This article draws on cultural theory to examine how the individuals who compose firms present group and grid solidarity that results in cultural biases in the corporate culture. These cultural biases-individualism, hierarchy, fatalism, and egalitarianism-are then paired with the stakeholder cultures they enable, and inferences are extracted concerning the salience managers are likely to accord to various classes of stakeholders as a result.

In this paper, we focus on the individual level of CSP, manifested in the managerial discretion of a firm's principles, processes, and policies regarding social responsibilities. Specifically, we address the human resources management of employees as a way of promoting CSR values and producing socially minded outcomes. We show that applying the humanist philosophy to the managerial discretion of a business organization leads to the creation of an ""autonomy supportive work environment""-as defined by the self-determination theory-which in turn, facilitates the internalization of social values, citizenship behaviors, and cooperation. The objective of promoting self-determination at work (i.e., the core of a humanist management) fits well with the ontology of social responsibility since autonomy and consideration of individuals as moral actors are central tenets. Furthermore, we show that applying humanistic management philosophy to the discretion of managers can lead to socially responsible outcomes. First, intra-organizational stakeholders (e.g., employees) are treated with respect and focus is put on their well-being, satisfaction, and self-actualization at work. Second, as employees' need of self-determination is addressed by managers, it is likely that pro-social behaviors toward other stakeholders of the organization will be adopted, leading to socially responsible outcomes for extra-organizational stakeholders (Gagné, Motiv Emot 77:58-75, 2003). Thus, this paper ultimately posits that humanistic management applied to the HRM can be a solution for developing and maintaining socially responsible outcomes as determined at the individual level of the CSP model, through managerial discretion. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; HRM; Humanist philosophy; Managerial discretion; Self-determination",

In response, some leading companies have begun to publish integrated reporting, in the form of a document providing a coherent summary of this information, thus facilitating stakeholder engagement. This paper examines the validity of the hypotheses of the theories of agency and of signalling, and analyses the political costs and those borne by owners in voluntarily developing this new type of business document. More specifically, in order to determine their prevalence among the suggested reasons for these paradigms, we analyse the effect of industry concentration, together with other factors, in the development of integrated reporting. The analysis of a non-balanced sample of 1590 international companies for the years 2008-2010, in which a logistic regression methodology is applied to panel data, reveals the negative impact of industry concentration on the development of a more pluralist report, simultaneously taking into account stakeholders, sustainability and the long-term viewpoint, as well as questions of responsible investment, business ethics and transparency.

The authors argue that sustainability challenges should be addressed simultaneously at the individual, organizational, sectorial, national and supranational level. Financial institutions have a systemic impact on the economy, and on the functioning of our societies. Therefore, a culture of profit maximization and unbridled risk-taking, notwithstanding the external costs and impacts, contaminates not only the financial system and the economy, but also individual norms of responsibility. In this line of reasoning, the global financial crisis revealed the destabilizing effects on the economy, society and corporations and forms a serious impediment for sustainable business. This is a huge challenge for sustainability business and corporate governance; however, it is an illusion to think that managers can prevent scandals and moral norm deterioration without support from other social players.Design/methodology/approach – This paper offers a conceptual analysis on the past financial crisis (2008-2012). It questions the focus on sustainability at the corporate level, and suggests a more comprehensive method for governance. The authors argue in favour of sustainability implementation, combining different governance levels.Findings – The double-dip financial crisis 2008-2012 showed the failure of an unsustainable global system. It becomes clear that corporate responsibility and corporate governance are limited in their contribution to sustainable business in a sustainable economy. Hence, it is important to have a more integrated approach to address sustainability risks, with a solution at individual, sectorial, national and supranational governance levels.Research limitations/implications – This contribution advances five different levels of governance to mitigate risks for sustainable business, arguing in favour of integrated governance for sustainability risks. However, an empirical validation of these ideas still needs to be developed. Future empirical research is needed to validate the five levels of governance. Future research is also needed to better grasp the mechanisms in support of governance.Practical implications – Corporate responsibility and corporate governance are necessary but not sufficient conditions to address the sustainability risks one faces. All actors in the economy recognize that governance for sustainable business in a sustainable economy is a collaborative effort for which neither legislative nor institutional or behavioural norms are developed in an integrated way. They should also recognize that integrated governance is not only imperative for the common good, but also in the direct interest of shareholders and other stakeholders.Originality/value – This paper contributes to the literature on corporate responsibility and corporate governance with the identification of specific roles for regulators, sector representatives and individuals, which are complementary to the role of the companies in creating the conditions for sustainable business in a sustainable economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Corporate responsibility; Global governance; Risk management; Sustainability",

South African-listed companies are among the first in the world to be subject to compliance with IR requirements in terms of stock exchange listing requirements. IR, as a novel and evolutionary step in corporate reporting, along with the influence that integrated thinking and IR principles will have on companies, has been the subject of global debate in recent years.Design/methodology/approach - The research instrument used in the study comprised a self-administered Web-based survey aimed at CEOs and CFOs of all South African listed companies. The survey was validated by a pre-trail and data analysed by a statistician to ensure reliability.Findings - The study revealed that listed companies, in a mandated regulatory regime implemented in a short period with reference to a highly prescriptive draft framework, attach value to the IR process primarily from the perspective of their corporate reputation, investor needs and stakeholder engagement and relations. This strengthens the business case for voluntary IR as a reporting regime. Advancement of corporate reputation appears to be a key motive to compile an integrated report, secondary to compliance as a primary motive. This indicates the perceived corporate legitimising effect of producing an integrated report. Furthermore, managers are more motivated by the legitimising aspect of advancing corporate reputation and stakeholder needs in compiling the integrated report than satisfying investor needs. This results in a disconnect between the perceived audience of the report by managers and the intended audience of the report as providers of capital as envisioned by the IIRC, which should be a matter for future consideration. Better resource allocation decisions and cost reductions are not indicated as an outcome of IR in the study. Furthermore, substantial changes to management information systems, with associated costs, would be required by companies to satisfy the requirements of the report content. The study revealed that the anticipated benefit of a company reconsidering its business model and encouraging sustainable product development is not perceived to be a material outcome in companies that implement IR, nor is assessing economic value creation and strategy considered a key motive for companies to compile an integrated report.Research limitations/implications - Further validation of the survey by statistical methods in addition to the pre-trial of the survey was not considered viable by the statistician in view of the limited amount of data. This may be viewed as a potential limitation of the study. Statistical analysis must also be interpreted with caution given the limited amount of data available for analysis. Other limitations include the fact that certain industries are too heavily represented instead of there being a mix of industries representing the entire market listed on the JSE, and that a substantial proportion of thecompanies are large listed companies and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Constituents. As a result, the results may not be representative of the overall market listed on the JSE.Practical implications - Managers are more motivated by the legitimising aspect of advancing corporate reputation and stakeholder needs in compiling the integrated report than satisfying investor needs, while the intended audience of the report in the framework is the providers of financial capital. This needs to be considered in the future development of regulations and frameworks. Furthermore, policymakers and regulators should exercise caution in the early stages of IR, when there is still a lack of evidence to support significant short-term changes in reconsidering the business model as well as sustainable product development that could be convincingly attributed to mandatory IR. It is, therefore, critical that policymakers, government and regulators strive towards creating a wider enabling environment to advance sustainable product development and sustainable business models. This can include establishing incentives to encourage the development of sustainable products, or other incentives that serve to align business objectives with national and global objectives and frameworks. Industry bodies can play a significant role in developing universal industry standards in this regard. Consideration should further be given to implementing regulatory mechanisms for advancing and possibly enforcing responsible investment practices as a measure to fully engage business in the critical shift towards sustainable business practices.Originality/value - The study is significant from a global perspective because IR and integrated thinking form a new and globally developing concept and the potential benefits and expected outcomes from an organisational perspective thereof for companies are currently the subject of continued global debate. This study aims to provide valuable insights into and understanding of the perceived organisational benefits of implementing IR requirements, as well as serves to highlight the challenge areas experienced in South African companies by compliance with IR requirements. The study also contributes towards the debate of motives of managers for producing an integrated report and how this will affect future directions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Benefits of integrated reporting; Integrated reporting; Integrated thinking; Motives for corporate reporting and disclosures; Sustainable business practices; Sustainable capitalism",

A semiotic analysis of briefing communications between client stakeholders and designers provides evidence of the significance and importance of stakeholder interpretation and understanding of design, empirical data being drawn from a qualitative study of NHS hospital construction projects in the UK. It is contended that stakeholders engage with a project through communicative signs and artefacts of design, referencing personal cognitive knowledge in acts of interpretation that may be different from those of designers and externally appointed client advisers. Such interpretations occur in addition to NHS client and design team efforts to 'engage' with and 'understand' stakeholders using a variety of methods. Social semiotic theorizations indicate how narrative strategies motivate the formulation of signs and artefacts in briefing work, the role of sign authors and sign readers being elucidated as a result. Findings are contextualized against current understandings of briefing communications and stakeholder management practices, a more socially attuned understanding of breifing countering some of the process-led improvement models that have characterized much of the post-Egan report literature.

Few research works in the CSP empirical literature have studied the relationship between stakeholder power and CSP. Design/methodology/approach – Stakeholder theory is used as a theoretical framework to explain how shareholder voting power can influence the CSP level of French publicly listed companies. Stakeholder theory is tested through the operationalization of Ullmann’s (1985) three-dimensional model. Hypotheses related to shareholder voting power, strategic posture and financial performance are formulated through a literature review. A Data Envelopment Analysis approach was presented as a strong tool to measure CSP level. Multiple linear regressions were undertaken to test the hypotheses in a sample of 129 French companies between 2006 and 2007. Findings – The results indicate that companies with dispersed ownership and high proportion of institutional shareholders record a high score of CSP. Strategic posture measured by the implementation of environmental certification standard was positively and significantly related to CSP. Financial performance does not affect significantly the level of CSP.

However, there still is a general lack of a strategicunderstanding of how corporate citizenship development occurs. The potential of OD frameworks and tools for developing corporate citizenship have been highlighted.

This work sought to determine the nature and strength of relationships between business ethics, business's code for social management, and investment in the community dimensions of CSR and its environmental governance dimension. The entire system of hypothesized direct and indirect relationships among the four variables was modeled using structural equations modeling on IBM® SPSS® AMOS. Several path analyses were tested using maximum likelihood estimations of the parameters in the model. Hypothesis testing was conducted on the entire system of equations and on each coefficient. The results show that investment in the community and the code for social management in the business, have direct positive effects on the environmental governance rating.

In addition to corporate social actions toward technical stakeholders are viewed as self-serving actions and are therefore less likely to impact on CR. Practical implications: The research can be very useful for business managers since it provides theoretical discussion and empirical proof about the effect of social actions on CR, which can assist them in designing or modifying social responsibility strategies used by the firm in order to build a positive CR. Originality/value: The paper develops a framework on CR, highlighting the valuable roles that different types of social actions play in reputation building, and proposes a new model that identifies the impact of different types of social actions on organizational reputation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social actions; Corporate social performance; Institutional stakeholders; Organizational reputation; Technical stakeholders",

Using multiple regression models and data from a sample of 69 Australian public companies, this paper finds a positive correlation between GHG emissions and corporate financial performance. By testing the statistical significance of GHG emission factors in determining company Tobin's q, this study finds that a stronger Tobin's q often correlates with higher GHG emissions across all industry sectors. This finding is contrary to evidence found in previous studies conducted in other countries.

As the country's remarkable and peaceful transition to democracy unfolds, millions, both urban and rural, are still confronted with having to survive unemployment, homelessness, lack of basic services, HIV/Aids, food insecurity and unacceptable levels of crime and violence. Confronted by the complexity of our development challenges, one of our biggest failures is a lack of communication, trust, common purpose, collaborative leadership and sustainable relationships between the various sectors and stakeholders in development. Transforming South Africa's society to remove the legacy of marginalization will be a long-term process requiring the sustained commitment of the leaders and people of the nation's diverse groups. So the question remains: how can non-profit organizations (NPOs) establish themselves as development providers within the uncertain political arena, of which South Africa is characteristic, in order to represent all the masses who cannot speak for themselves and more than often find themselves in a marginalized and stigmatized position? Principle results: Some Non-profit organizations recognize that their relationships with stakeholders is of great importance for their survival, various forms of communication take place without the necessary planning and without clear objectives for the development of these relationships. NPOs need a positive image and reputation due to financial implications where they do not have sufficient funds to support or market themselves effectively. In this climate of polarization NPOs play a pivotal role in providing a voice to the poor, mobilizing a motion of change and creating a platform for relationships, credibility and trust. Within the theoretical framework of relationship management theory, the interests of all stakeholders are balanced through the management of the stakeholder relationships. Major conclusions: Non-profit organizations need to ensure that they protect their stakeholders (especially those who are in desperate need of the services rendered by these organizations), deliver better services and although not operating for the purpose of making a profit, manage themselves so that they do generate profit which will enable them to support themselves especially when funding is something that is becoming a rare phenomenon. Although NPOs find themselves in difficult financial times they need to renovate and almost reinvent themselves, in order to be fully capable to address many social problems in SA and to indicate to those who support them (especially financially) that they are to be trusted, committed to make a difference, that they deliver on their promises and to ensure open communication channels with all their stakeholders. NPOs need to manage their reputations which are built on their corporate identities because it is the organization's reputation that often creates a lifeline in uncertain times. If the NPOs succeed in managing their identities effectively, it may serve as the foundation for developing and maintaining relationships with their respective stakeholders which in turn could change the face of South Africa's society. These organizations might go about creating a platform for dialog in an attempt to build sustainable productive relationships that can go about uplifting and empowering those who would otherwise not have such an opportunity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate identity; Non-profit organizations; Public relations; Relationship management; South-Africa; Stakeholder management",

Using a sample of 593 of the largest publicly traded companies in the world from 32 countries during 2007 to 2011, we find that in societies where shareholders enjoy a high degree of legal rights, the impact of stock market returns on corporate reputation becomes more positive. Likewise, the negative relationship between earnings volatility and reputation becomes greater when creditor rights are stronger.

We then conduct various statistical techniques (e.g., Pearson correlation analysis and ordinary least squares regression analysis) to study the relationships among social performance and family involvement. This paper is the first to provide a preliminary assessment of French family firms' CSR practices in the current economic context. The study suggests that family firms intensify their CSR efforts during the 2005-2011 period.

It sheds light on perspectives of how socially responsible business conduct is shaped by consultancies in a national business environment where such an essential aspect of organizational commitment and behavior exhibits comparatively little resonance among companies and is primarily induced by supranational and international policy schemes as well as foreign competitors. Drawing from long interviews with consulting professionals, we explore key topics: the domestic CSR (consulting) industry's characteristics, issues pertaining to the engagement with clients, the endorsement of CSR standards and initiatives, along with the consultants' perspective on institutional dynamics and their prospects with respect to the future of CSR in Greece. In this context, we aim to indicate trends on CSR implementation, pressures exerted on consultants, and managerial attitudes towards corporate responsibility. Our findings illustrate an oligopolistically structured market that encourages consultancies to compete intensely, the consultants' limited capacity to influence the business behavior of their clients, with the latter to adopt a promotional communicative approach to CSR, as well as a lack of institutional coordination and mechanisms that will materially embed social responsibility in the strategic management of business. © 2014 The Authors.

Our research evidence shows that the stakeholder relationship context moderates the role of corporate patriotism as a dimension of corporate reputation. The results further show significant differences in the role of national identity in organisation–stakeholder relationships. Specifically, corporate patriotism is more important for the reputation of a company as an employer and local citizen than as a provider of products and services.

To date, however, little academic research has investigated how knowledge of police performance impacts citizens' trust. We address this long-standing lacuna by exploring citizens' trust before and after exposure to real performance data in the context of a British police force. The results reveal that being informed of performance data affects citizens' trust significantly. Furthermore, direction and degree of change in trust are related to variations across the different elements of the reported performance criteria. Interestingly, the volatility of citizens' trust is related to initial performance perceptions (such that citizens with low initial perceptions of police performance react more significantly to evidence of both good and bad performance than citizens with high initial perceptions), and citizens' intentions to support the police do not always correlate with their cognitive and affective trust towards the police. In discussing our findings, we explore the implications of how being transparent with performance data can both hinder and be helpful in developing citizens' trust towards a public organisation such as the police.

Furthermore, the increase in awareness on environmental issues, sustainable development, corporate citizenship and the benefit of recycling had also placed more pressure on firms to adopt sustainable business initiatives such as a better reverse logistics strategy. Manufacturing firms however often focused on forward logistics and as a result, they tend to overlook at the importance of reverse logistics activities and its potential of improving the firm's performance. The objective of this study is to look at the current level of reverse logistics adoption among manufacturers in Malaysia and to identify the influence of customer/stakeholder pressure, regulatory pressure, financial and competitive pressure, and corporate citizenship pressure on the level of reverse logistics adoption. In addition, this study also aims to determine the relationship between reverse logistics adoption level and firm's performance. Data was collected through survey questionnaire, and the respondents consist of managers at manufacturing firms located in the Northern State of Malaysia and the Klang Valley. 101 samples were collected and data analysis was conducted using the Partial Least Square (PLS) regression analysis, through SmartPLS 2.0 software. Findings indicate that the level of reverse logistics adoption among Malaysia manufacturers is considerably low. Out of four independent variables, only the regulatory pressure has a significantly strong influence on the level of reverse logistics adoption, while customer and stakeholder pressure has a significant but moderate influence. No significant relationship was observed between the level of reverse logistics adoption and firm's performance.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental awareness; Logistics; Reverse logistics; Supply chain",

Sustainability concerns are concurrently becoming significant to business planning around corporate social responsibility and integral to organizational strategies toward enhancing shareholder value. The mindset of corporate managers is a key factor in determining company approaches to sustainability. But what do corporate managers understand by sustainability? Our study explores discursive meaning negotiation surrounding the concepts of environment and sustainability within business discourse. The study is based on qualitative interpretive research drawing from symbolic interactionism (Blumer, Symbolic interactionism: perspective and method. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1969) which postulates that meaning in discourse is an essentially contested domain dependent upon negotiation in the Habermasian tradition of mutually respectful dialogue (Habermas, The theory of communicative action: lifeworld and system: a critique of functionalist reason. Beacon Press, Boston 1987). Data from semi-structured intensive interviews of a small sample of senior corporate managers was analyzed to examine how corporate elites in India frame their approach to sustainability issues and respond to external pressures for deeper corporate responsibility. The findings point to the existence of a distinctively local narrative with strong potential for the discursive negotiation of personal and collective understanding of ethical and socio-cultural values that may help internalize broader sustainability considerations into corporate decision-making processes. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Discourse; Environment; Sustainability; Sustainable development",

More recently, the acceptance of new technologies has increasingly been influenced by secondary stakeholders, some of which are difficult to identify, or whose concerns are not easily reconciled. This paper develops a conceptual framework based on the management of technology and research & development literature, stakeholder theory, risk and social judgment to describe how traditional approaches based on reducing uncertainties through estimating probabilities may not work for social uncertainties; different heuristics are needed to understand and resolve such heterogeneous stakeholder perspectives. We contribute to the discourse by describing how risk perceptions among stakeholders vary, and how this may change over time. The framework suggests that the perception of primary stakeholder towards a specific innovation is 'Standard' when information is well known, but becomes riskier when information is unclear. For secondary stakeholders, when there is a low degree of imperfect information, the stakeholder relationship is an 'Irritant' but becomes increasingly 'Dangerous' when information becomes ambiguous.

We find that IFRS adoption had a differential effect on CSD based on a firm's institutional setting i.e., the stakeholder-management relationship prevalent in their institutional environment. Firms in the stakeholder countries did not have a significant change in the level of CSD following the mandatory adoption of IFRS while firms from the shareholder countries experienced a significant increase over the same period resulting in shareholder countries providing an overall higher level of CSD after IFRS adoption than stakeholder countries. These findings suggest that firms' reactions to the requirements of IFRS and the stakeholder pressure to provide additional CSD are influenced by institutional environment.

It takes the form of an in-depth case study of a Swedish mining and metals company and employs an analytical framework based on the ISO 26000 CSR standard. The company in question has wellintegrated and implemented work systems regarding both labor practices and the environment. This indicates that certified management systems are effective tools for CSR and can be used rather effectively as a means of stakeholder management in practice. However, analysis also shows that such management systems contribute neither to the use of more renewable energy resources nor to a systematic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Given that teleological perspective, the role of the business ethicist is to be an orator or rhetorician. Further, since one cannot expect more certitude than the subject warrants, from Aristotle's perspective, while rhetoric is the most persuasive means of arguing, it is not scientific demonstration. Rhetoric uses examples and enthymemes. Such an approach answers the postmodern claim that ethical argument cannot lead to certitude and shows how the use of rhetoric helps avoid relativism and leads to more effective persuasion. According to Aristotle, rhetoric involves gaining truth with a ""rough and general sketch."" This rhetorical approach allows the listener to ""see as"" the persuader sees, by attending to aspects of our shared experience and language.

With the decline of the modern welfare state since the late 1970s, social activities of business firms are increasingly regarded as an important complement to or even as a substitute for welfare state policies by a part of the literature. However, and controversially, another stream of argumentation regards these activities as being aimed at advancing the reach of market forces. To fully grasp the ambiguous nature of the social activities of business, in this paper I provide an account of affirmative as well as of critical interpretations of these activities throughout the history of modern capitalism. On this basis, the power of critique to disentangle the diverse motivations that underlie the social engagement of business is highlighted as a condition for facilitating a role of business in society that balances economic and social considerations. © 2014 The Author.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on insights gained from eight Norwegian companies in different industries. Purposeful sampling was employed to ensure that the companies had sustainable business models beyond the level of mere compliance, of sustainable business practices in the marketplace and society. A deductive approach to data collection ensured that the companies had sufficient understanding to relate their sustainable business practices to interviewers. The interviews were subsequently transcribed and analyzed systematically by the research team. Findings: The empirical findings indicate evolutionary changes as companies move on a continuum from superficial to embedded sustainable business models and the application of sustainable business practices. The planning, implementation and evaluation of sustainable business models evolves over time within companies and their supply chains, as well as in the marketplace and society. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of this study is that it is exclusively undertaken in Norwegian companies, although the companies are from different industries with different characteristics. Future research is clearly necessary and will be conducted in other countries in similar industries, so as to explore the empirical findings from this study in other contexts. In addition, the interfaces between environmental actions, economic effects and social boundaries need to be investigated further. Originality/value: The study contributes to a growing body of knowledge on corporate reasons for and organizational challenges of sustainable business models, as well as environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable business practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Norway; Sustainable business; Sustainable practices; Triple bottom line",

This article explores four illustrative cases from the Netherlands, where several multinationals started to pioneer with sustainable bonuses in the past few years. The article examines the setups and the different elements of bonus programmes used, in terms of performance criteria (focusing in particular on external vs. internal benchmarking), their link to specific stakeholders, type and size of bonuses, target levels and transparency. While sustainable bonuses signal corporate awareness of responsibility vis-à-vis society and stakeholders, credibility varies considerably depending on these elements. Our case evidence sheds some light on the extent to which sustainable bonuses may be a credible sign of corporate responsibility or rather just another perverse mechanism meant to keep up bonus levels (window dressing). A definite assessment is hampered by the emergent state and lack of full transparency-while 'justified' by companies for competitive reasons, this raises questions.

Human praxis will result, but only when sufficiently powerful interests are motivated to act. This paper aims to examine the role that the accreditation of business schools can play in increasing institutional contradictions and hence fostering organisational change towards stakeholder engagement and engagement with social responsibility and sustainability issues. Numerous accreditations are promulgated within the higher education and business school contexts and a number of these relate to, or have aspects that relate to, ethics, social responsibility and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The paper first analyses the take up of accreditations across UK business schools and then uses a case study to illustrate and explore stakeholder engagement and changes related to ethics, social responsibility and sustainability linked to accreditation processes. Findings: Accreditations are found to be an increasingly common interest for UK business schools. Further, a number of these accreditations have evolved to incorporate issues related to ethics, social responsibility and sustainability that may cause institutional contradictions and may, therefore, have the potential to foster organisational change. Accreditation alone, however, is not sufficient and the authors find that sufficiently powerful interests need to be motivated to act and enable human praxis to affect change. Research limitations/implications: This paper draws on previous research that considers the role of accreditation in fostering change that has also been carried out in healthcare organisations, public and professional bodies. Its findings stem from an individual case study and as such further research is required to explore whether these findings can be extended and apply more generally in business schools and universities in different contexts. Practical implications: This paper concludes by recommending that the newly established UK & Ireland Chapter of PRME encourages and supports signatory schools to further embed ethics, social responsibility and sustainability into all aspects of university life in the UK. This also provides an opportunity to engage with the accrediting bodies in order to further support the inclusion of stakeholder engagement and issues related to this agenda in their processes. Originality/value: This paper contributes by introducing accreditation as an institutional pressure that may lead indirectly to organisational change and supports this with new evidence from an illustrative case study. Further, it draws on the role of institutional contradictions and human praxis that engender organisational change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accreditation; Ethics; Neo-institutional theory; Responsibility; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability",

Taking the ideas of Matten and Crane one step further, we argue that the status of corporations as citizens is not solely defined by their factual engagement in the provision of citizenship rights to others. By analysing political and sociological citizenship theories, we show that such engagement is more adequately explained by a change in the self-conception of corporate citizens from corporate bourgeois to corporate citoyens. While the corporate bourgeois acts primarily for private business purposes, the corporate citoyen engages in society, performing civil and political rights and duties. As an intermediate actor in society, shaped by the principle of subsidiary task-sharing, the corporate citoyen undertakes co-responsibility for social and civic affairs and actively collaborates with fellow citizens below, beside and beyond governmental regulation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bourgeois; Citoyen; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Responsibility; Social doctrine; Subsidiarity",

Assuming CR reflects strategic choices made by firms, the authors seek to move discussions from why aspects to aligning the why with the what/how aspects of CR. The articles in this special issue examine CR initiatives at multiple levels (the firm, industry, national, and global) as well as CR mechanisms ranging from ""go-it-alone"" unilateral activities to collaborative partnerships. The study goals are two-fold. First, the authors focus on firms' attempt to create and manage a portfolio of corporate responsibilities-social, political, environmental, and economic. These responsibilities involve relationships with a range of stakeholders (investors, employees, consumers, suppliers, and distributors as well as its multiple communities), often simultaneously, and recognizing that the corporation can devote limited resources to manage stakeholder expectations in this regard. Second, the authors seek to understand how institutional and competitive contexts matter in shaping specific CR choices to provide tangible evidence of managing responsibly. The authors suggest that consciously aligning CR initiatives (what) with appropriate mechanisms (how) will allow the corporations to efficiently and effectively pursue their CR objectives and arguably create sustained impact. © 2013 SAGE Publications.","corporate responsibility; CSR; initiatives; mechanisms; organizational choices",

The article presents a fuzzy-set analysis of seven hypotheses based on firm-level organizational factors, the macro-institutional context, and the regulatory framework. Results from the analysis of these 25 financial institutions show that public ownership of the bank and the existence of a code of conduct are necessary conditions for participation in the Wolfsberg Group, whereas factors related to the type of financial institution, combined with the existence of a black list, are sufficient for explaining participation. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","banking; corporate responsibility; fuzzy-set analysis; regulation; Wolfsberg principles",

Drawing on social movement theory, we conceptualize how private regulation opportunity structures affect such CR-based activist groups' targets and tactics at both the firm and field levels. At the field level, we argue that both radical and reformative activist groups direct most of their time and resources towards PRIs with comparatively more stringent standards. At the firm level, while radical activist groups are likely to target firms participating in more stringent PRIs, reformative activist groups target firms participating in less stringent PRIs, or those that do not participate in PRIs at all. When facing unfavourable opportunity structures, CR-based activist groups tend either to advocate the creation of new PRIs or to shift their activities to pressure other focal points. This article contributes to moving beyond extant literature's emphasis of PRIs as settlements of contentious firm-activist interactions towards also viewing them as starting points for activist groups aiming to push firms towards a more substantive CR engagement. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.","Activism; Corporate responsibility; Political opportunity structures; Private regulation; Private regulatory initiatives; Social movements",

Within the framework of the MEC, the authors conduct a normative analysis-based on the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)-of the state duties andcorporate responsibilities for adverse human rights impacts in the complex. The authors use a single, indepth case study approach, focussing on the case of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazonian state of Pará. The MEC proves to be a useful framework for studying the advancement of hydroelectricity and mining projects on the Amazonian frontier. The analysis indicates that the Brazilian minerals and energy sectors are mutually dependent and have overlapping interests and decision-making structures. Applying the MEC framework to the Belo Monte case serves to clarify and detangle the relationships between the various actors associated with the dam's adverse impacts. This provides a foundation for the normative analysis of the responsibilities and actions required of each actor based on the internationallyaccepted standards in the UNGPs. By applying the MEC as an analytical research framework and drawing on the UNGPs for normative guidance, the present study contributes to the academic literature on corporate responsibility, as well as providing policy and decision-makers with a normative-empirical analysis that can be drawn upon to improve policy and ensure that corporate activity contributes to sustainable development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An understanding of this relationship can help firms respond to a variety of pressures from organizations and this knowledge may help firms prevent negative media coverage with the need to “bolt” CR strategies on to existing corporate strategies. When firms have an understanding of how country risk affects them, they can plan entire clusters of CR initiatives to fulfill needs within the operating community. To understand the CR–country risk relationship, the authors build on Matten and Moon’s (2008) distinction between implicit and explicit CR. The first argument is that firms engage in no explicit CR (explicit CR that is voluntary and goes beyond legal requirement) when country risk is very high. As country risk lowers to high, firms engage in explicit CR, which creates little impact to the firm if CR must be withdrawn. The second argument is that as country risk shifts to moderate, firms commence to engage in high levels of explicit CR and low levels of implicit CR. The third argument concludes that when country risk shifts to low or very low, firms will engage in the least amount of explicit CR and the most amount of implicit CR. A set of three propositions develops these arguments. © 2013 SAGE Publications.","corporate responsibility; country risk; CSR; CSR strategy",

For many, this has not been an easy transition. This article focuses on a case study of an Australian university program aimed at leveraging staff/student behavioural change and wider institutional change by starting with sustainable transport (ST) in a context where the case study university was coming from a low base on sustainability outside teaching activities. The case study research program aimed to (1) engage with internal and external stakeholders identified with barriers and facilitators to ST, (2) encourage more ST behaviours via explicit Travel Plan strategies and (3) utilize the project to embed ST policy and programs institutionally and act as a catalyst for more extensive and integrated sustainability performance across a multi-camps university. In terms of strategic choice of the case study, this project was the first under the State Government (of Victoria, Australia) HEI TravelSmart program to embrace both staff and students in a 'whole of campus-community approach' to sustainable transport. The methods adopted - using behaviour change activities, travel plan, staff/student surveys and approaches identified with the TravelSmart brand - were not restricted to a social marketing interventions model, but took on an advocacy/feedback approach informed by stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984, 2009) and a stakeholder policy advocacy strategy using a mixed method ecological social marketing model (Halpern et al., 2004). Over a period of four years the funded research facilitated a complex action-oriented case study that achieved some progress towards improved sustainability in travel behaviour and university policies, programs and capital works to address barriers. The participatory design fostered formal and informal networks that developed organizationally to foster environmental politics and develop a form of institutional ecological citizenship (Dobson, 2003) within the steering committee, and in terms of external advocacy. Matched university and government sourced research funding that financed a behaviour change and stakeholder engagement strategy and buy-in from key internal stakeholders, were key facilitators of organizational changes in policy, resourcing and organizational commitment to sustainability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach-Primary data were obtained via a non-sponsored and unsolicited self-administered mail questionnaire distributed to a census of the top 500 Australian companies operating in the private sector administered in both 1995 and 2010. This paper examines and compares the responses of the companies that possessed a code of ethics at those times. Findings-This paper finds that business ethics has continued to evolve over the period of the study and that, in most cases, such an evolution has been positive, with the majority of companies exhibiting high levels of engagement. Research limitations/implications-While the responses provided a rich picture of the evolution of Australian corporate engagement with business ethics, further longitudinal research exploring international and cross-cultural contexts would add to this understanding of organisational engagement. Practical and social implications-It would seem that codes of ethics have evolved beyond a regulatory requirement and are now considered an integral component of the corporate culture and commercial practice in the majority of Australia’s top 500 companies. Originality/value-Despite a history of business ethics research, longitudinal studies seeking to understand the evolution of corporate engagement to business ethics are exceedingly rare. This paper, unique and original in its focus on an Australian context, provides a basis for future studies focused on exploring international and cross-cultural contexts. This paper makes a substantive and valuable contribution to the literature as it quantifies the evolution of corporate engagement over a 15-year period. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Codes; Engagement; Ethics; Evolution; Longitudinal",

Design/methodology/approach – Thirty-four undergraduates in a required course on ethical decision-making in business and organizations completed pre- and post-course assignments assessing their knowledge about crisis/management, as well as their skills in crisis recognition, evaluation and action planning. Participants also completed a survey on their perceptions of the crisis management module and its placement within the ethics course. Findings – Statistical analyses demonstrated significant knowledge acquisition on crisis/management; significant skill development on crisis recognition, evaluation and action planning; and significantly greater “true positives” and significantly fewer “false negatives” in post-course identification of crisis warning signs. Perceptions of the crisis management module and its placement within the course on ethical decision-making were positive. Research limitations/implications – Although the sample size was relatively small, small samples are associated with a greater risk of failing to detect an effect that is present, rather than the greater predicament of erroneously concluding that an absent effect is actually present. This information, coupled with the fact that the results demonstrated not only statistical significance but also large effect sizes using Cohen’s d, inspires confidence. Nonetheless, additional assessment with larger samples would allow for the possibility of convergent evidence. Similarly, additional assessment within different organizational contexts, including applications in human resource training and development is warranted. Future research should also include assessment of specific underlying teaching strategies and evaluation of whether certain models are associated with greater learning on a broader range of crisis management skills. Practical implications – Programs in business ethics education and training comprise one useful context in which to teach corporate crisis management. The program specified here addresses two training needs previously specified in the human resource development (HRD) literature on crisis management, including identifying specific methods of enhancing recognition or detection of crisis warning signs and also of providing tools and enhancing skills for assessing and containing crisis. Originality/value – Despite the centrality of both ethics and HRD to crisis management, there has been a dearth of research on whether ethics education is a useful context through which to teach this topic.

Turning expert GIS based data into something useful, recognisable and digestible by non-expert stakeholders is a challenging task as participants from different cultural and educational backgrounds must intuitively access the information presented. Stakeholder engagement in land use planning scenario development is critical to enhancing the sustainability of a given project. The use of decision support tools can provide a solution for engaging both expert and nonexpert stakeholders. Various real-time decision support tools (DST) have been developed in the past, and recently using programming libraries and frameworks originally developed for commercial video games. In this paper we present a case study where an interactive 3D decision support tool (LEX 3D - Landscape Explorer 3D), was developed to provide a visual impact assessment of proposed housing developments which users can easily locate and change the components of - i.e. layout of the housing within the development, roads and communal green spaces. Additionally, LEX 3D is able to compute and visualise sustainability indicators (e.g. night time street lighting, energy usage and land use ordnance survey data visualisation). We will discuss the steps necessary to streamline GIS data for display in interactive visualisations. We will highlight the games technology techniques implemented that help promote better stakeholder engagement. We conclude that the use of games based decision support tools for planning and sustainability assessment purposes can potentially benefit engagement of non-expert stakeholders.","Computer game; Stakeholder engagement; Strategic planning; Sustainability; Visualisation","Automatic teller machines; Computer games; Data visualization; Decision support systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Housing; Human computer interaction; Land use; Project management; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Visualization; Decision support tools; Interactive visualisation; Programming library; Real-time decisions; Scenario development; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability indicators; Geographic information systems"

Understanding Guanxi, the Chinese social network of reciprocal business relations common in Confucian cultures, has long been recognized as one of the major success factors when doing business in China (Hwang et al., 2009). Recognizing the significant impact of Guanxi and its influence on everyday dealings in China is, thus, crucial for Western firms. Whereas considerable research has dealt with the growth of Chinese industries in recent years, the key relationship between changes in its economy and shifts in Chinese business ethics has been neglected although it impacts the ways Westerners, in particular, both clinch deals and judge Chinese firms. The implications of this disparity for global business are discussed. Design/methodology/approach – The discussion draws on the academic literature and the researchers’ experience in how business and business ethics are conducted between Western and Chinese firms. This paper presents a content analysis of theoretical articles and compares them to conceptual and empirical approaches, with an emphasis on a pragmatic approach to fostering a better understanding of the evolution of Chinese business ethics and its implications on business practices. Findings – Maps the evolution of business ethics in China and need to adapt to an ever changing business environment. Originality/value – This study offers a new insight to the evolution of Chinese business ethics and highlights its importance in business interactions.

Knowledge has become the most important asset of modern businesses, and this study argues that business ethics is associated with the development of intangible knowledge resources-intellectual capital. Businesses with ethical values at the core reinforce ethical conducts and successfully build trust with their various stakeholders, leading to the formation of an ethical and trustworthy corporate culture and a positive corporate environment. Thus, in this reasoning, an ethical approach to business can encourage open communication, problems solving, knowledge sharing and creativity among employees to increase organisational capital; enhance interactions and relationships with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders to increase social capital; attract and retain good talent to increase human capital. Questionnaire survey is adopted as the research method with businesses in the electronic and information technology industries in Taiwan as sample. The results suggest that business ethics is associated with increased intellectual capital. Thus, this study demonstrates that the development of intellectual capital is in line with strengthened ethics.

Several studies have recognized that culture affects ethical behavior. However, very few studies have been conducted on how culture affects managers' attitudes towards business ethics which may predict their ethical behavior especially in developing African countries. The focal point is that this study is to address this knowledge gap in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - The author collected data from 351 managers in selected firms in Nigeria. Two instruments were used to measure Hofstede's five cultural dimensions and attitudes toward business ethics. Correlation and regression analysis were used to test and predict the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables in the study. Findings - Results show that culture has a significant influence on ethical attitudes of managers. The findings also specifically revealed that relationships exist among Hofstede's cultural dimension of power distance, collectivism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, short-term orientation and the dimensions of attitudes towards business ethics. Research limitations/ implications - The generalization of the findings may be limited by some of the sample characteristics. First, the study was limited to six cities in Nigeria; as a result, broader geographic sampling would better represent the national profile. Second, the drop off and pick up method used in data collection and the usual social-desirability bias associated with survey research could be limitations for the study. However, the author took extreme measures to protect the identities of the respondents. Finally, replication of this study using larger samples and a broader geographic base is suggested for cross-validation purposes. Practical implications - Understanding that ethical beliefs and moral decision-making are dependent on culture and play an important role in managing and developing a successful ethics program. The results can help multinational corporations in developing effective culturally based ethical codes of conduct; as well as to design and manage targeted ethical policies and programs that will actively motivate, stimulate, support, encourage, and promote an outstanding ethical organization in Nigeria. Originality/value - There have been very few previous studies on how culture affects managers' attitude toward business ethics within the sub-Saharan African context. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first empirical study on this topic in Nigeria, a sub-Saharan African country. The results provide insights on how culture can influence ethical attitude of managers in Nigeria. As a ground-breaking study on this topic in Nigeria, the findings may provide managers and scholars with an understanding of impact of culture on ethics. The insights gained from this study will contribute to the future research development on this topic in sub-Saharan Africa.

We provide evidence that both better stakeholder engagement and transparency around CSR performance are important in reducing capital constraints. The results are further confirmed using several alternative measures of capital constraints, a paired analysis based on a ratings shock to CSR performance, an instrumental variables approach, and a simultaneous equations approach.

A web content analysis and non-parametric mean comparison statistics of the curricula of undergraduate degrees in all universities in Spain were conducted. The main conclusion of this paper is related to the Bologna effect in Spanish universities. Comparing our results with prior research in this matter, it is demonstrated that the main reason that explains the increase of CSR and ethical education in Spain is the Bologna process and its adaptation to the European Higher Education Area. Also, private universities in Spain are more likely to require an ethics course than public universities.

Conversely, if a firm pursues sustainable development activities initially based on purely altruistic motives, their reputation might improve since at least some customers have a positive willingness to pay for certain reputational characteristics. Again, such a scenario leads to the basic assumption of the firm acting altruistically and without accruing benefits to themselves is thus contradicted. The technology and innovation management literature has developed several concepts that are indispensable for understanding the role of technology for sustainable business development.

Where trust, responsibility and ethics develop",2014,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84938525404&partnerID=40&md5=013122c4c55e45077a244cad1e0a3a95","This article analyzes the role a family plays in the context of business and society. Although it may seem obvious enough that this primary group is fundamental for social organization, certain aspects of this impact, which in the end influences ethical development of social actors are described. The article concentrates on such issues as gift, trust and responsibility as the elements that are naturally present in family life. The problem is presented in an interdisciplinary way because the nature of the issue demands and requires it. Engaging the category of family is important mainly because it has been underemphasized, and this lack of focus has inadvertently supported the domination of the individualistic perspective in economics and business. Such a paradigm is not only the symptom of short-term thinking but also the proof of narrow and reduced anthropology of the economic actor. Families are where people learn the logic of ""gift,"" which is as necessary in business as in other social spheres. George Gilder wrote that ""capitalism begins with giving. Not from greed, avarice, or even self-love can one expect the rewards of commerce, but from a spirit closely akin to altruism, a regard for the needs of others, a benevolent, outgoing, and courageous temper of mind"" (Gilder 1993, p. 21). As such, we should thoroughly examine the role that gift giving plays in the functioning of economy. Secondly, the unique role that a family plays in trust development is presented. According to analysis of Jennifer Roback Morse, families are where people learn to trust. Thirdly, the ability to trust is analyzed as the background for the development of responsibility, a key to developing an ethical attitude. The findings of the paper should help to diagnose the causes of the responsibility crisis and enrich reflection on business ethics by presenting family life as fundamental element in understanding the nature of economic actor and offering family as a useful perspective to understand the process of ethical evaluation of business activity.","Business ethics; Family; Gift; Responsibility; Trust",

The purpose of this paper is to present a case study of the development of a partnership between an environmental non-government organisation (NGO) (world wildlife fund-UK) and a major retailer (Marks and Spencer). The partnership developed three ""types"", sponsorship, technical and communication partnerships. Design/methodology/approach: A grounded theory approach was taken; information was gathered using semi-structured interviews. Data from these interviews were then triangulated with corporate materials to allow generalisations to develop. Findings: Through the three ""types"" of partnership themes of conflict and project drift were identified, although the overarching ""Plan A"" commitment is seen as a potential exemplar in sustainability. Difficulties were identified with respect to the dissemination of the outputs from the partnership, some of which were too complex, where others appeared to change to be more appealing to the consumer. Social implications: Although a single case study, it highlights the challenges and benefits to both partners. As such, it provides insight into the practical issues of delivering sustainability commitments and projects in partnership. Such approaches are critical not only for the viability of business, but also for the long-term health of our planet. Originality/value: This represents a case study of the development of a sustainable partnership between a large corporate and an NGO, which could represent a template for sustainable business.

In light of these benefits to employees and their organizations, organizational scholars are increasingly interested in understanding the factors that contribute to meaningful work, such as the design of jobs, interpersonal relationships, and organizational missions and cultures. In a separate line of inquiry, scholars of business ethics have examined meaningful work as a moral issue concerning the management of others and ourselves, exploring whether there are definable characteristics of meaningful work to which we have moral rights, and whether there are moral duties to ourselves and others to fulfill those rights. In this article, we examine contemporary developments in both disciplines about the nature, causes, and consequences of meaningful work; we explore linkages between these disciplines; and we offer conclusions and research opportunities regarding the interface of ethical and organizational perspectives on performing and providing meaningful work. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Human rights; Meaning of work; Meaningful work; Organization studies; Positive organizational studies; Prosocial behavior",

Integrative social contracts theory holds an intermediate position between ethical universalist and relativist positions - recognizing universal hypernorms on the one hand and moral free space on the other. We argue that all businesses share a common objective of sustaining long-run economic value for their stakeholders. We develop this argument using an evolutionary logic into a hypernorm along three propositions: First, the firm influences, and is influenced by, members of the society (social context proposition). Second, managers maximize profit subject to joint constraints of technical feasibility and ethical norms (managerial decision proposition). Third, ethical norms evolve from interactions among the stakeholders without a central authority. Natural selection favors norms that maximize long run economic value for the society (natural selection proposition). We show that the hypernorm can spawn widely agreed authentic ethical norms. However, moral bounded rationality when interpreting the hypernorm generates different authentic norms in the moral free space. The evolutionary logic is testable along the dimensions of variation, inheritance and selection of ethical norms.","Integrative social contracts theory; International business ethics; Natural selection; Norms; Stakeholder theory",

Streamlining of opportunities for possible integration of sustainability and business process has shown an overwhelming increase of research interests in current literature. At the conceptual level, decisionmaking on areas that concern strategy or long term goals is a crucial task as it directs future status of the firm, at least in the area of sustainability. Thus, long term decisions must be critically designed to address future conditions of the firm. This paper explores how competitive dimensions influence the triple-bottom line. A hybrid approach using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) is shown in this paper to provide insights on such influences. A case study of a group of experts is shown in this work. Results show that businesses which maintain quality as their competitive advantage are likely sustainable as it impacts both economic and social performances. It is also shown that economic and social performances can be traded-off to increase environmental performance. The significance of this paper lies in presenting a range of alternative Pareto optimal solutions which are relevant in providing decision-makers a trade-off in sustainable business performance.","Analytic hierarchy process; Multi-objective linear programming; Pareto front; Sustainable business",

This is true not only for empirical and applied evaluation but also for metatheoretical evaluation. However, while there is increasing interest in the practical utility and empirical testing of ethical theories, there has been little systematic evaluation of how new theories relate to existing ones or what novel conceptual characteristics they might contribute. This paper aims to address this lack by discussing the role of metatheorising in assessing new approaches to ethics. The approach is illustrated through evaluating a new pedagogy and curriculum for ethics education called Giving Voice to Values (GVV). Our method involves identifying a number of metatheoretical lenses from existing reviews of ethical theories and applying these to examine GVV's conceptual elements. Although GVV has been explicitly presented as a pedagogy and teaching curriculum, we argue that it has the potential to contribute significantly to the development of ethical theory. We discuss the general implications of this metatheoretical method of evaluation for new approaches to business ethics and for GVV and its future development. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Communicative ethics; Giving Voice to Values; Metatheoretical evaluation; Metatheory building; Performative ethics",

We find that significant progress is being made by large listed Australian companies towards integrating sustainability into core business operations. There is evidence of leadership structures being put in place to ensure that board and senior management are involved in sustainability strategy development and are then incentivised to monitor and ensure implementation of that strategy through financial rewards. There is evidence of a willingness to engage and communicate clearly the results of these strategies to interested stakeholders. Overall, there appears to be a developing acceptance amongst large corporations that efforts towards improved corporate sustainability are not only expected but are of value to the business. We suggest that this is evidence of a managerial shift away from an orthodox shareholder primacy understanding of the corporation towards a more enlightened shareholder value approach, often encompassing a stakeholder-orientated view of business strategy.

Specifically, I argue that if managers were ""sages,"" the highest moral exemplars and authorities in the Confucian tradition, they would perceive that social rituals alone are often not a contextually intelligent and valued response for the development of intimate communities in the modern workplace. The sage perspective will lead Confucian managers to realize, from their own moral perspective, that they have good reason to balance rites with rights, so long as the adoption is extrinsically valuable and consistent with the Confucian ideal.

This study applies anthropological and legal perspectives to analyze problems related to gender inequality caused by large-scale land acquisitions. It argues that inequalities cannot be resolved by simply changing regulations related to traditional communities' and women's rights and that gender relations and land tenure issues reflect interconnected social arrangements based on historical specificities of traditional communities.

Against this background a quantitative analysis of the ethical practices of 46 companies operating in the Eastern Cape automotive industry was conducted to determine the extent to which ethics-related interventions contributed to establishing and maintaining an ethical organizational environment. A structured online questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data collected was subjected to extensive statistical analyses, including Cronbach Alpha coefficients and item total correlations, and various descriptive statistics were included as a quantitative summary of the data. A constant reference value for the study was also calculated to allow inferences regarding the significance of the tested variables to the study. The results revealed that the organisations in the sample are highly ethical due to the presence of ethics-related interventions, including a code of ethics, committed leadership, adherence to internal and external governance requirements, compliance with legislation and encouragement and disclosure of unethical behaviour. In light of the high number of ethical scandals internationally, this study will add to the empirical body of business ethics research, as it provides organisations with a framework to establish and maintain an ethical business environment. © 2014 University of Pretoria.

Using mixed methodology, 500 entrepreneurs were approached, out of which only 333 responded. In-depth interviews were carried out with five organisations: their entrepreneurs, workers and an external party. The outcome indicates that entrepreneurs prefer practicing business rules. On the contrary to quantitative data, the qualitative facts suggested that entrepreneurs prefer engaging in behavioural pattern, which maximises their self-interests. The study also revealed that the entrepreneurial focus is moving towards a new era of business processing, i.e., re-manufacturing, recycling and re-using. These trends are highly influential and business ethics play a key role in driving them in the future.

Recent findings suggest that management teams experience an increased interest and demand for CSR information from the actors on the stock market and that this underlie a focus shift. This is quite astonishing considering that the interest from just stock market actors in CSR information always has been meagre. However, due to lack of recent studies, it has not been confirmed that de facto there has been a trend shift among stock market actors towards an increased interest in CSR information.Design/methodology/approach - The data are derived from in-depth semi-structured interviews with financial analysts at international investment banks.Findings - The study confirms that the focus shift is not at all driven by the actors in the stock market. Quite the opposite. They express mistrust towards this information and a continued meagre interest in it.Research limitations/implications - Findings from the study suggest the need for more research on how different stakeholders view CSR information. It also opens up for discussions on regulations concerning CSR information.Practical implications - The findings imply that management teams might have deluded themselves and become victim to what Christensen and Cheney (2000) refer to as self-seduces, i.e. seeing things that are not really there. The findings might also indicate an enlargement of the stakeholder perspective. Thus, a subtle shift from a bilateral relationship (company - shareholders) towards a multilateral set of relationships (company - stakeholders) camouflaged under the justification from management teams that the increased interest comes from the stock market.Originality/value - The study contributes to the scarce research on how actors in the stock market view CSR. The findings are of interest and relevance to the business and academic communities in their ongoing quest of unravelling the core of CSR and business ethics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate communication; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Legitimacy; Shareholders; Stakeholders",

Drawing on new strands of research in business ethics, we employ an 'ordonomic' perspective and proceed in four steps. First, we sketch how sustainability semantics has evolved historically from a societal searchlight to a heuristics for business practice. Second, we discuss how business firms can make strategic use of moral commitments as governance contributions by deploying individual or collective self-commitments as well as commitment services in their stakeholder relations. Third, we combine these four governance strategies with the three ESG ('ecological, social and governance') criteria of sustainability. We derive and illustrate with real-life examples a 12-box matrix as a tool for the strategic management of corporate sustainability. Fourth, we discuss the specific contribution of our ordonomic approach to the literature.

It mainly looks at the CSR movement in China in order to explain how the traditional values of Confucianism contributed to the development of CSR discourse which is similar to and differs from some other countries in North America and Europe.Design/methodology/approach: The chapter is primarily theoretical in perspective. It also adopts a discourse approach, specifically Fairclough's three-step approach by drawing upon a large state-owned corporate group's website documents and interview data in order to create new meanings of Chinese CSR shaped by Confucian moral philosophy.Findings: The chapter argues that development of Chinese CSR theory incorporates a revival of Confucian moral philosophy into modern Western business management philosophy. It demonstrates a hybrid model for CSR practices which combine aspects of both Confucian business ethics and Western CSR theory.Research limitations/implications: The research results are valid for state-owned enterprises and may not be generalized to other types of Chinese businesses such as private-owned enterprises and small business enterprises. Further research is needed to develop comparisons.Practical implications: The chapter suggests a people-oriented leadership style which emphasizes the importance of people in the organization and is proven to be successful in the improvement of employee well-being and organizational productivity.Originality/value: The originality of introducing interview data offers a benchmark for the study of CSR discourse in Chinese context. The chapter also provides a guide for business managers to design the strategies based on their own countries' cultural, political, social, and institutional framework.

In this context, the 'business as usual' approach to running businesses with negative environmental consequences is not an option. Industrial ecology and sustainable business models offer solutions on how this transformation can take place. However, transformation of non-manufacturing industries in this respect has not been covered in the literature. The aim of this paper is therefore is to use scientific and industry literature and interview data from the Nordic non-life insurance sector to propose closed-loop insurance models. The new models allow insurance leaders to move away from running the insurance business in an old-fashioned linear way, and thus gain a better understanding of how the business contributes to sustainable development. The transformation of insurers' business models is an example of how business models of non-manufacturing industries can be reinvented to support sustainable economic growth by utilizing ideas from industrial ecology. The new business models proposed place insurance business models within the overall research in industrial ecology, thereby filling an evident gap in the literature by showing that the closed-loop concept applies to non-manufacturers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In dialogue with Wesfarmers Ltd's community partners, the 'realities' presented by these beneficiary stakeholders were interpreted and understood (verstehen). While the CCI programmes with each of the not-for-profit organisations had different objectives, we were able to classify, under broad headings, the nature of the benefits to the community. One question highlighted is whether all corporate investing is the same? We found two aspects to this: the strategic fit for the community organisation of proposed investment and whether the corporate partner sought a relational as opposed to transactional approach to funding provision.

Accordingly, in this paper we have used environmental management theories to examine the responses of firms and NGOs and identify critical 'pressure points' associated with the new laws. The results from our analysis showed that, during the consultations, stakeholders predominantly used pre-emptive responses and communications to shape and change the CEL. In addition, the critical legislative pressure point for business stakeholders was the capacity to manage carbon pricing liabilities in order to maintain sound ongoing financial and investment performance.

Many argue that it was the failure of PT. Lapindo during the drilling process but the verdict of the District Court of South Jakarta decided that it was a natural disaster. Environmental crime provision is stated in The Environmental Management Act 2009 No. 32 but this stipulation does not reduce the number of corporate environmental crimes as there are other factors involved such as enforcement. The protection of people's environmental human rights is also recognized under The Law of 1999 No. 39 on Human Rights. Regrettably, prosecuting corporate environmental crime from the angle of human rights is at a dead-lock due to the fact that the Indonesian Human Rights Court is only authorized to prosecute genocide crimes and crime against humanity.

By changing the details of the scenario, we examine the influence of (a) the harasser’s organizational role (i.e., a supervisor or coworker), (b) the existence of corporate sexual harassment policies, and (c) the company’s past responses to sexual harassment complaints. The results suggested that the harasser’s organizational role is the most important factor for predicting whether an individual would consider pressing a sexual harassment claim. Respondents’ assessment that the victim should make a claim is higher when the harasser is an immediate supervisor rather than a nonsupervisory coworker. Perceived organizational responsibility is also a direct predictor of intent to make a claim. The results provide a clearer understanding of when an individual is more likely to favor making a claim in response to perceived sexual harassment. The practical implications include the following: (a) Sexual harassment training for supervisors is important because their sexual harassment is most likely to lead to a legal claim, (b) antisexual harassment policies have the effect of reducing the likelihood that a victim will perceive the organization as responsible for failing to prevent a supervisor’s action, and (c) organizations should make clear their opposition to sexual harassment both to discourage harassers and to divert a victim’s attribution for responsibility away from the organization if an incident takes place. © The Author(s) 2013.","human resources; legal claiming; organizational attribution; organizational behavior; responsibility attribution",

Based upon conceptual and empirical research in bibliometrics, we suggest an analytical approach to benchmarking the technology management of surprising and potentially damaging phenomena. In order to do so, we propose a method called 'double-loop benchmarking,' which consists of two steps: (1) structural benchmarking, based upon social relationships between actors and actants, and (2) projecting transaction data accumulated through daily business processes as benchmark indicators based upon the social relationships empirically measured in the first step. This paper can be seen as part of a broader agenda for how to manage during continuous but unpredictable change in circumstances of open ignorance. As an empirical study in bibliometrics, we propose a methodological improvement in scientometrics using data repurposing and triangulations. An international comparative analysis reveals empirical evidence that Japan's dynamic technology portfolio on research activities in the fields of electrics, electronics, information, and communications has consistently deviated from that in global trends since the 1990s.

The framework of EDM showed a good practicality through the interviews on an ethical dilemma example. Research limitations/implications: For the ethics training framework, a long-term observation or survey should be accompanied to evaluate the framework in detail, tracing the improvement of ethicalness of course participants. Practical implications: The customized ethics training will be more efficient and effective, as it considers individual ethicality. The scoring system of the EDM framework is simple and practical. This is particularly relevant for construction ethics management, considering that most of construction practitioners are engineers, not philosophers or psychologists. Originality/value: Applying causality concepts, SOC and AAR, to construction ethics is a novel approach in construction management. This research has made a good advancement in construction ethics management by providing the right directions to be explored in these new areas. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited,.","Agent-action-results (AAR); Causality; Construction project; Ethical decision-making; Ethics training; Sphere of control (SOC)",

Although our overall definition of sustainability is a process, the George Washington University (GW) definition of water sustainability is articulated through construction of an objective-value hierarchy representing GW's strategic objectives and articulation of strength of preference among the attributes in that hierarchy. This study used multi-criteria decision analysis methods, including structured interviews with four individual stakeholders and swing weighting. Three findings are of note. First, our stakeholders' thinking about their objectives was greatly influenced by perceived constraints and mandatory obligations on institutional performance implied by contracts or tradition. Second, in considering the trade-off weights obtained from the swing-weighting portion of the value assessment, all stakeholders placed similar emphasis on each of the fundamental objectives. Third, because of the decentralized nature of the university, the process through which the value assessment will be achieved must be transparent and accepted by each of the stakeholders supporting sustainability decisions. This case study illustrates a decision-analytic sustainability approach that may be applied to large-scale infrastructure systems, stakeholder engagement and negotiation in sustainability investments or alternatives assessments. Although the commitment to reduce climate impacts has been widespread, there have been fewer publicly announced water initiatives at the university level. At the university level, GW is only one of a handful of universities with a cohesive, visible, water plan. In addition, we demonstrate an approach in which explicit structuring of fundamental sustainability objectives may increase transparency for sustainability definition construction. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Decision analysis; Higher education; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Strategic planning; Sustainability definition; Urban water sustainability",

It is argued that instructors can incorporate not only generic or thematic learning objectives for students into this method (i.e., the intended content of what is being taught: in our case, an underlying ethical base for doing business), but also do so via a strategically integrated approach regarding the appropriate mix and timing of these micro-insertions. With this in mind, we propose a qualitative and example-based approach that endeavors to provide a versatile way for business teachers to incorporate ethics into their general business classes. We also present a conceptual and theoretical framework that underpins this method, and we further provide a set of specific examples and a practical table that show how business instructors might integrate ethics-oriented micro-insertions into their teaching. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Integrated approach; Micro-insertions; Teaching; Virtue ethics",

Crowd funding is the use of social media to raise funds for various purposes, ranging from community-based endeavors to personal wants. There are several ethical issues surrounding crowd funding: what people actually do with the money; how to deal with people who do not fulfill their promises; whether or not websites should limit funding to specified goals; whether or not recognized artists should be prohibited from participating, in effect competing against aspiring artists. Specific attention is given to the case of artist/musician Amanda Palmer, who raised over $1 million on Kickstarter.com for an album project that had only $100,000 as an initial goal. She later admitted that she spent the rest of the money that was raised on personal expenses. This case has a difficulty level appropriate for a junior or senior level course, although it may be used at a first-year graduate level, depending on the amount and complexity of the background information that is assigned. This case requires from one hour (if the instructor's goal is class discussion only) to four hours of preparation (if the instructor's goals involve presentations by individuals or teams of students). This is a timely topic of much interest to young students who are heavily influenced by social media, and particularly those entrepreneurial students who might view social media as a means of raising funds for their projects. Case Synopsis: Social media, especially in the form of crowd funding, presents many ethical issues. For the websites and platforms, what sorts of projects should be funded? For the artists, what types of projects should be funded and for what amount? For investors, which artists should be funded, for how much, and what should one do if the artist does not fulfill their promises? This analysis focuses on the real-life case of Amanda Palmer, an artist/ musician who posted a $100,000 album project on Kickstarter.com. Palmer offered several levels of incentives for contributions, from autographed copies of the album, to concerts at the contributor's home. Within a short period of time Palmer raised over $1 million. She later admitted that she used some of the additional funds for personal expenses. This case raises numerous ethical issues. For the websites: should they allow established artists to raise funds through their websites? Should those who seek funding be limited to the amounts necessary to fund their projects? Also, should the proprietors of the websites monitor those who seek funding to determine how they actually use the money that is raised? For the contributors: should they contribute to projects that already exceed the requested amount by the artists? And how should one deal with artists who spend contributions frivolously or do not fulfill their promises to contributors? For the artists: what is the appropriate amount of funding to request for project? How should an artist deal with excess funds that are contributed to a project? Are there ethical obligations to contributors, especially when many of them may know that they are contributing funds in excess of a project's requirement?.",,

Therefore, we focus on three interrelated components: (1) Stakeholders and corresponding classification according to their level of influence and attitude towards an artefact; (2) ET which encompasses five dimensions, namely Governance Changes, Business Model Changes, Business Process Changes, Structure Changes, and Resource Changes; and (3) Benefits classified according to their different degree of explicitness and hence importance to each stakeholder. In order to assess ET in a feasible way, we advocate mapping every single change with its corresponding benefit. Subsequently, these pairs of changes and benefits are assigned to a group of ""Change Owners"", who are responsible for ensuring that ET is measured and successfully achieved. Finally, we summarize the four phases of ET Lifecycle (Envision, Engage, Transform, and Optimise phase) as well as the corresponding steps required to properly apply the η Framework.","Benefit-Driven Change; Change Management; Enterprise Transformation; Enterprise Transformation Lifecycle; Stakeholder Engagement; η Framework","Information systems; Life cycle; Benefit-Driven Change; Business modeling; Business process change; Change management; Enterprise transformation; Holistic visions; Interrelated components; Stakeholder engagement; Industry"

Many believe that project management, change management, and related fields, are a matter of marshalling stuff: working the right processes and tasks, writing the correct documents, having good governance mechanisms in place, etc. People just distract and get in the way. Some tend to concentrate on these technicalities working their computer tools, rather than leaning towards people. The result is huge waste. Organisational change will always cut across different business functions, boundaries and across silos of working. This is where stakeholder engagement leads to successful outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: It is a surprise to many, but listening is probably the most powerful influencing strategy of all. The key is to ask the person you seek to influence, first for their thoughts, fears, and aspirations. If you can show you are genuinely interested, you begin to break down any barriers to change. This helps focus on the need for change rather than present the solution first. Yes, time is money, but often we can let this get in the way of engaging successfully. Conversations like this do take time. It feels counter-intuitive. Findings: There is growing evidence that people who make better leaders have a leaning towards action, they are never victims of ""paralysis by analysis"". The self-aware, pro-active manager leading change understands that relationships are central to success and are thinking about their relationships in a real and active way. They think about their mental landscape and on that landscape they see the vital importance of stakeholders and are prepared to spend a far higher proportion of their discretionary time devoted to engaging with other people, quite apart from the structured meetings and emails that we usually describe as ""communicating"". Originality/value: Most management books are written with the assumption that the business world is rational, but when it comes to change, it appears this is far from the case. We are taught to put a reasonable proposition to people, the business case, the plan, and so on, then expect people to mull it over for a while, then jump into action - reason - analyse - act. But nearly always the actual sequence is - see - feel - act. There is little doubt that people engage with their stakeholders better if there is some kind of emotional connection. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change; Engagement; Project management; Stakeholders",

In 2011, the city completed a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory that serves as the basis for current sustainability planning processes, and the process to complete this analysis was uniquely collaborative and is offered as a case study. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This inventory was the product of collaboration between the city, the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and the Central New York Regional Planning and Development Board, through the Climate Change Innovation Program. Following guidance from International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives's Local Government Operations Protocol and utilizing Clean Air and Climate Protection software, the baseline year for the inventory was 2002, and the municipal analysis covered five sectors: buildings and facilities, vehicle fleet, aviation, water delivery, and streetlights and traffic lights. The city's community analysis assessed residential, commercial and industrial energy use, transportation and waste sectors. Findings: The City of Syracuse has achieved energy and GHG reductions over the inventory timeframe. While savings have been accomplished, significant challenges to future energy and GHG reductions remain. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include obtaining data quality and consistency for analysis. Practical implications: This case study could serve as a model for moving forward with GHG inventory analysis and action for small- to medium-sized cities in the NE, USA. Social implications: This was an experiment in collaboration between an academic institution, NGOs and a municipal entity. Originality/value: The city's 2010 inventory has been followed by community outreach and stakeholder engagement for the sustainability planning process. The city formed advisory teams composed of community experts in the areas of energy and green building, natural environment, waste and recycling, education and outreach, and food systems.

Islamic banking expanded in the world within the last decade and as a result, Islamic finance emerged as an alternative to the conventional finance. This created Islamic companies and Islamic financial institutions which operate based on the principles of Shari'ah or Islamic Law. These Islamic corporate bodies, like the conventional corporate bodies do need good governance rules. In other words, they also need a good, sophisticated ""Shari'ah Governance Code"" which would be based on the principle of Islamic Law. This is mainly because the objective of the conventional and the Islamic Corporate governance is different as conventional corporate governance structure is more focused on the protection of the rights of the stakeholders; while Islamic corporate governance focus on retaining the Islamicity of whole corporation. The objective of this research is, as the title suggests, proposing the reasons why a special governance Code for Shari'ah corporate bodies are needed.

Methodology/approach-The chapter draws heavily on a politicized concept of CSR, namely 'corporate citizenship' (Crane, Matten, & Moon, 2008a; Matten & Crane, 2005) and 'political CSR' (Scherer & Palazzo, 2007, 2011) and discusses the role SNS providers play in administering citizenship rights. The chapter takes a qualitative case study approach. Findings-Facebook, Twitter and Google have not only made clear commitments to act responsibly, they actually enhance the citizenship status of their users in many ways, e.g. by offering a platform for democracy activists. Deficiencies and contradictions also become visible, e.g. SNS providers inhibit citizenship by failing to provide sufficient privacy protection. Research limitations/implications-The chapter is limited by its case study approach, but provides valuable insights to an industry with considerable influence. It contributes to CSR research by applying and testing the politicized concept of CSR in the context of SNS providers. Originality/value- Although SNS have received appraisal as effective tools of CSR communication, there has been little attention to CSR policy and practice of the companies providing social networks. This is unfortunate since the activities of SNS providers directly impact on millions of users worldwide.

It aims to adopt a structuralist and functionalist perspective and develop an enabling conceptualisation of power that incorporates structural and agency components in stakeholders’ reasons for engaging. Based on the conceptual interdependencies between stakeholder power and engagement, this study aims to present the limitations of previous studies on destination leadership in this area, and this paper also seeks to discuss implications for destination leadership. Design/methodology/approach – As a qualitative and exploratory study, mixed-method research was adopted using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with destination stakeholders from a prominent tourism action group. The primary research was carried out in an English seaside resort between 2010 and 2011. Data are used to draw a stakeholder map as a visual tool. Findings – Eight elements of enabling power are confirmed to be of importance in identifying stakeholder power and engagement. The level of power varies depending on stakeholders’ position within a network. These findings direct attention towards adopting a complexity leadership approach in an increasingly competitive destination environment. Research limitations/implications – The paper focuses on an English seaside resort, although results can be transferred to other similar-sized destinations where the focus is on local tourism policy development. Originality/value – The paper provides an innovative conceptualisation of power in stakeholder theory by drawing primarily on a sociological understanding of power as an enabler and not as an inhibitor for development, leadership and change in seaside resorts.

Doing so highlights the strategic, relational nature of place branding. The authors focus specifically on first- and zero-order capabilities, integrating absorptive capacity (first-order) and an innovation capability (zero-order) into a place branding framework. We define an innovation capability within a place branding context and offer absorptive capacity as a mechanism through which DMO leaders can exploit external knowledge acquisition.Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a theoretical framework of the place branding process that integrates firm capabilities. A framework based on analyzing existing place branding models and integrating organizational capabilities, which find root in strategic management literature, was developed.Findings – Findings indicate that existing frameworks address operational and customer capabilities in some manner yet largely ignore innovation capabilities. A definition of an innovation capability for place brand managers and scholars is offered, and offer absorptive capacity as means to integrate external knowledge into the DMO. Utilizing multiple levels of capabilities allows a firm to influence customer-based brand equity. Testable propositions based on the authors’ framework are offered.Practical implications – Managerial implications of integrating stakeholder capabilities into place branding include appreciating a culture of innovation within DMOs, learning from external stakeholders meaningfully and regularly and encouraging creative thinking that can produce new processes, policies or services.Originality/value – By integrating organizational capabilities, attention is drawn to internal aspects of the place branding process the place can control directly. Capabilities dictate how an organization sees itself; learns from its stakeholders; and then integrates that knowledge into organizational, stakeholder and innovation capabilities. Therefore, capabilities are inherently internal mechanisms through which a DMO can influence place brand outcomes, which are understood here as brand equity elements. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Organizational capabilities; Place branding; Stakeholder engagement",

Where these construction sites are not managed effectively, they can negatively impact their surrounding community. The aim of this paper is to identify and document, in an urban context, the numerous issues encounter and subsequent strategies adopted by on-site contractors and local people, in the mitigation of factors which negatively impact their surrounding community. The objectives in achieving this aim are to identify what effect, if any, an urban construction site has on its surrounding environment, the issues and resulting strategies adopted by contractors on the factors identified, and also what measures are put in place to minimise such disturbances to the local community. In order to meet the requirements, a mixed methodology is adopted culminating in a literature review, case study analysis, contractor and community interviews, concluding in the development of two specific questions for both perspectives in question. The data is assessed using severity indices based on mean testing in the development of key findings. The results indicate that the main forms of disturbance to the local community from an urban development include noise, dust and traffic congestion. With respect to a contractor on-site, the key issues include damaging surrounding buildings, noise control and off-site parking. The resulting strategies identified in the mitigation of such issues include the implementation of noise and dust containment measures and minimising disruption to local infrastructure. It is envisaged that the results of this study will provide contractors operating in such environments, with the required information which can assist in minimising disruption and therefore, avoiding disputes with the local community members. By consulting with and surveying those most affected, this research will illustrate to on-site management, the difficulties faced by those who accommodate such developments within their living environment.","Community; Confined site; Site management; Stakeholder engagement; Urban development","Contractors; Dust; Project management; Traffic congestion; Community; Confined site; Site management; Stakeholder engagement; Urban development; Urban growth"

We then apply main path analysis to identify and visualize the local, global, and key-route main paths. The local and global main paths identify those papers that play a key role in the knowledge diffusion of CSR. The key-route main path clearly exhibits the divergence-convergence pattern of CSR development. Although the divergence-convergence pattern of a theory's development has been hinted at in previous literature, we propose the key-route main path to systematically identify and exhibit it.

Traditionally, project management is considered to be performance focused and task oriented, whilst programme management entails a more strategic focus. The programme management literature suggests that this can result in tensions between the management of the projects and the programme as a whole. This paper uses the findings of the €2.4. billion Room for the River flood protection programme in the Netherlands as a case study, because indicators about its budget, time, quality and stakeholder satisfaction suggest high programme management performance upon completion of the planning and design stage of its 39 river widening projects. Based on a literature review, document analysis and 55 face-to-face interviews, we have analysed how the programme management of the programme contributed to this result. Six attributes for effective programme management that are identified from the project and programme management literature are used to structure the research data. Consecutively, the interactions between project and programme management are analysed. The analysis of Room for the River reveals a combined strategic/performance focus at the level of both programme and project management that enables a collaborative approach between programme and project management. This particularly enables effective stakeholder collaboration, coordination and adaptation of the programme to contextual changes, newly acquired insights and the changing needs of consecutive planning stages, which positively contributes to the performance of the programme as a whole. © 2014 IPMA and Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive programme management; Alignment; Flood protection; Netherlands; Programme management; Programme success; Project management; Room for the River; Stakeholder engagement","Alignment; Budget control; Flood control; Floods; Project management; Rivers; Flood protection; Netherlands; Programme management; Programme success; Stakeholder engagement; Information management; adaptive management; flood control; performance assessment; planning method; project management; stakeholder; strategic approach; Netherlands"

A Europe wide stakeholder engagement, consisting of over 50 face-to-face interviews with key informants with energy efficiency retrofit (EER) knowledge and expertise, informed analyses on flows of both tangible and intangible value for commercial EER projects. Findings – Given the need to expand the EER marketplace, the sustainability of EER processes is as important as the sustainability of EER project outcomes. Understanding value creation in retrofit processes is crucial to successfully harnessing the available energy savings potential from the built environment. Practical implications – The increasing importance of externalities, such as carbon, means that previously unaccounted for costs are now being considered in business models.

The findings support only two of the five dimensions of the Walsh et al. scale. These are customer orientation and competitiveness of the firm. None of the original reputation dimensions or items associated with good corporate citizenship, such as good employer and being socially and environmentally responsible, was part of the dimensions that remained after the statistical analyses.

We theorize the challenges of designing such systems wherein they are expected to address the needs of multiple users with different interests that may emerge from different economic, social, political and/or cultural perspectives, as they relate, for example, to sustainability reporting, ethical investment, participatory development studies and indigenous resource management. Using dialogic engagement, we attempt to move beyond traditional, and often highly constrained, conceptualizations of ""stakeholder engagement"" and propose a framework for undertaking systems design that can facilitate high quality and relevant SEA information systems that meet the needs of a wide range of actual and/or potential users.

To date, most attention has been focused on similarities and differences in geology, service industry, and gas price while consideration of environmental stewardship has been dominated by concerns over the potential environmental and health impacts of hydraulic fracturing. Broader issues of local water security, wastewater management, and landscape impact have, in contrast, received less attention. To address these issues, the authors take an alternative look at the European market by using experiences in the US and Australia to consider the risk-management practices, regulatory measures, and stakeholder-engagement techniques that have achieved greatest success in stimulating the industry while, at the same time, protecting environmental assets. Although the industries in the US and Australia exhibit notable differences to those that may develop in Europe, several overarching observations can be made. The importance of stakeholder collaboration, transparency, and carefully defined boundaries of jurisdiction are some of the key factors identified. Drawing lessons from these examples and others, the authors conclude by identifying three initiatives essential to the emergence of a viable, publicly acceptable, and sustainable unconventional gas industry in Europe: 1. Collecting robust and reliable environmental baseline data 2. Using and communicating sound science 3. Implementing collaborative governance Failure to implement these initiatives could stifle projects, breed uncertainty, promote conflict with existing industries and the public, and potentially discourage investment. Conversely, by implementing the three recommendations, Europe would be in a better position to encourage unconventional gas development in a manner that secures social and economic benefits while maintaining high levels of environmental stewardship.

Community leaders are being lobbied to consider the needs of all types of caravanning visitors to their communities. Conflict and positional power struggles are thus surfacing within national caravanning communities and within national, state and local community governance arenas. This paper provides an overview and an assessment of the history and status quo of the issues. It is structured to first set the broader political contest within a local context, and this informs a working definition of freedom camping. We then review the growing, but limited and fragmented, international literature concerning freedom camping; discuss the phenomenon of freedom camping with reference to supply and demand issues, including the oversimplified descriptions of freedom campers' motivations; and finally, highlight the complex nature of stakeholder engagement and influences on policies as they relate to freedom camping through policy dialogues. The planning and management of spaces and places as limited resources are inherently political activities and are valued for a variety of competing uses by users with diverse perceptions and motivations across time. Through this exploratory analysis, we identify the perspectives of key stakeholders in the policy process, provide a baseline for future discourse on issues relating to freedom camping and conclude with a call for further critical analysis on this subject to inform rational debate on policy-making, planning and management implications for regional and urban communities. © 2014, © 2014 Australia and New Zealand Association of Leisure Studies.","caravanning; contested spaces; dispositional power; leisure; local government; policy; recreational vehicle (RV); wicked problems",

While considerable research has been conducted on CSR in developed countries, the extant literature on CSR in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is scant and CSR is seen in terms of philanthropy. This paper aims to examine CSR from a broader perspective and in particular to identify the factors that hinder and promote CSR activities in SSA using the Smit (2009) CSR Value Chain Model. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on data obtained from a survey conducted by GTZ (now GIZ) on factors promoting and hindering CSR in SSA. The study surveyed 85 companies from six countries, namely; South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Namibia. The study essentially examined the internal and external CSR environments of the companies in the participating countries. Findings – The study revealed that there are nine key promoting and hindering factors of CSR for businesses in SSA. These include: leadership and governance, policy framework, project management, monitoring, evaluation and reporting, stakeholder engagement, staff engagement, government, funding and beneficiation. The study recommends a systemic and context-sensitive approach that relies on the potential of organisations and communities to design and implement their own solution within global frameworks in order to further develop CSR in the region. Research limitations/implications – There are a number of limitations in this study. First, this study did not include any informants from the responding organisations’ stakeholder groups, but relied mainly on information obtained from single respondents from organisations. Further research should include responses from other stakeholder groups. Practical implications – To promote or achieve the successful implementation of CSR and broaden its scope within the region beyond its current focus on philanthropy, managers must build bridges with their stakeholders through both formal and informal dialogues and engagement practices. Additionally, firms may enhance and maximise both social and economic value created when managers link their CSR activities to areas that improve firms’ long-term competitive potential by collectively and systematically applying their distinctive strengths to such activities in accordance with the value chain model. Originality/value – The finding in this study is novel and adds an important contribution to the developing CSR literature in the SSA region. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR hindering factors; CSR supporting factors; Philanthropy; Sub-Sahara Africa",

It aims to analyse the community impact of two Indian five-star hotels operating in Goa, a tiny coastal state. Design/methodology/approach - The study applies a case study method to examine the employment and environmental practices of the Vivanta by Taj and Leela Kempinski. Qualitative research methods were used, including interviews with management, community leaders, and workers. Secondary data were gathered from company web sites and promotion materials as well as applications under the national Right to Information Act to access official records in the pertinent government bodies. Findings - An analysis of the findings shows that CSR in India's tourism industry is currently limited to corporate self-reporting on indicators of the companies' choice or, in some cases, the minimum required by regulatory bodies. In the absence of tight regulatory oversight and pressure from local civil society, company reports present a one-way channel of communication of the companies' perception and practice of CSR. The paper concludes that the industry has yet to move beyond traditional philanthropy to embrace contemporary principles of CSR which include corporate transparency, multi-stakeholder engagement, and community empowerment. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the limits of CSR in an analysis of the actual practice, rather than just communication of CSR. By examining two Indian hotels' CSR practices from the perspective of external stakeholders, the paper contributes empirical data that highlights the role of CSR beyond the interests of the corporation in its relevance to the community.

However, despite external environmental pressures commonly regarded as one of the main drivers of business model evolution, there is a lack of studies that explore business model innovation as a result of multiple stakeholder influences. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to examine the changing university business model within a region of the United Kingdom, using a stakeholder perspective that will aid theoretical development and refinement in both the business model and stakeholder fields. This examination is aided by consideration of the university business model as an activity system. Repeat interviews, combined with stakeholder theory, have been used to show how the changing university business model-stakeholder relationship has progressed through different stakeholder stages with resultant changes in content, structure and governance. Furthermore, conflicting objectives between each of the stakeholder groups (i.e. academics, industry liaison staff, technology transfer office staff and government support agency representatives) have led to the university business model evolving not as a process of co-creation but rather in a series of transitions whereby multiple stakeholders are continually shaping the university business model through strategies that are dependent upon their salience. Finally, this paper contributes to the development and refinement of business model innovation research, in that the use of stakeholder constructs can illustrate the impact of multiple stakeholders' power and influence on business model innovation. © 2014 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,

Design/methodology/approach: Through a meta-theoretical analysis in which theories themselves become the unit of creative synthesis, a wider framework is developed to allow a comprehensive and nuanced reinterpretation of the neo-institutional theory and the resource-based view. In focus is the practical utility and relevance of such theories within emerging economies where pharmaceutical firms respond to market and institutional changes. Findings: The imperative for organizational change is very much dependent on the combination of ethically constrained managerial choices as well as entropic institutional pressures that allow firms to successfully adapt to their dynamic environment. This is achieved through legitimization and sustained competitive advantage, the results of innovation and contextually relevant differentiated value propositions. Social implications: Contrary to popular perceptions, recent developments demonstrate that the simultaneous pursuit of efficiency and ethical preferences is possible, irrespective of the institutional matrix within which change occurs. Managers should, therefore, tap into the niche opportunities offered by favorable entropic pressures.

The findings indicate that SMEs can create responsible innovations with very different resource combinations. The most common resource combination comprises equity, research and development cooperation, networks, industry knowledge and reputation. Except for financial capital in the form of equity, which appears a necessary condition for responsible innovation from SMEs, resource needs vary between technological and business model innovations. Creating business model innovations appears to be possible with scarce resources, at the very least with equity and social capital.

As an alternative, private regulation, developed and administered by companies, industry associations, and nongovernmental organizations, has emerged to safeguard economic, environmental, and social sustainability in producer countries and along the value chain. The academic literature on private regulation in global value chains has grown over the last decade, but currently few major reviews of the research have been undertaken. This paper examines peer-reviewed research in the relevant disciplines published in academic journals up to December 2011. Our goal is to identify and classify the topics and theories in the global value chain literature. We conclude that the number of articles explicitly examining private regulation, in a global value chain context, is relatively small when considering the importance and growth of these chains in the world’s economy. We also conclude that agriculture, forestry, and apparel manufacturing are the most often studied economic sectors; in contrast, other sectors, such as the information, communication and technology, with their complex global value chains, and often problematic environmental and social conditions, are understudied. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate responsibility; Ethical trade; Global value chains; Private regulation; Sustainability",

The authors draw lessons from this experience and propose ways to apply those lessons to other financial institutions.Methodology/approach: The chapter is based on an in-depth case study of ShoreBank. It includes extensive interviews with two of the bank's cofounders, who served as the bank's leaders for more than 37 years.Findings: The case study has identified six key enabling factors for social innovation: (1) a social purpose that is deeply, and effectively, embedded in the organization's mission, strategy, and operations; (2) an ownership structure to support the social mission and a structure (e.g., bank holding company) that facilitates social innovation; (3) capital capacity - that is, ability to create credit through leverage; (4) a deep level of knowledge about the business, the clientele, and the operating environment; (5) talented people who bring both skill and passion for the mission to the institution-building process; and (6) the discipline to continuously innovate, at a scale appropriate to the problem, with resources that are adequate to the challenge.Limitations: This work has several limitations including a focus on one U.S. bank holding company, and based on interviews with that bank's cofounders.Social implications: The chapter provides a rich description of how social innovation through social investment created a meaningful social impact. Important lessons and useful recommendations are drawn for social enterprises that are committed to social innovation in the financial services industry.Originality: The chapter provides insights into the ShoreBank case based on a unique set of data.

The findings reveal major breakthroughs across the six principles, especially in reorienting curricula, delivery methods, research and developing win-win partnerships and dialoguing platforms. There are business schools that have moved from establishing standalone modules addressing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues to mainstreaming ESG aspects across the whole spectrum of programmes offered and wholly transforming business schools ethos towards sustainability. Teaching methods are migrating from traditional chalk and talk, case studies and syndicate approaches to hidden curricula that, in addition to drawing from traditional teaching approaches; embraces experiential, reflexive and action oriented learning methods. To take ESG issues further, some business schools have revamped their governance and put in place sustainability policies assisting them to walk the talk.

The recent economic downturn of the Greek economy stresses the need for redefining current business models, attitudes and practices.Design/methodology/approach - The authors draw from prior literature on strategic corporate responsibility and build their arguments on the value of social responsibility as an important component of an exit strategy from the domestic economic crisis.Findings - Promoting the social responsibility of business could yield win-win opportunities for Greek firms and have a positive effect on the regeneration of the national economy's dynamics. Connecting the well-established strategic CSR literature with the specific handicaps of an economy under pressure, we point out that the current deep crisis can be alleviated by regaining the trustworthiness, supporting the competitiveness potential and enhancing the extroversion of the Greek economy.Practical implications - Strategic options from which policymakers and managers can endorse the development of a CSR agenda as an exit strategy component are set forth. Such practical implications pertain to the creation of an enabling environment for strategic CSR implementation, an emphasis on CSR-related amelioration of competitiveness parameters and a redefinition of market orientation of domestic firms under the scope of socially responsible business behaviour.Originality/value - An economic-business environment under extreme pressure is discussed; problems relevant to the Greek case are outlined while a new approach in the way of doing business is proposed.","Business strategy; Corporate social responsibility; Economic crisis; Greece; Proposition development",

Following the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in 2010, BP plc. was accused of having set new records in the degree of divergence between its actual operations and what it had been communicating with regard to corporate responsibility. Its legitimacy crisis is here to be appraised as a case study in the discrepancy between symbolic and substantive strategies in corporate greening and its communication. A narrative analysis of BP's ""beyond petroleum""-rebranding and the ""making this right""-campaign issued in response to the Gulf of Mexico disaster discusses their respective implications for (green) corporate change. Further, the question is addressed why BP's green image endeavors were so widely accepted at first, only to find themselves dismissed as corporate greenwashing now. The study concludes that where a corporation's ""green narrative"" consistently evokes established narratives, its legitimacy will be judged against narrative, rather than empirical truth. Thus, the narrative will be more willingly accepted as speaking for the issuing company's legitimacy, irrespective of whether it reflects substantive greening or not. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","BP; Corporate communication; Corporate environmental responsibility; Image crisis; Impression management; Narrative analysis",

Findings: The results obtained suggest that some specificity may be present in the way of defining corporate responsibility for society by Portuguese companies. The Portuguese companies analysed seem to display an historical preference for corporate paternalism. This suggests that moral reasons can motivate firms (and individuals within them) to engage in social responsibility activities.

The Italian experience on the development and adoption of harmonised indicators is considered here as an example of problems and possible solutions. Design/methodology/approach-Preliminary analysis shows that, in the Italian situation, two main gaps exist. The first one relates to the incomplete statistical information on the magnitude and performance of TSOs; the second is related to the lack of a set of harmonised indicators. To address these problems, two initiatives have been recently set up in Italy. On the one hand, the newly presented “National Strategy on Social Corporate Responsibility-2012-2014” has been oriented to fill the statistical gap, by extending the compilation of socio-economic and environmental accounts to TSOs; on the other hand, a joint initiative of the Italian Statistical Institute and the CSR Manager Network Italia towards the harmonisation of the “Global Reporting Initiatives-quantitative performance indicators” and the standards of the Italian statistical system. Within the second initiative, a specific sub-set of performance indicators for TSOs is proposed and presented in this paper. Findings-The Italian experiences reported here, together with the set of proposed indicators, can be used to improve data collection and to move towards a common framework for performance evaluation in the TSOs. Originality/value-The main contribution of the proposed set of indicators is to: first, provide standard definitions and clear calculation methods; second, define quantitative measurements allowing for aggregation; and third, promote data collection and performance evaluation in a context, as the Italian one, where statistical information for TSOs is largely incomplete. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Global reporting initiatives; Harmonized indicators; Inter-organizations comparability",

The results prompt a redefining of information sharing to capture these broader system notions, furthermore provides a foundation for identifying and explaining historic forms of collaboration that have led to both failures and successes. This paper also reviews the common information sharing safeguards that lead to shared understanding and collaborative outcomes. We map these safeguards against the failures for developing collaboration strategies, and classify them according to six basic systems engineering categories of governance, processes, operations, acceptance, performance measurement, and resource management.

After positioning PPP in the current stakeholder management theory, a comparative case study analysis of four PPP infrastructure projects demonstrates the relevance and importance of stakeholder inclusion in PPPs. The case study findings indicate that a PPP makes the stakeholder environment more complex to manage, due to the increasing importance of the stakeholder context and dynamics. Hence, allocating stakeholder responsibilities between the public initiator and private consortium becomes problematic as it goes hand in hand with balancing between reactive and proactive responses to stakeholder claims.

It is based on a literature review, multidisciplinary academic meetings, interviews with SC directors of two global companies operating in a reputation-sensitive environment, and desk analysis of companies' documental flows. Findings reveal that communication accomplishes four basic functions: 1) it helps embedding and spreading cultural values along internal SC units; 2) it supports conflict resolution and compensation among different managerial logics; 3) it encourages development and maintenance of relationships with SC partners; 4) it enhances the fine-tuning among SC phases and activities, supporting alignment and integration of procedures and routines. Finally, the study points out that communication is typically face-to-face when it has to support the strategic SC phases, whereas it is typically computer-mediated when supporting SC operational phases.

Social media puts pressure on companies to do so and integrates different stakeholders' expectations towards and perceptions of a company with regard to CSR. Thus, social media are a suitable source for companies to match their CSR self image with their CSR public image. Data mining techniques and related software helps companies to assess their CSR public image and to adjust their CSR when there is a mismatch between self image and public image. This initiates a continuous CSR (control) cycle which helps companies to forecast accuracy of their firm value and to gain long-term competitive advantage against companies which do not manage and control their CSR strategically. © Markus Stiglbauer, Anna-Lena Kühn, Christian Häußinger, 2014.","Corporate social responsibility; Data mining; Firm reputation; Firm value; Social media; Stakeholder management",

Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature was conducted to examine the characteristics of learning organizations and those that encourage and support ethical behavior. Findings: There are significant parallels between the characteristics of learning organizations and those of ethical organizations. These include leadership, culture, communication, systems thinking, and problem-solving orientation, which are important in creating learning organizations and in encouraging ethical behavior. These parallels encourage social network stimulation, acceptance of new ideas, open discussion, the ability to disagree without rancor, a lessening of hierarchy, employees seeing themselves as part of a larger whole. All of these elements create an environment wherein organizational members are able to contend with and resolve ethical problems. Practical implications: When endeavoring to foster an ethical organizational environment, managers can be aware of the benefits of creating a learning organization, as the two correspond closely. Additionally, managers in learning organizations can leverage this capacity to enhance ethical decision making and behavior. Originality/value: Research on learning organizations has often centered on their value in encouraging innovation and on strategies for implementing the changes needed to establish them. This paper identifies and discusses the parallels between the characteristics of learning organizations and ethical organizations.

Findings: First, the paper argues that by conflating values and preferences, rational choice theory fails to recognize an essential function of values, which govern the relationship between the personal and the social. Second, it describes the emergence of brand markets within traditional Muslim commodity economies. Third, it uses these distinctions, between the personal and the social and between commodity and brand economies, to construct four ideal types of Muslim economic actors: ""collectivists"", ""differentialists"", ""integrationists"", and ""entrepreneurs"".

The formalist position, that fair play requires playing within the rules, is explored as are notions of playing to the rules, gamesmanship and cheating. It is argued that ethical problems in elite sport increase as a result of external factors including the celebrity of sportspeople, a tarnished image of some administrators, influences of external stakeholders (e.g. the mass media, commercial sponsors and betting interests), and the expectations of fans. Hence a worryingly negative picture of declining ethical standards in the face of internal and external pressures emerges, with little prospect of sports reforming from within, despite that appearing to be in a sport's best interests. © 2014 The Author Business Ethics: A European Review © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,

Although previous works have shown that conventional marketing theories were, to a certain extent, able to predict factors influencing halal marketing and Islamic mortgage, these theories fail to capture or accommodate the Islamic perspectives of consumer behaviour. Conventional marketing theories have also been found to be inadequate to explain the Islamic mortgage preference among consumers. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing upon the Maqasid al-Shariah, this study develops an Maqasid al-Shariah index (MSI) and religious satisfaction (RS) for Islamic mortgage industry in Malaysia. These indexes are developed as the basis of the theory development in this setting. The model developed is later examined using survey data. Findings – This study reveals that education and RS are instrumental in determining the Islamic home financing preference. In contrast, justice and welfare are insignificantly related to the Islamic home financing preference. Religious satisfaction, to a certain extent, plays role not only as a mediator but also as a moderator. We find that RS has a full mediation effect on the relationship between welfare and willingness to consider applying Islamic mortgage. We discover justice is moderated by RS. Education and welfare however are not moderated. Originality/value – This study contributes to the development of an empirical Islamic framework in predicting consumers’ behaviour in an Islamic mortgage market using a Maqasid approach.

It suggests that this narrative stands in the way of meaningful ethics integration in business education in part because it fails to encourage or even acknowledge insights that are ""felt"" rather than merely intellectually registered. Philosopher-writers like Henri Bergson, William James, and Friedrich Nietzsche agree that a large part of experience escapes purely theoretical frameworks. We need nontheoretical, evocative narratives to make visible those parts of reality that are easily overlooked when we are focused on the practical and utilitarian side of existence.

The context in which the study was conducted was in Iranian retail specialty stores. Findings: The results revealed for the first time the impact of religiosity on ethical behavior of the seller, a key entity in the buyer-seller dyad, that had been virtually ignored in extant empirical work. Research limitations/implications: The study focused solely on retail salespeople in Iran. Future research should examine the religiosity-ethical behavior nexus using other kinds of sales personnel and those practicing other kinds of religion than the Shia Muslim faith investigated here. The investigation examined the association between religiosity and ethical behavior. Future work could include additional measures of religion (e.g. religious orientation) as well other individual, cultural, and organizational factors that may have an influence on salespeople's ethical conduct. Practical implications: Sales managers should try to convince salespeople to behave ethically. Also, sales managers should not establish unachievable sales objectives for salespeople and try to employ more religious individuals as salespeople. Multinational corporations (MNCs) should treat Shia Muslim salespersons with the utmost of respect, relying on their word. Similarly, MNCs should incorporate ethical guidelines into their training classes in order to be able to communicate conveniently with local salespeople and persuade them to act more ethically.

This comparative study aims to compare the seriousness of the old well-known vulnerabilities that may still exist with lower possibility of happening with that of new technologies like cloud computing with Mobility access. Cloud computing is a new structure of IT that is becoming the main part of the new model of business environment. However, issues regarding such new hype of technology do not come without obstacles. These issues have to be addressed before full acceptability of cloud services in a globalized business environment. Businesses need to be aware of issues of concerns before joining the cloud services. This paper also highlights these issues and shows the comparison table to help businesses with appropriate decision-making when joining the cloud.Practical implications – Learning from history, one can conclude the current risk factor in dealing with new technology like cloud computing. Businesses can realize that decision to join the cloud requires thinking about the issues mentioned in this paper and identifying the most vulnerability types to try to avoid them.Findings – After surveying the historical background of IT systems and emerged vulnerabilities as well as reviewing the common malicious types of system vulnerabilities, this paper identifies 22 different types of vulnerability categorized in eight different categories. This comparative study explores amount of possible vulnerabilities in new technology like cloud computing services. Specific issues for cloud computing were also explored and a similar comparative study was developed on these issues. The result of the comparative study between all types of vulnerabilities since the start of IT system development till today’s technology of cloud computing, shows that the highest percentage vulnerability category was the one related to mobility access as mobile applications/systems are relatively newly emerged and do not have a matured security solution(s).Originality/value – Anew comparative study and new classification of vulnerabilities demonstrated with risk analysis using simple scoring technique.Design/methodology/approach – A historical review of emerged vulnerabilities as IT systems evolved was conducted, then these vulnerabilities were categorized into eight different categories, each of which composed of multiple vulnerability types. Simple scoring techniques were used to build a “risk” analysis table where each vulnerability type was given a score based on availability of matured solution and the likeliness of happening, then in case of vulnerability type, another score was used to derive the impact of such vulnerability. The resulted weighted score can be derived from the multiplication of likeliness to happen score with that of its impact in case it did happen. Percentage of seriousness represented by the percentage of the derived weighted score of each of the vulnerabilities can then be concluded.

One thousand top level managers of Icelandic firms were approached and asked a number of questions aimed at establishing their view on the relationship between ethics education and the role of business schools in forming and developing business ethics education. Icelandic businesses were badly hurt by the 2008 crisis, and therefore Iceland provides an interesting foundation for an empirical study of this sort as the aftermath of the crisis has encouraged managers to consciously reflect on the way their business was and should be conducted. Based on the results of the survey, a few main themes have developed. First, it appears that according to practicing managers, business schools should not be held responsible for employees' unethical behavior. Nevertheless, managers believe that business schools should assist future employees in understanding ethics by including business ethics in teaching curricula. Second, managers believe that the workplace is not where ethics are learned, while also insisting that former students should already have strong ethical standards when entering the workplace. Third, managers call for business schools not only to contribute more to influencing students' ethical standards, but also to reshape the knowledge and capabilities of practicing managers through re-training and continuous education. Based on the results of the study, the article also offers some recommendations on how to begin reformulating the approach to business ethics education in Iceland, and perhaps elsewhere. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business schools; Ethics; Higher education; Iceland",

The strategy of this paper is to distinguish between a principle of organization that fosters participation (type I democracy) and a principle of legitimation that draws on consent (type II democracy). Based on this distinction, we highlight conceptual shortcomings of the literature on stakeholder democracy. We demonstrate that parts of the literature tend to confound ends with means. Many approaches employ type I democracy notions of participation and often take for granted that this also improves type II democratic legitimation. We hold this to be a mistake. We provide examples of the ambiguity of organizational procedures and show that under some circumstances a decrease in the degree of participation may actually increase legitimation because a governance structure that results in higher productivity can provide higher benefits for all parties involved, serve their interests and therefore meet their agreement. Less type I democracy may mean more type II democracy. We believe this to be an important insight for judging (and further improving) the legitimacy of both capitalistic firms and competitive markets. © 2014 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Consent; Constitutional economics; Democracy; Legitimacy; Participation; Stakeholder theory",

Specifically, we argue that effective relationship repair is dependent on the parties' reciprocal concern for others' viewpoints and collective engagement in the justice repair process. This approach enhances our understanding of the interdependency between justice and reconciliation/reintegration, while also providing theoretical insight into the processes underlying restorative conferencing, innovations that promise to help managers heal damaged organizational bonds. © 2014 Business Ethics Quarterly.","Justice repair; Reconciliation; Reintegration; Relationship repair; Restorative justice; Workplace transgressions",

However, beyond offenders and victims, reintegration depends on the views of organizational peers and their desire to interact with these parties. In two studies, we demonstrated that offender amends and victim forgiveness interact to predict peer reintegrative outcomes. We found evidence of backlash against unforgiving victims: Peers wanted to work the least with victims who rejected appropriate amends, thus penalizing them for their failure to contribute to the restoration process. This backlash effect was due to decreased liking of the victim and the perceived failure to repair the offender-victim relationship. These findings demonstrate that peers expect both offenders and victims to do their part to achieve reconciliation following transgression, and both may suffer the consequences of failing to meet peer expectations.

I begin by outlining the notion of a practice, before turning to Moore's attempt to provide a MacIntyrean account of corporate governance. I argue that Moore's attempt is mismatched with MacIntyre's account of moral education. Because the notion of practices resists general application I go on to argue that a negative application, which focuses on regulation, is more plausible. Large-scale regulation, usually thought antithetical to MacIntyre's advocacy of small-scale politics, has the potential to facilitate practice-based work and reveals that MacIntyre's own work can be used against his pessimism about the modern order. Furthermore, the conception of regulation I defend can show us how management is more amenable to ethical understanding than MacIntyre's work is often taken to imply. © 2014 Business Ethics Quarterly.","MacIntyre; Management; Practices; Regulation; Virtue-ethics",

Specifically the paper investigated the interaction of learning styles with ethics education and the ethical climate to influence the likelihood of engaging in ethical behavior. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from two groups of students – those who had completed a business ethics course and those who had not completed a business ethics course. The sample consisted of 180 undergraduate students at a private university in the USA. Data were analyzed using regression analysis to test the hypotheses. A scenario-based measure of the likelihood of engaging in ethical behavior was developed and implemented in the study. Findings – Both ethics education and ethical climate had a direct impact on a student’s likelihood of engaging in ethical behavior. The interaction between learning style and business ethics class significantly impacted experiential learners’ likelihood of engaging in ethical behaviors. Results for non-experiential learners as relates to ethical climate were non-significant, but ad hoc analysis indicates ethical climate significantly impacted likelihood to engage in ethical behaviors.

This link is an important, but still unclear, subject. Design/methodology/approach: Multivariate measures of sustainable supply chain performance and companies’ FP are used for Granger causality tests on a large, diverse sample of 3,900 companies in a time frame of eight years (2004-2011). Findings: Results indicate general bidirectional causality between sustainable supply chain performance and companies’ margins and revenue. However, the link between firms’ profitability and sustainable supply chain performance is unidirectional. In addition, the recent financial crisis altered this link between the studied constructs. Finally, a wide diversity in relationship patterns between sustainable supply chain performance and companies’ FP emerges when the full sample is divided into different geographical regions and economic sectors as specified by the Global Industry Classification Standard system. Practical implications: This research makes recommendations for improving several processes, such as stakeholder evaluation of the sustainable supply chain performance of companies worldwide and manager testing of environmental policy outcomes.

We propose that a fairness approach is more effective in attracting, retaining, and motivating reciprocal stakeholders to create value, while an arms-length approach is more effective in motivating self-regarding stakeholders and in attracting and retaining self-regarding stakeholders with high bargaining power.

Many corporations incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on a cross-sectional study of 113 companies from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ. We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/ or mission statement and strategic alliances fostered with non-governmental organizations are positively associated with SRQ. This study contributes to strengthening the understanding, promoting discussion on the state of sustainability reporting in the Asia-Pacific context and laying a solid foundation for more aggressive efforts to enhance SRQ. The study identifies the significant drivers currently associated with SRQ. The weak role of the board of directors in upholding the sustainable development agenda through the reporting process is highlighted.

This coincided with the rise of neoclassical economics that placed shareholdersabove other stakeholders. As evolving societal demands have forced businesses to consider business ethics, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability in their performance, and as AACSB has added these learning objectives, business schools have reactively responded by adding new courses to their existing curricula. However, these ""saddle-bag"" approaches do not integrate the topics into the core functional areas of business.

However, the tendency to explore business-conflict linkage largely from a business perspective and to see conflict as an ""incidence"" that business has to respond to, as opposed to a ""dynamic process"" that is a function of the breakdown of stakeholder relationship, limits our understanding of the relationship between business and conflict.

It summarizes the main objective of this book which is to examine the trends in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability in developing and emerging economies.Methodology/approach: This chapter reviews the extant literature and chapters and offers conceptual development.Findings: Discussion on CSR and sustainability concepts is growing in developing countries, and many stakeholders including businesses, governments, and universities are working toward achieving sustainability. In addition, it is well documented that multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in developing economies contribute significantly to job creation, growth and development, and poverty alleviation. However, when compared to developed countries there is a general perception that companies, in particular MNEs, do not pay much attention to CSR and sustainability issues. The lack of sophisticated institutional developments and capability in many developing economies compound the situation. Thus, business CSR and sustainability practices play a major role in improving stakeholder relationships.Practical and social implications: This chapter suggests that in order for developing and emerging economies to move forward and achieve the gains from globalization; businesses, governments, and other stakeholders should work together to benefit from the various initiatives on CSR and sustainability jointly put together for the betterment of the citizens and a prosperous economy.Originality/value: This chapter contributes to the debate on trends in CSR and sustainability in developing/emerging economies by critically examines what the notions really mean in developing and emerging economies. It emphasizes that CSR and sustainability mean contributing to the well-being of citizens and respond positively to various stakeholder demands by improving the host countries and communities through participation in economic progress, social well-being, improvement in environmental practices, and involvement in citizens' empowerment and institutional building.

The results confirm the multidimensionality of tax evasion attitudes. Idealism was negatively related to self-interest tax evasion attitudes while relativism was positively related to such attitudes. Idealism was also positively related to tax evasion attitudes stemming from concerns about the justice of the tax system. Idealists in a weak tax environment seemingly go through a cognitive reframing process where they recognize that the tax system is unfair, and accordingly tax evasion is a way to serve a different moral absolute, that is of equity, rather than another different moral absolute, which is fulfilling obligations to governments. The results are also explained in light of the suggested low moral intensity of tax evasion among respondents. Policy implications are presented. © 2014 The Authors.

Yet, even in circumstances in which layoffs qualify as ""necessary evils,"" morality demands that employers respect the dignity of those whose employment is involuntarily terminated.

ICT is the technology required for information processing which facilitates data processing, information sharing, communication, searching and selection. This paper concentrates on the Abernathy and Clark model and its usefulness in applying ICT as innovative in managing ST. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was administered to destination managers and to eTourism experts. Destination managers were selected as they were identified as the person responsible for the overall management of a Destination Management Organisation. eTourism experts were identified as someone who possesses special expertise, knowledge and skills on ICT applications to tourism and offered expertise on which ranged from such areas as electronic distribution, recommender systems, user-generated content, online communities, mobile technology, technology acceptance, tourism networks and Web 2.0. This was followed by semi-structured interviews. Findings: These ICT tools were found to be innovative for information management and distribution for critical decision-making. Innovation was fostered through the use of ICT for ST by leading to a better understanding of the tourism product, monitoring, measuring and evaluating, forecasting trends, developing partnerships and engaging and supporting stakeholder relationships. ICT would provide novel ways of approaching marketing, energy monitoring, waste management, and communication for destinations.

To capture the distinct nature of this global focus, researchers have developed a three-generation CSR typology. In this paper, we first evaluate the usefulness of this typology for understanding corporate approaches to CSR by examining how several companies position themselves thematically in CEO introductions to sustainability reports. On the basis of this, we then evaluate the practical value of this typology for assisting those who work with CSR strategy. The analysis revealed expressions of all three CSR generations, with third-generation thinking being apparent, but not dominant. It also verified that the three-generation CSR typology can be an instructive means of both evaluating as well as framing a company's approach to sustainability, though with modifications. On the basis of the identified strengths and weaknesses of the typology, we develop a practitioner-focused, three-tiered model that can strategically guide the development of CSR programs. © 2014 The Authors.

Ultimately, processing plants were closed, employees laid off, school lunch programs were changed to exclude LFTB from their menus, and large retailers such as Costco and Walmart refused to sell products containing LFTB. Calls for mandatory labeling were proposed in Congress, the argument being that consumers had a right to know what was in the beef they were purchasing and feeding their families. Dubbed ""pink slime"" by its critics, LFTB is treated, processed beef renderings that are derived from trimmings that would otherwise be discarded or used for some inferior purpose such as animal food.

Although there are previous studies that have looked at the influence of various pressures in influencing firms' environmental strategies, our study provides a more holistic analysis considering a variety of such pressures in a single framework. We discuss a research study to analyze how pressures from internal and external stakeholders of a firm, economic pressures, environmental regulations, and pressures of environmental compliance have affected environmental performance of firms using data collected from manufacturing firms in the United Kingdom. We have found that internal stakeholders provide the greatest impact in shaping environmental performance of firms, closely followed by economic pressures, environmental regulations, and external stakeholders in that order.

Findings: Consumers are progressively more active and the traditional supplier role of controlling consumers is less viable. The case examples show the variety of ways in which companies may adopt a new role in relation to customers and the market. The paper argues that adapting to this role change needs to take place at the highest level in the company and is the way to reinvent marketing strategy. This also necessitates marketing employing unconventional methodologies and relevant theory to address the complexity and ambiguity of current markets.

But while corporations are ostensibly regulated by citizens through their governments, the firms in turn regulate many aspects of social and political life for individuals beyond their own employees and the communities that support them. Corporations are endowed with many of the same rights as citizens, such as freedom of speech, but are not themselves typically constituted around ideals of national belonging and democracy. In the wake of the global financial collapse of 2008, the question of what relationship corporations should have to governing institutions has only increased in urgency. As a democratically sanctioned social institution, should a corporation operate primarily toward profit accumulation or should its proper goal be to provision society with needed goods and services? Corporations and Citizenship addresses the role of modern for-profit corporations as a distinctive kind of social formation within democratic national states. Scholars of legal studies, business ethics, politics, history, and anthropology bring their perspectives to bear on particular case studies, such as Enron and Wall Street, as well as broader issues of belonging, social responsibility, for-profit higher education, and regulation.

Two years after a single training session, we find sustained, positive effects on indicators of an ethical organizational culture (observed unethical behavior, intentions to behave ethically, perceptions of organizational efficacy in managing ethics, and the firm's normative structure). While espoused organizational values also rose in importance post-training, the boost dissipated after the second year which suggests perceptions of values are not driving sustained behavioral improvements.

Design/methodology/approach – An example of mapping and identifying expectations is presented as a result of a thematic analysis of qualitative interview data, collected from six stakeholder groups of the media industry. Findings – Expectation types and gaps can be identified through the use of systematic expectation mapping, conceptualized in this paper as “expectation management.” Expectation management analyzes expectation types and priorities, and it assists in crafting response strategies. Four types of expectations (must, will, should, and could) were identified in an empirical study of the media industry.

Practical implications – Organizations can gain strategic advantages by using expectation management to deepen communication management. New skills and processes may be needed to enable communication professionals to analyze and understand the core level of expectations. Social implications – Expectation management can help organizations respond to current societal pressures and help publics voice their concerns toward organizations.

My goal is not to defend or reject the economic case for sweatshops. Instead, proceeding from a broadly pluralist understanding of value, I make and defend a number of claims concerning the ethical relevance of economic analysis for values that different agents utilize to evaluate sweatshops. My arguments give special attention to a series of recent articles by Benjamin Powell and Matt Zwolinski, which represent the latest and best defense of the economic case for sweatshops. In the process, I challenge Zwolinski's ""non-worseness claim"" (NWC), and the idea that opposition to sweatshop wages and working conditions fails to respect that the autonomy of would-be sweatshop workers. Ultimately, I conclude that even if the economic case for sweatshops rests on a solid empirical foundation, agents possess good reason to advocate for better wages and working conditions for sweatshop workers, and to prefer less exploitative or coercive relationships.

The factor structure was examined and cross-validated with two randomly split samples. Moreover, multigroup confirmatory factor analyses results indicated measurement and structural invariance of the IFCS between men and women. The construct validity of the IFCS was supported by its associations with life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect, social connection with mainstream society, academic stress, and two forms of discrimination (i.e., racial/national and language) in the expected directions. Moreover, the IFCS total score and four subscale scores added significant incremental variance in predicting life satisfaction over and above positive and negative affect. The initial psychometric evaluation indicates that the IFCS is a promising measure that could be further used to assess the international friendliness of university campuses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Campus climate; Factor analysis; International students; Psychometric evaluation; Scale development",

This approach builds on a rational model of decision making and emphasizes moral awareness and moral judgment, encouraging students to describe moral dilemmas and assess the consequences of various responses. Unfortunately, moral awareness and moral judgment do not necessarily lead to moral action; organizational variables and social influences frequently trigger emotions such as fear, anxiety or desire, motivating employees to act in ways that they know are wrong. A review of ethics education articles and a sampling of business textbooks and learning objectives indicate that attention to the role of social influence in ethical decision making is limited in business classrooms. The contribution of this article is to heighten the awareness of this deficiency among business faculty and offer a set of instructional strategies that can be used to expand the current use of case studies across the business curriculum so that our students will recognize and respond ethically to social influence tactics. © The Author(s) 2013.","business ethics; social influence; whistle-blowing; workplace ethics",

Interaction effects revealed that factors previously shown to influence the entrepreneurs' evaluations-investor value-add and investment track record-become largely contingent upon and often subjugated by investors' ethical reputation. Study two, a traditional between-subjects scenario experiment, revealed that when entrepreneurs develop their own perceptions about the ethicality of an investor's prior behaviors, the ethical dimension remains highly influential. Further, we find that as the consequences of rejecting funding become more severe (e.g., possible bankruptcy), entrepreneurs become increasingly willing to partner with unethical investors.

In particular, using firm-level Buddhism data, measured as the number of Buddhist monasteries within a certain radius around Chinese listed firms’ registered addresses, this study provides strong evidence that Buddhism intensity is significantly negatively associated with tunneling. This finding is consistent with the view that Buddhism has important influence on corporate behavior and can serve as a set of social norms and/or an alternative mechanism to mitigate controlling shareholders’ unethical tunneling behavior. In addition, my findings also reveal that the negative association between Buddhism intensity and tunneling is attenuated for firms that have high analyst coverage.

Notable researchers Tannen and Gilligan demonstrated gender difference while subsequent researchers indicate that gender differences are becoming more neutralized. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes the gender demographic and intercultural influences on ethical decision-making by undergraduate students from New Zealand and the USA through four scenarios. Findings: Overall for the USA and New Zealand, this research demonstrates this split as well, since two scenarios showed significance while two did not. The two that demonstrated a significance dealt with personnel issues and a past client relationship. These two scenarios suggested that a relationship orientation and relativistic nature among women may influence their decision making. The two scenarios without significance were less relationship oriented, involving dealing with a customer (a stranger) and a subordinate (implying a professional supervisory responsibility). In addition, the neutrality exhibited in the latter two scenarios may reflect Tannen's illustration that there is a cross-gender influence on decision making. With respect to the geographic location, the USA, when compared with New Zealand, and the gender demographics, only the USA reported significant differences for two scenarios.

Economic, management, and organizational theories and ideas have a large impact on the way we think of ourselves, and we act accordingly. By making a radical departure from the ontological assumptions, this paper proposes a shifting of the current paradigm in terms of how we theorize about man. In order to do this, we analyze the ontological level of the relationship between the idea of happiness and the concept of man from medieval scholastics, and the relationship between the idea of happiness and functionalism in social science. We first prove the formal equivalence between the structures of human choice as described in the qq. 6-21 Prima Secundae of the Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas, and the model of problem-solving behavior as conceptualized in popular management models.

Design/methodology/approach: To do this, the extent to which and how blat is used by graduates to find a job in the city of Mykolayiv in Ukraine is analysed through 85 face-to-face structured interviews with those who in the past seven years have sought employment after graduating from university. Findings: The finding is that blat is widely used by graduates to find a job. However, contrary to the existing literature which suggests that blat has become commodified in post-Soviet market societies with monetary payment being requested by and given to personal connections ""pulling strings"", no evidence is found that this is the case. Instead, this remains a non-monetised form of friendly help by and for close social relations, akin to the Soviet era, and is viewed in a positive or neutral manner by participants even though its consequences can be to circumvent meritocratic formal recruitment procedures and foster nepotism and cronyism. Research limitations/implications: This study of blat is limited to analysing graduate recruitment in one city in Ukraine. Broader empirical research on the contemporary role of blat in this and other spheres in post-Soviet societies and beyond is now required so as to develop a more nuanced context-bound understanding of both the positive and negative facets of this social practice in contemporary societies.

This article explores the view that compromises arise from negotiations but from ethical predicaments as well. For this reason, I distinguish between strategic and moral compromises. Both managers and employees are individual moral agents who have to confront the possibility of unpalatable and even disgusting compromises, so that they are forced to put their integrity into risk in certain compromise situations. However, I shall argue for the possibility of palatable moral compromises. The guidelines to cope with those situations and to identify the unpalatable compromises are based on J. S. Mill's moral philosophy. Mill suggested that half-measures passed in Parliament must have certain key elements to be morally acceptable. I make use of this doctrine to put forward compromise guidelines in the form of a set of hallmarks, internal and external elements of palatable compromises.

The problem is that this kind of rent and rent seeking, when they fail to deliver desirable outcomes, are better described as government failure. I suggest that this means we will have to expand Heath's framework to a market and government failures approach. I then try to defuse objections that as a government failure, rent seeking may not appear relevant to what managers ought to do. Solving this conceptual issue will also give us an excuse to revisit a separate conceptual issue: the normatively thick conception of ""rent"" and rent seeking behavior that some use. This normatively thick conception is problematic, I argue, and I offer the beginnings of a novel, normatively neutral conception that is useful for our purposes in making the ethics of rent and rent seeking behavior more than a merely trivial exercise. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Beyond-compliance obligations; Business Ethics; Market failure; Market failures approach; Regulation; Rent seeking; Self-regulation; Stakeholder theory",

Over the last decade it has been argued that positive duties also befall commercial agents, at least when confronted with large scale public problems and when governments fail. The argument that enterprises have positive duties is often grounded in the political nature of commercial life. It is argued that agents must sometimes take over governmental responsibilities. The German republican tradition argues along these lines as does Nien-Hé Hsieh. Agents in commercial life are bound by positive duties because at some point they become citizens that must take on the responsibilities of the state. In this paper we leave undisputed the claim that corporations must acknowledge positive duties. However, we demonstrate that the political grounding fails, at least in the sense that this theory insufficiently acknowledges a long standing liberal tradition that vindicates apolitical markets and clear borderlines between politics and economics. We carve out an alternative route to the grounding of one specific positive duty-the duty to further justice. Our argument is based on the moral nature of commercial agents (including corporations) and tries to demonstrate that the duty to further justice ensues from liberalism. Taking a Kantian perspective, it conceptualizes the duty to further justice as a moral duty, orientated toward the political domain. It is grounded in the obligation to attain moral autonomy in the civil condition. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Duty of assistance; Duty to further justice; Kant; Politicization; Republicanism; Ruggie",

The reluctance of managers to use moral arguments in business is further accentuated in the now common argument presented as a neutral fact that the company must always prioritise shareholder value. These and other commercial aims are seen as an objective reality in business, whilst questions about sustainability, environmental problems or fair trade are seen as emotional or moral ones; a phenomenon described as 'moral muteness'. This research explores whether this moral muteness is an Anglo-American phenomenon and/or whether managers in other countries - in this case Germany - might express themselves in a different way. The focus is on moral arguments around environmental sustainability and the implications of this study for cross-cultural management. This article is based on a qualitative, comparative cross-cultural study of British and German managers in the food retail and energy sectors. In line with the studies mentioned above, British managers placed a strong emphasis on their moral neutrality. In contrast, German managers tended to use moral arguments when discussing corporate greening, often giving such arguments more weight than financial arguments. Overall, the study suggests that the moral muteness of managers is a British phenomenon and quite distinct from the German approach. The article ends in a short exploration of how this understanding can help managers better manage people, organisations and change across cultures. © The Author(s) 2014.","business ethics; cross-cultural; cross-national; environmental sustainability; Moral muteness; moral reasoning",

A main question that is also given substantial attention in the business ethics literature-even more so in the wake of the recent financial crisis-is whether increasing levels of executive compensation can be justified from an ethical point of view. Also, the relationship of executive compensation to instances of unethical behavior or outcomes has received considerable attention. The purpose of this paper is to explore the social, ecological, and existential costs of economic incentives, by discussing how relying on increasing levels of executive compensation may have an adverse effect on managerial performance in a broad sense. Specifically, we argue that one-dimensional economic incentives may destroy existential, social, and systemic values that influence the manager's commitment to ensure responsible business conduct, and have negative spillover effects that may reduce the manager's performance. There are well-documented findings that demonstrate that reliance on sources of extrinsic motivation (such as economic incentives) may displace intrinsic motivation. Our perspective is a holistic one, in the sense that we will explore the influence of sources of extrinsic motivation on the manager's intrinsic commitment to different types of values. We will in particular investigate how it may influence the manager's ethical reflection and behavior or lack thereof. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Executive compensation; Holistic perspective; Incentives; Motivation; Value-dimensions of managerial performance",

This paper reports the findings of a systematic analysis of the international research evidence that supports claims for a wider social role for volunteer sports coaches. The analysis suggests that the evidence base for such claims is weak, lacking robustness, rigour, and a clear theoretical foundation. If, therefore, there are growing expectations about the individual and community benefits that volunteer sports coaches can deliver through sports activities, we argue that it is imperative to understand more about the needs, motivations, and priorities of this large volunteer workforce.

These spaces often host socio-ecological formations and functions that are both irregular and unexpected in urban settings, rendered invisible by the disciplining of modern Western aesthetic expectations concerning what is desirable and appropriate in cities. These lands may be vacant, but they are not uninhabited. They enable forms of inhabitation that disrupt the logic of urban development and provide social and ecological prospects otherwise unavailable in cities. The concept of terrain vague is engaged in this paper to probe vacant lands as interstitial spaces that are peripheral to mainstream, dominant urban experiences in Paris, France. The case of the Petite Ceinture railway encircling Paris is explored as an outstanding example of terrain that is rendered physically, socially and ecologically invisible yet provides astounding ecological connectivity and relatively undisturbed habitat for countless species in the midst of one of the world's cultural capitals. It enables alternate experiences of urbanity for many people, including different types of mobility, novel aesthetic encounters, and social engagement outside urban surveillance infrastructure. As the Petite Ceinture provides unique home for wildlife populations such as mid-size mammals and rare bat colonies, it also hosts undocumented migrant groups, assemblages of youth, urban flaneurs, homeless labourers, artists, and groups conducting prohibited activities. These types of inhabitations are possible because the Petite Ceinture has been fully decommissioned since 1993, unmanaged and left largely to successional processes. This paper investigates terrain vague as a critical dimension of urban sustainability and ends by suggesting key ways that the conceptual and material underpinnings of terrain vague could be channeled through progressive urban planning and design. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Abandoned railway; Paris; Urban sustainability; Vacancy","environmental protection; sustainability; terrain; urban design; urban development; urban planning; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; Mammalia"

Design/methodology/approach – The authors link current debates about integrated reporting to prior research on the contested politics of social and environmental reporting, and critiques of the dominance of business case framings. The authors introduce research from science and technology studies that seeks to broaden out and open up appraisal methods and engagement processes in ways that highlight divergent framings and politically contentious issues, in an effort to develop empowering designs for sustainability. The authors demonstrate the strong resonance between this work and calls for the development of dialogic/polylogic accountings that take pluralism seriously by addressing constituencies and perspectives currently marginalized in mainstream accounting. The authors draw and build on both literatures to critically reflect on the International Integrated Reporting Council’s (IIRC, 2011, 2012a, b, 2013a, b) advocacy of a business case approach to integrated reporting as an innovation that can contribute to sustainability transitions. Findings – The authors argue that integrated reporting, as conceived by the IIRC, provides a very limited and one-sided approach to assessing and reporting on sustainability issues.While the business case framing on which it rests might assist in extending the range of phenomena accounted for in organizational reports, it remains an ideologically closed approach that is more likely to reinforce rather than encourage critical reflection on “business as usual” practices. Recognizing that the meaning and design of integrated reporting are still far from stabilized, the authors also illustrate more enabling possibilities aimed at identifying and engaging diverse socio-political perspectives. Practical implications – Science and technology studies research on the need to broaden out and open up appraisal methods, together with proposals for dialogic/polylogic accountings, facilitates a critical, nuanced discussion of the value of integrated reporting as a change initiative that might foster transitions to more sustainable business practices. Originality/value – The authors link ideas and findings from science and technology studies with literature on dialogic/polylogic accountings to engage current debates around the merits of integrated reporting as a change initiative that can contribute to sustainability. This paper advances understanding of the role of accounting in sustainability transitions in three main ways: first, it takes discussion of accounting change beyond the organizational level, where much professional and academic literature is currently focussed, and extends existing critiques of business case approaches to social and environmental reporting; second, it emphasizes the political and power-laden nature of appraisal processes, dimensions that are under-scrutinized in existing accounting literature; and third, it introduces a novel framework that enables evaluation of individual disclosure initiatives such as integrated reporting without losing sight of the big picture of sustainability challenges. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Dialogic/polylogic accountings; Integrated reporting; Social and environmental accounting; Sustainability",

Drawing on the recent CSR literature and related theories, including stakeholder theory and institutional theory, propositions and a conceptual framework are developed and presented. The framework integrates BE and IB concepts on the different dimensions of CSR and provides a theoretical derived explanation of the process for strategic adoption of global through to more local CSR strategies by MNE subsidiaries to build legitimacy in an emerging market context.

The paper highlights the disregard for externalities as a fundamental obstacle to sustainable reporting and proposes taxation designs to recognise the costs associated with externalities as the basis for equitable reporting, pricing and sustainable business practices. Design/methodology/approach: The approach taken uses Smith's (1776) tenets of a good tax, to consider characteristics of taxation that may be harnessed for financial reporting, valuation, economic substance and legal form. Findings: The findings reveal a case for further examination of the efficacy of taxation, alongside a full-cost accounting approach, to benefit sustainable reporting. Research limitations/implications: The implications of the research are a possible whole reappraisal of costs and prices to recognise the sustainability dimension and place it at the heart of the corporate agenda. The limitations arise from contestable valuation of sustainable matters, arising from a lack of an agreed theoretical framework.

In particular, we are not entitled simply to assume that fictive creativity will bolster existing norms or engender virtues. On the contrary, in some cases, fiction reveals just how difficult it is to apply norms or to identify the virtuous course of action, given that we often do not have an accurate understanding of what is going on in an organizational or business setting, much less a cogent grasp on whether the behavior is right and good.

This paper reports on a study that examined attitudes towards the acceptability of workplace behaviour that might be considered unethical. Graduate business students at an Australian university (n = 234) were asked to indicate the ethicality of 17 different behaviours, drawn from the business ethics literature. Exploratory factor analysis identified distinct factors, consisting of misuse of company resources, self-serving deceit, and the giving or receiving favours for personal gain. The derived factor structure was then tested with confirmatory factor analysis. Descriptive statistics indicated that misuse was considered less unethical than exchanging favours for personal gain.

These funds are influential in defining SRI principles, and through shareholder activism they influence broader standards on corporate social responsibility and firm sustainability.

Traditionally, corporate governance reform has taken a structural approach, tightening the rules around the number of independent directors required on boards and committees and fine-tuning the definition of independence. However, such an approach has failed to achieve effective corporate governance. Moreover, this approach is informed by the arguably discredited assumption that individuals are rational self-interest utility maximizers. This conceptual paper questions why corporate governance scholars and regulators remain uncritical of this assumption and suggests an approach to reform inspired by a different view of human nature. Indeed, incorporating an actor-based approach to reform into existing structures may better achieve effective corporate governance while addressing an unjustified adherence to this flawed assumption. © 2014 The Authors.

We provide three reasons for a firm to focus CSR initiatives on core competencies: to reap economies of scale and scope in building company-wide knowledge and skills; to promote worker productivity that is integral to the firm; and to exploit the fixed costs associated with managing workers.

The evidence for this rests on anecdotes about people's mental states, and customers and server's intuitions about duties that would arise were a customer unable to tip his server. The promise is a speech act that is implicit in ordering food. The speech act must be matched by the server's uptake, which is implicit in her taking the order. The promise argument rests on an actual promise and not a merely hypothetical promise. If there is such a duty, then in the absence of an explicit content, its content is likely set by convention. The convention is that customers tip 15-20%. Thus, customers have a duty to tip servers 15-20%. Other purported moral considerations do not ground this duty.

A plurality of private standards, codes of conduct and quality assurance schemes currently developed particularly, though not exclusively, by TNCs replace traditional intergovernmental regimes in addressing profound global environmental and socio-economic challenges ranging from forest deforestation, fisheries depletion, climate change, to labor and human rights concerns. While this trend has produced a heated debate in science and politics, surprisingly little attention has been paid on the effects of private governance on questions of distribution and justice. This is highly problematic. At the beginning of the twenty-first century global inequalities are greater than ever before, while rapid economic, social, political, and environmental changes threaten to further derail sustainable development and humanitarian objectives. If private governance creates or intensifies some of the pressing global inequalities (e.g., food security), and alleviates others (e.g., environmental degradation), from a business ethics perspective, we need to know which aspects need to be strengthened and where appropriate interventions are necessary and desirable. This paper proposes a framework to examine and classify the distributive outcomes of private governance institutions through the lenses of one particular approach to distributive justice, the capability approach. Empirically, it focuses on agrifood one area where the controversy regarding the distributive concerns of private governance are particularly pronounced. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agrifood; Capabilities approach; Governance; Private standards; Sustainability",

We then develop a three-level Fair Trade awareness Model that illustrates both the existing and desired levels of understanding with regard to Fair Trade awareness. © 2014 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Where the triple bottom line calls on companies to weigh effects on stakeholders and the environment alongside profit, in practice in many cases, sustainability has been perverted to represent sustainable profits. In these cases, environmental impact and effects on people are only important insofar as they positively contribute to a firm's future profits. It is not only practitioners who have often espoused this misappropriated view of sustainability but also academics have lent credibility to this view. In this work, we start by criticizing the often espoused current view of sustainability and remind academics of their responsibility to adapt a more critical view of this narrow focus. We provide examples that show how the current system of capitalism has resulted in outcomes for people and the environment that are patently unacceptable. Reasons are given as to why there is much hesitation to change the status quo. We then call on academics to reexamine what the role of businesses should be within society, what obligations business and corporations should have in society, and how we can encourage meaningful change that results in a better world for future generations. © 2014 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

The author draws lessons from the four stories and highlight key challenges in decision making – developing spiritual discernment to support logic based and emotion-laden decision making.Findings – Allowing crisis to drive decisions, failing to recognize and account for the biases and attachments, and not developing good role clarity keep leaders from making the decisions they need to, from a place of ethical clarity. The subtle but essential spirit of ethical decision making is discernment and quality of discernment increases when leaders develop “viveka” or discrimination capability and use it regularly.Research limitations/implications – It is important to remember that developing skills in using viveka in discernment suggested in this paper requires “unlearning” some of the beliefs and practices that served leaders in the past. This framework might be thought provoking and rich conceptually but only action and practice using this framework with awareness makes managers wise leaders.Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to help leaders to reflect on how to make difficult decisions by developing practical wisdom based on Indian traditions. In complex scenarios, when leaders are is crisis, they often tend to rush into decisions without proper reflection, rely too heavily on data and analytics, and demonstrate an inability to decide based on subtle, intangible and often very important elements like emotion, intuition and spiritual discernment. In this paper, the author discusses what it means to make wise decisions based on the Hindu concept of discrimination (viveka) – that is, the ability to perceive and make fine distinctions and also to notice and value quality which is very important part of spiritual discernment.Practical implications – This paper proposes a framework for making difficult decisions and has implications for developing managers and leaders who can make decisions with discernment. Especially in these days of complexity and turbulence, we need to develop people to resolve dilemmas wisely and effectively. The framework for developing discernment by using intuition, instinct and emotions along with data effectively can help leader using this framework make wise decisions. The stories of leadership success and failure in the Mahabharata serve to remind us that reactive or unreflective decision making are not the answer to rapid change and uncertainty. Yet, leaders need to be able to make sound decisions rapidly in a complex and changeable context by paying attention to both explicit and tacit factors. Stories open up other paths to cultivating this ability of paying attention to viveka that is at the root of spiritual discernment. With clear engagement with the role of leader; the will to detach from desired outcomes; and a stance of courage, humility and ethical clarity, we have the tools we need to manage accelerating complexity, whatever its source.Originality/value – Decision-making process is examined holistically – by bringing in recent developments in brain research along with stories and lessons from an ancient epic from India to recognize that making decisions is complex and important element that distinguishes wise leaders from smart leaders. This paper could help smart leaders gain ethical clarity by developing discernment integrating fine qualities of discrimination. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Cross-cultural management; Decision making; Globalization; Leadership; Mahabharata; Organizational behaviour; Wisdom",

Alternatively, Buddhist wisdom, applied to economic decision making, offers the opportunity for a well-lived life of purpose and meaning.Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins with an examination of the foundational elements of Buddhism and economics, then contrasts the paths (or models) constructed from these bases and the associated implications for happiness and well-being.Findings – The assumptions of Buddhism and economics regarding incessant wants, method of analytical inquiry, assignation of primary agency, and promotion of individual freedom, all bear striking similarities. Yet, despite these commonalities, the paths they undertake could not be more different. Specifically, their views and beliefs regarding consumption, work, and self-interest lead to radically different implications for how to live a well-lived life and how to organize economic society.Research limitations/implications – Business leaders should develop alternative business models that incorporate a broader range of values and ideals than those associated with traditional economic modeling.

When directed toward moral decision making, the authors believe this ability can help managers effectively respond to their ethical challenges and contribute to an organizational environment that supports ethical performance. Design/methodology/approach - After presenting insights from the literature on curiosity and establishing its relevance, the authors describe a specific experiential learning tool designed to cultivate moral curiosity in organizational settings. The authors conduct a field study using this process to explore how moral curiosity can be strengthened through experiential practice. Findings - Results from the field study suggest that engagement in balanced experiential inquiry, a process that asks managers to reflect on their salient ethical dilemmas and then engage in both individual and collective meaning making, positively influenced participants' curiosity toward moral decision making. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include challenges inherent to the field-study design, including lack of a control group and limited ability to predict long-term impacts of the intervention. Despite these concerns, the study has useful implications for managerial training and development. In particular, providing safe spaces where managers can discuss their ethical dilemmas is an important element of supporting their development into morally curious leaders who are interested in pursuing business ethics. Practical implications - Findings suggest that providing safe spaces where managers can discuss their ethical dilemmas is an important element of supporting their development into morally curious leaders who are interested in pursuing business ethics.

We select the 15-item love of money (LOM) construct—Factors Good, Evil (Affective), Budget (Behavioral), Achievement, and Power (Cognitive)—from the Money Ethic Scale and Factors Success and Centrality and two indicators—from the Materialism Scale. Based on our data collected from 330 university students in Czech Republic, we provide the following findings. First, our formative models are superior to our reflective models. Second, for the reflective model, money represents Power, Good, Achievement, and not Evil, in the context of materialism. Our formative model suggests that those who pursuit materialism cherish Achievement (vanity) but Budget their money poorly. Third, multi-group analyses illustrate that humanities students (62.4 % female) consider money as Evil and Budget their money poorly, while those in natural sciences (37.6 % female) do not. Further, men are obsessed with Achievement, whereas women do not Budget their money properly, suggesting reflective temptation for males and impulsive temptation for females.

The paper focusses on issues of motivation and creativity in a global and multi-cultural milieu. Business education is often viewed as fundamentally about rational and analytical thinking, but creativity and innovation are also central. Due to information technology and globalization, they may be even more fundamental to business success than ever before. Both educators and managers can benefit from thinking about creativity and innovation in this context, since both are responding to the same business trends, and developing the same people. Design/methodology/approach: Since business fundamentals should reflect business realities, global trends in information and communications technology and mass migration brought on by information and communications technology are explored, and their relevance to the imagination and creativity is developed. Educational innovations in motivation and aspirational capacity are explained, and their relevance to fundamental business education is postulated. Findings: Tapping into the imagination is a source of motivation and creativity. What would appear to be very minimal social-psychological interventions have had significant positive effects on educational achievement. Those same techniques may be useful in teaching the fundamentals of business, and may have the added benefit instilling of a holistic and ethical perspective on the part of students.

Design/methodology/approach - Recent graduated accounting students from selected Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business were asked to fill out a cross-sectional survey based on Victor and Cullen's Ethical Climate Questionnaire (ECQ) to determine whether a difference exists between the two groups' ethical perceptions. The nine hypotheses derived from the ECQ were tested using an independent sample t-test and Levene's test for the homogeneity of the variances between the two groups. Findings - Compared with graduates of the 120 credit program, 150 credit program graduates scored significantly higher in ethical perceptions on five domains: Company Profit, Friendship, Team Interest, Personal Morality, and Rules, when testing at a confidence level of 95 percent. The two groups were not significantly different in the domains of Self-Interest, Efficiency, Social Responsibility, or Laws.

This study is part of a growing body of research for teaching ethics within the accounting profession. Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need to study business ethics. Corporate scandals in the late 1990s and early this century led to a decline in the public's trust of the accounting profession. Since that time, the government, companies, and universities have attempted to rebuild that trust through a number of methods, such as passing laws requiring better regulation and more disclosure as well as requiring improved ethics education for future accountants.

Design/methodology/approach – By using longitudinal data from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the paper uses content analysis to compare and contrast toy recalls, product hazards and country of origin issues of 721 toy recalls in the US market between 1974 and 2008, covering 270 million recalled toys. Findings – Findings of this work reveal that most of the recalled toys were manufactured in China, although a wide variety of toy brands were designed in the USA. Major hazards of toy recalls included choking, lead poisoning, aspiration, fire/burn and other injuries. Research limitations/implications – The study relied on the CPSC’s data that seemed representative of the toy industry in the US market, but missed other markets of Europe and Asia.

We find a positive association between the level and change of CSR engagement and the level and change of analyst coverage after considering simultaneity and causality. Based on the first-difference approach, we further find that the change in analyst following from the previous year affects the change in CSR in the current period, whereas the change in CSR from the previous period does not influence the change in analyst following in the current period. Furthermore, we find that the change in CSR engagement as well as the interaction effect of changes in CSR and analyst coverage reduces the change of firm risk. When we examine the CSR strengths and concerns separately, analyst following does not significantly influence firms' CSR strength but CSR concern activities decreases significantly as firms have more analyst followings. We further find the mediating role of financial analysts between CSR concerns (but not CSR strengths) and firm risk. We maintain that analysts provide indirect but additional social pressure to the firms to eventually reduce their irresponsible activities. Taken together, we interpret these results to support the stakeholder theory-based conflict-resolution explanation that considers CSR engagement as a vehicle to reduce conflicts of interest between managers and noninvesting stakeholders but not the overinvestment hypothesis that views CSR as a waste of valuable resources at the cost of shareholders. © 2014 The Authors.

Indeed, much of the current literature concentrates on psychological or managerial aspects of whistleblowing while taking for granted this or that moral position or eschewing any normative commitment on the question. The purpose of this article is firstly to reemphasise the importance and complexity of the normative foundations of whistleblowing acts; and secondly, through a moral philosophical analysis of the component decisions that make up any act of whistleblowing, to contribute to a more balanced and less polarised treatment of the topic. It is argued that the polarisation of views on the topic is in part due to a failure to decompose the act of whistleblowing into a number of inevitable component moral decisions leading up to the act. It is furthermore argued on the basis of the analysis that it is impossible to state a priori as a matter of general principle that whistleblowing is always morally right (a good act) or morally wrong (a bad act). The article will close with a reflection on the degree to which the weighing up of good and bad in the act of whistleblowing differs sharply among cultures; and with a conjecture as to a possible relation to a people's history which may serve as a pointer to interesting future empirical research on the topic. © 2014 The Authors Business Ethics: A European Review © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,

Data were gathered from multiple sources, and interview transcriptions were returned to interviewees for clarification, accuracy, final proofreading and approval. Findings-The TBS model complements existing research by emphasising the importance of commitment to an overarching vision through corporate leadership assigning areas of strategic priority that respond to current and future environmental regulation and social needs. Research implications/limitations-Efforts aimed towards business sustainability and application of sustainable business practices in business networks include interfaces and interactions between involved stakeholders and sources. We argue that stakeholders and sources should be recognised as intertwined, where resources used in activities in a business network causing resource residuals may be recovered and reused by other actors in the business network.

Therefore, more and more of them incorporate environmental objectives in their business policies and strategies. The fulfilment of the environmental objectives requires the hotel to develop and implement environmentally sustainable business practices, as well as to implement reliable tools to assess environmental impact, of which environmental accounting and reporting are particularly emphasized. The purpose of this paper is to determine the development of hotel environmental accounting practices, based on previous research and literature review. Approach-This paper provides an overview of current research in the field of hotel environmental accounting and reporting, based on established knowledge about hotel environmental responsibility. The research has been done according to the review of articles in academic journals. Conclusions about the requirements for achieving hotel long-term sustainability have been drawn. Findings-Previous studies have shown that environmental accounting and reporting practice in hotel business is weaker when compared to other activities, and that most hotels still insufficiently use the abovementioned instruments of environmental management to reduce their environmental footprint and to improve their relationship with stakeholders. The paper draws conclusions about possible perspectives that environmental accounting has in ensuring hotel sustainability.

Research and experience show that tourism organisations need to search for alternative sources and innovative elements in order to improve their competitiveness. This can be done by forming a social-relationship-network in the field of tourism, which is an important factor in creating added value and innovation. There has to be a continuous pursuit of excellence and a socially responsible approach, starting from the idea, via development, and right through to project implementation. One of the beneficial methodologies for developing and expanding a level of tourism which is sustainable and enhances the totality of local and regional environments is a multi-stakeholder approach. The second part of this paper presents a case-study of ""Heritage trails through Dolenjska and Bela krajina in South East Slovenia "", in which sustainable rural development was pursued by using an integrated approach in terms of start-up, implementation and development. This initiative was supported by and benefitted from the notion of having a core of multiple stakeholders.","A multi-stakeholder approach; A socially responsible approach; Heritage trails Dolenjska and Bela krajina; Quest for excellence; Slovenia",

Today it is at a crossroads. On the one hand, the countries of the Maghreb-Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia-are struggling to recover their political equilibrium. On the other, they are unable to meet the socio-economic challenges facing them in a context of internationalizing trade and strong competition from the developing countries of Asia. However, the region has many assets that could enable it to find its place in the global economy, if a genuine effort of regional integration were undertaken. This is what Nadji Safir demonstrates here. He begins by stressing the limitations of the development policies pursued in the Maghreb and the region's shortcomings in terms of the ""social management of knowledge"". He goes on to outline the seven major sets of issues and constraints that are crucial to the future of the region, which he breaks down as follows: ideological and cultural; political and security-related; educational and scientific; social and economic; ecological and territorial; humanitarian and security-related; and political and geostrategic. On the basis of these issues and of the assets at the disposal of the countries of the Maghreb, Safir stresses that regional economic integration is an essential prerequisite for turning the area into a genuine growth hub rather than a crisis zone, and doing so at the regional and also, potentially, the international level.",,

Some authors have noted that social capital nevertheless has a dark side. There is a moral element to such a conceptualisation, yet there is scarce discussion of ethics within the social capital literature. In this paper ethical theory is applied to four traditions or approaches to economic social capital: neo-capitalism; network/reputation; neo-Tocquevellian; and development. Each is considered in detail and subject to ethical analysis by the application of utilitarianism, Kantianism, justice and rights, and ethic of care. Accordingly, the assumption that social capital is either value-neutral or a force for good is critiqued, and a framework for understanding social capital from an ethics perspective is presented. © 2013 The Author.",,

The sunk-cost fallacy occurs when prior investments instead of future returns influence decisions about future investments. When making decisions about future investments, rational decision makers base decisions on future consequences, not already-invested costs that are ""sunk"" and cannot be recovered. In Study 1, we restricted young adult college students' temporal horizons by instructing them to imagine that they did not have much longer to live; this manipulation decreased the sunk-cost fallacy. In Study 2, we replicated Study 1 and also found that the consequences of manipulating temporal horizons were most pronounced for prior investments of time and that prior investments of time and money had different implications for the sunk-cost fallacy, depending on the social or nonsocial decision domain. In Study 3, we manipulated temporal horizons by instructing students to imagine their time as a college student was coming to an end. Results were mostly similar to Study 2 but also suggested that focusing on one's mortality may have unique consequences. Implications of the three studies for understanding age differences in sunk-cost decisions, interventions to improve sunk-cost decisions, and the situations in which interventions might be most needed are discussed. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Heuristics and biases; Money; Social relationships; Sunk costs; Time",

Design/methodology/approach: The research was survey-based, involving 76 work teams and a total of 499 employees in 48 organisations. Findings: The analysis reveals a positive relationship between both bonding and bridging relationships and performance effectiveness and attitudinal outcomes. Team identity mediates the relationship between the team's social-network structure and its performance effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: The research investigates the performance effectiveness and attitudinal outcomes of social networks simultaneously, which is rare, but for study-design reasons fails to investigate behavioural outcomes. More extensive data would reveal more about the possible interaction between bridging and bonding. Practical implications: In order to improve performance effectiveness managerial attention should focus on building a team and social networks. Originality/value: The research shows that team identity fully mediates the influence of bonding and bridging social relationships. This finding sheds light on the processes that mediate performance effectiveness, which in turn facilitate understanding of how team dynamics lead to differing performance levels. The results also reveal how the type of social network affects the creation of a team identity: individuals identify with the team through the social networks to which they belong both within it and outside. Thus, team identity matters given the evidence suggesting that those who identify more with their work teams perform more effectively. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Group social capital; Identity; Networks; Performance; Quantitative; Work-team",

Despite their increasing popularity, in general, recommender systems suffer from data sparsity and cold-start problems. To alleviate these issues, in recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with the rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems. The main motivation for exploiting trust information in the recommendation process stems from the observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make are significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user communities, in addition to trust relations, distrust relations also exist between users. For instance, in Epinions, the concepts of personal ""web of trust"" and personal ""block list"" allow users to categorize their friends based on the quality of reviews into trusted and distrusted friends, respectively. Hence, it will be interesting to incorporate this new source of information in recommendation as well. In contrast to the incorporation of trust information in recommendation which is thriving, the potential of explicitly incorporating distrust relations is almost unexplored. In this article, we propose a matrix factorization-based model for recommendation in social rating networks that properly incorporates both trust and distrust relationships aiming to improve the quality of recommendations and mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start users issues. Through experiments on the Epinions dataset, we show that our new algorithm outperforms its standard trust-enhanced or distrustenhanced counterparts with respect to accuracy, thereby demonstrating the positive effect that incorporation of explicit distrust information can have on recommender systems. © 2014 ACM.","Matrix factorization; Recommender systems; Social relationships","Explicit trusts; Matrix factorizations; Side information; Social relationships; Recommender systems"

Drawing on Law's 'modes of ordering' and Latourian actor network theory, as well as on Beyes and Steyaert's recent contribution on 'performing space', the paper considers how flexworkers themselves reorganize space(s) as an ongoing accomplishment. The purpose and contribution is to offer an alternative to the view that the home and work are rigid containers fixed in social structure, to one that views them as self-referential space(s), reordered by flexworkers as they seek to 'keep the social moving'.

Social relationships of individuals on the Internet through social media have created added value for many industries. This phenomenon can be an opportunity for the health care industry, which has encountered huge challenges such as increasing demands, budget cuts, growing numbers of patients and more demanding patient expectations. Web 2.0 and social media have the potential value to make possible an increase in the productivity of modern health care and a reduction in cost to the central government. Social media introduces better channels of communication with patients to increase the value of e-health. Social media are building more social communities that empower patients to share their personalized health information and treatments. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on social support and transaction cost theories, this paper evaluates the current potential of social media to discuss values it can offer for the overall benefit of the health care industry. Findings: The results show how the social relationship of individuals provides online social support and reduction of cost through social media, leading to the development of modern health care. Implications and limitations are discussed at the end of the paper. Originality/value: The analysis results indicated that social media provides strong social support for patients who seek help online. Informational support and emotional support have been confirmed as two main dimensions of social support in online health care. It makes a contribution to the health care literature by extending it to online health care support in the context of social media. It may inform and provide some initial understanding to guide future research. In addition, this study indicates that social support theory and transaction cost are appropriate theoretical foundations for studies of online health care.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how gratitude helps to build, maintain and transform commercial relationships and to suggest noteworthy areas of investigation for those researchers seeking to help companies understand the role of gratitude in relationship marketing. Design/methodology/approach: Gratitude's role in relational exchange is explored by a review of relevant literature and two qualitative studies. Questions developed from the literature and exploratory interviews are then investigated in a main study through in-depth interviews with buyers and sellers of goods and services in both B2B and B2C contexts, leading to a grounded theoretical foundation. Generalizations and directions for future research are presented. Findings: Gratitude is a fundamental component of buyer-seller relationships and is critical for advancing relationship marketing theory and practice. Gratitude's changing role as relationship stages advance is described. Research limitations/implications: The research is of an exploratory nature. Confirmation of the generalizations by other studies is suggested. This research is largely consistent with that from a markets-as-networks perspective and moves relationship marketing research toward a more extended view. Practical implications: Gratitude should be included along with other relational mediators in discussions and investigations of relationship success, and practiced by those that seek to build, develop and enhance their buyer-seller relationships.

Finally, the paper verifies the model and examines the effects of the factors by empirical test through the data collected from questionnaires. The findings can give some guidance to managers and scholars.

This research investigated the influence of this money-is-all attitude on alienation based on a cross-cultural comparison of Korea, the US and Sweden. The money-is-all attitude was defined as a perspective in which money is regarded as an indicator of achievement or success. Self-administered online surveys were conducted with consumers ranging between the ages of 20 to 49 in Korea, the US and Sweden. The money-is-all attitude and alienation seemed to be more pervasive in Korea than in the US or Sweden. The money-is-all attitude was the factor with the strongest influence on alienation when controlling for socio-demographic factors. Furthermore, participation in sports activities was an important factor in decreasing alienation levels. The findings of this research imply that materialistic ways of thinking increase alienation and that money cannot contribute to human happiness and well-being. In addition, active participation in social activities can decrease alienation. The research results suggest that a materialistic, money-is-all attitude negatively influences alienation across cultures; in addition, in the US, an affluent consumption-based country, the money-is-all attitude had more explanatory power for alienation than in Sweden and Korea. A change in values to overcome the money-is-all attitude is required and the concepts of sufficiency and mindfulness are suggested as alternative life perspectives for the pursuit of well-being. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Alienation; Cross-cultural comparison; Korea; Money-is-all attitude; Sweden; US",

The functionality of this governance mechanism is suggested by agency theory. The embeddedness view counter-argues that social relationships matter for the effectiveness of corporate governance. In particular for ill-structured tasks like stock price valuation social networks solve fundamental coordination problems in markets by reducing the risks of market exchange, by establishing a common base of recognition and by getting actions and blocking actions. For the Swiss banking sector this article shows that the social embeddedness of corporate elites reduces the volatility of stock prices. With respect to regulatory pressure against multiple directorships it recommends a more balanced view. While for investors and stakeholders certain amounts of stock price volatility are surly desirable, exorbitant fluctuations of stock prices - like in financial crises - are definitely not. Social embeddedness should therefore be considered by economic and financial theory: it does prevent the misspecification of regulatory proposals and incentive regimes.","Banks; Corporate elites; Social embeddedness; Stock price volatility",

HLM analysis results indicated that awareness of expertise distribution positively influenced the decision to seek expertise at all levels of analysis examined. In addition, both positive and negative affective relationships influenced expertise seeking, although their pattern of influence differed across different levels of analysis. More specifically, having either a positive or a negative affective relationship with another group member affected the decision to seek expertise from that person. Although having many positive relationships had a positive effect on expertise seeking, having many negative affective relationships had no effect. Moreover, having both an awareness and a positive affective relationship with another group member amplified their positive effect on expertise seeking.

Such lies, therefore, could even be justified as an adaptive tool at times essential for the maintenance of social relationships. When speakers of English as a lingua franca (ELF) from different cultural backgrounds interact in order to build and maintain business relationships, the communication problems that develop can be accounted for in terms of differing perceptions that individuals have of what deceptive communication entails. This study aims to redefine intercultural business communication from an Asian perspective by examining naturally occurring business interaction between Japanese and Indian small business owners. The participants seek to establish a mutually beneficial relationship in order to cooperate in joint commercial activity. Special attention is paid to the lies told and detected by interlocutors. Employing the notion of business discourse, this study uses multiple analytical methods. The analysis depicts meaning jointly created as a result of strategic interaction.

These studies have examined the extent to which migrants build social relationships with their neighbours and the host society while also maintaining social links with their countries of origin, addressing the central role that leisure travel plays in sustaining increasingly dispersed social networks and maintaining the social capital of these networks and of the individuals involved in them. Using a case study approach to examine British retirement migration to Spain, we explore the relevance of transnational social networks in the context of international retirement migration, particularly the intensity of bidirectional visiting friends and relatives (VFR) tourism flows and the migrants' social contacts with friends and/or family back in their home country. Building on the concept of social capital and Putnam's distinction between bonding and bridging social capital, we propose a framework for the analysis of the migrants' international social networks. The results of a study conducted based on a sample of 365 British retirees living in the coast of Alicante (Spain) show both the strength of the retirees' international bonding social capital and the role of 'VFR's travel and communication technologies in sustaining the migrants' transnational social practices and, ultimately, their international bonding social capital. It also provides evidence for the reinforcing links between tourism-related mobility and amenity-seeking migration in later life. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","international retirement migration; social capital; Spain; tourism","immigrant population; international migration; mobility; retirement; social capital; social network; tourism; Spain"

It was possible to verify that the professional career contributes to the economic and emotional independency of the women interviewed, besides enabling new social relationships.

This study contributes to theory and practice by applying social impact theory to explain the social nature of group failures. Findings from two studies show that group size and relational distance substantially affect consumers' response to group service recovery strategies. Specifically, private economic recovery creates less consumer satisfaction as group size increases, whereas consumers with a distant social relationship are more satisfied with public recovery for both economic recovery and social recovery. However, consumers with close relationships are more satisfied with public economic recovery and private social recovery. Apart from offering practical insights, this study expands the theoretical understanding of service failures, suggesting that they occur in a complex social ecology instead of relatively simple dyadic interactions between service providers and consumers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Service failure; Service recovery; Social distance; Social impact theory",

Across two different studies (one organizational and one comprising MBA teams), we examined whether the friendship networks around women tend to be systematically misperceived and whether there were effects of these misperceptions on the women themselves and their teammates. Thus, we investigated the possibility (hitherto neglected in the network literature) that biases in friendship networks are triggered not just by the complexity of social relationships but also by the gender of those being perceived. Study 1 showed that, after controlling for actual network positions, men, relative to women, were perceived to occupy agentic brokerage roles in the friendship network-those roles involving less constraint and higher betweenness and outdegree centrality. Study 2 showed that if a team member misperceived a woman to occupy such roles, the woman was seen as competent but not warm. Furthermore, to the extent that gender stereotypes were endorsed by many individuals in the team, women performed worse on their individual tasks. But teams in which members fell back on well-rehearsed perceptions of gender roles (men rather than women misperceived as brokers) performed better than teams in which members tended toward misperceiving women occupying agentic brokerage roles.

Things become meaningful through our interactions with them, but how do people go about making meaning? What can we learn from an ethnography about the production of identity, creation of kinship, and use of diamonds in understanding selves and social relationships? By what means do people positioned within a globalized political–economy and a compelling universe of advertising interact locally with these tiny polished rocks? This book draws on 12 months of fieldwork with diamond consumers in New York City as well as an analysis of the iconic De Beers campaign that promised romance, status, and glamour to anyone who bought a diamond to show that this thematic pool is just one resource among many that diamond owners draw upon to engage with their own stones.

Social capital is a concept that has received particular attention within the social sciences. Despite this, scholars have relatively neglected whether and how tourism contributes to enhance levels of social capital. This is particularly true if non-Western societies, such as Malaysia, are referred to. Malaysia is a plural society that consists of three main ethnic groups, namely Malays, Chinese, and Indians. Considering the country's diverse socio-cultural fabric, social capital is a highly debated topic in Malaysia. Yet, there exists a paucity of data on how specific social practices, such as tourism, strengthen social relationships within Malaysian society. In an attempt to fill this gap, in-depth interviews were conducted with 22 Malaysians from the three main ethnic groups. The findings reveal that tourism is an experience that creates and strengthens social relationships among people irrespective of ethnic background. Overall, this article's contribution to our knowledge is twofold.

Medical criteria and activity are the main types of indicators people base their assessments on. The use of medical criteria (doctor's opinion, illnesses, risk factors, medicines, operations) stems more from interaction with the medical profession, which is differentiated by social class, than from a direct impact of the medicalization of old age. Furthermore, the meaning of medical criteria sometimes goes beyond health and relates to the social value of individuals, as in the case of operations. Perceived health is clearly unaffected by medical institutions when health is seen in terms of activity - mainly work, mobility and physical leisure activities. The social class conditions and social relationships in which household chores are performed or delegated are determinant. When household chores are performed for lack of help, they have a negative impact on perceived health, frequent among working-class women. Delegating household chores can also be stigmatising when the husband ""helps"" his wife with chores assigned to her. These observations form the basis for a new hypothesis about the paradox of women's greater longevity but poorer health. © La Doc. française.",,

Efficacious assignment of reviewers is one of the most critical processes that controls the quality of the entire project selection and also has a serious implication on business profit. Current methods that focus on workflow automation are more efficient than manual assignment; however, they are not effective, as they fail to consider the real insight of core tasks. Other decision models that analyze core tasks are effective but inefficient when handling large amounts of submissions, and they suffer from irrelevant assignment. Furthermore, they largely ignore real deep insight of back-end data such as quality of the reviewers (e.g., quality and citation impact of their produced research) and the effect of social relationships in project selection processes that are essential for identifying reviewers for interdisciplinary proposal evaluation. In light of these deficiencies, this research proposes a novel hybrid process analytics approach to decompose the complex reviewer assignment process into manageable subprocesses and applies data-driven decision models cum process analytics systematically from a triangular perspective via the research analytics framework to achieve high operational efficiencies and high-quality assignment. It also analyzes big data from scientific databases and generates visualized decision-ready information to support effective decision making. The proposed approach has been implemented to aid the project selection process of the largest funding agency in China and has been tested. The test results show that the proposed approach has the potential to add great benefits, including cost saving, improved effectiveness, and increased business value. © 2014 ACM.","Big data; Process analytics; Research analytics; Reviewer assignment","Process analytics; Project selection; Reviewer assignment; Big data"

Design/methodology/approach - Using a self-administered questionnaire, the data (n = 167) are collected from two Iranian Internet social networking sites, namely, facenama.com and cloob.com. Using LISREL 8.5, hypothesized relationships are examined through structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Findings - According to the results of the study, despite all assumptions and studies to the contrary, eWOM behaviors in VSNs are derived from neither users' flow experience nor their trust in VSNs, but they are mostly caused by VSNs' attributes, from which four are investigated in this study, namely, communication and social relationships, entertainment, information disclosure and ease of use. Nevertheless, according to the results, VSN attributes also influence trust and flow experience, trust in a VSN environment influences users' flow experience and eWOM in VSNs has significant impact on users' purchase intentions. The findings also revealed that the level of education of a user affects how much he trusts the VSN environment. Practical implications - The author examined flow experience, trust, eWOM behavior, purchase intentions and the VSNs' attributes to verify their relationships, providing a better understanding of an effective indirect marketing in VSNs. The results also have important implications for researchers. Originality/value - While flow experience, trust, word-of-mouth (WOM) behaviors and purchase intentions have been separately studied in Web sites, e-shopping malls and blogs, little research has sought to identify the existence of these elements within VSNs, their correlations with one another and how they are affected by VSNs' attributes. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behavior; Consumer generated advertising; Social networking sites; Viral marketing; Virtual communities; Word-of-mouth marketing",

Design/methodology/approach – Empirical data were collected via Facebook using the method of empathy-based stories (MEBS). The theoretical framework is grounded in the literature on motivation. Findings – The full-time working Millennials wrote more about intrinsic motivators than extrinsic ones. Additionally, there were several dichotomies of positive and negative factors causing motivation/ demotivation. Thus, the results contradict to some extent with the ones of Herzberg’s. The stories revealed that the most important things having an effect on motivation were an interesting, varying and flexible job and good relationships with colleagues and supervisor. Practical implications – The results revealed some particular factors that should be considered when designing HRM practices to dovetail with the motivational drivers of the Millennials: flexibility, work-life balance, convenient social relationships, need for coaching-based leadership and the opportunity to develop. Social implications – Due to retirements and shrinking generations, the impact of Generation Y is increasing in the workforce. Thus, recognising its motivational factors is important. Originality/value – The originality of the study partly rests in its methodological innovativeness. Often adopted by sociologists, this study introduces the method of MEBS to the business field. Furthermore, Facebook is still seldom used in data gathering.

The links among internationalization, reverse knowledge transfer and social capital and organizational innovation are analyzed.Design/methodology/approach – Structural equation modeling was used to check the research hypotheses with a sample of 104 multinational companies.Findings – The results show that internalization has no direct effect on organizational innovation but a indirect effect trhrough the transfer of knowledge from external subsidiaries to the headquarter. Furthermore, this knowledge and other that comes from internal and external social capital is essential for the development of innovations.Research limitations/implications – Self-reporting by the CEOs may be the most significant limitation, as a single key informant provided the data; multiple informants would enhance the validity of the research findings. A second limitation is the cross-sectional design of the research that does not allow observation of the short- and long-term impact of the relationships among the variables.Practical implications – Organizational innovation is not an easy task. However, those multinational companies which foster knowledge management practices that generate new knowledge from external subsidiaries, internal or external social relationships, will facilitate the generation of innovations. In consequence, these companies should foster the generation of knowledge from different sources.Originality/value – The focus of the study in this paper is on multinational companies and the possibility to acquire knowledge from different sources (inside organization, external local environment and international context).

The paper focuses on the impact of such changes on teachers, as professional workers within public schools and individual participants of change. The paper refers to psychosocial training as a coping strategy, analysing how school teachers deal with work-related stress, and what impact a training intervention might have on some individual dimensions. Subsequently, in the longitudinal study presented, we analysed whether the training intervention conducted was effective in terms of learning and change. The case under consideration is a primary school located in the South of Italy, and the participants in the training and research were 92 female teachers. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the designed and applied training programme, we measured how some important psychological dimensions have changed over time: self-efficacy, job satisfaction and interpersonal strain. According to a sociological learning approach, the results suggest the effectiveness of training programmes as enablers of change and solutions to some change paradoxes; when they respond to the identified needs, they are based on practical activities that require a collective participation, they focus on social relationships and processes and the knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. In the school context, the psychosocial training might represent a solution, if not a prevention strategy, for change management. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Job Satisfaction; School; Self-Efficacy; Training; Work-Related Stress",

The capacity to sustain value creation over time, and across turbulent environments, increasingly differentiates enterprise performance. Under the umbrella term of “dynamic capabilities”, a range of practices have been identified in the literature as contributing to an enterprise’s ability to learn to perform this task successfully.Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on case studies of three enterprises whose founders have sustained the creation of new value for customers over decades. Through a series of unstructured interviews with each founder, the tacit knowledge gained from years of learning how to create, and re-create, value, is made explicit through hermeneutic analysis of the interview transcripts.Findings: The data identify four key areas of leadership practice that underpin the capacity to learn to continuously create new value over significant periods of time. The most important of these are the social practices that generate and leverage the intangible capital resources (in particular, the resource of trust) that underpin the collaborative learning on which value creation processes depend.Research limitations/implications: As interpretive research, the knowledge accessed through this research is context-dependent and cannot be readily generalised. The validity of the knowledge is high, however, as the epistemological and ontological assumptions of the interpretive research paradigm recognise the political nature of organisations and, thus, of learning and value creation. As such, the knowledge generated by the case analyses offers a rich alternative perspective on the issue under research.Practical implications: The cases illuminate the nature of learning that supports continuous value creation in enterprises. Such learning is framed by several leadership practices that enable the self-reflexivity that underpins the continuous conversion of action-generated tacit knowledge into more strategically useful explicit knowledge. At the core of these leadership practices is stakeholder collaboration and intellectual humility.Social implications: The results show that learning to create sustainable value over time and diverse contexts, has a socio-political dimension in that it depends heavily on generating and leveraging the intangible resources (such as trust, commitment, ideas) that reside within social relationships.Originality/value: The research is located within the interpretive research paradigm and thus offers an alternative view to that of conventional positivist research. Furthermore, the results indicate that learning is a strategic priority in rapidly changing environments and, thus, is a key leadership responsibility. Furthermore, the results show that value creation is a collaborative stakeholder achievement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Knowledge creation; Leadership practices; Learning practices; Value creation",

One of the ways in which the subordination of sales assistants is manifested is when customers treat them badly, for instance in the form of verbal and physical abuse. We suggest that these power relations are not one-sided, but consist of both of the normative subordination that has been described in much of the previous research and of organisational superordination over customers. We also suggest that in many instances, difficult customer behaviour is triggered by this inherent contradiction in the role of sales assistants. When sales assistants perform superordinate actions, customers can respond by attempting to undermine the sales assistants' superordination and restore normative subordination.

Although the majority of social research has focused on mammals, especially primates, comparative research on lower vertebrates, such as reptiles, may also provide fascinating insight into functional mechanisms, environmental influences, and evolutionary processes shaping social behavior. Social behaviors often reflect rather complex mechanisms. Through a variety of interactions individuals establish social relationships (dominant/subordinate, friend/foe, potential mate/mating partner, kin/non-kin). In some cases this may require aggressive physical altercations and more passive interactions such as ritualistic competitions, behavioral sequences, behavioral postures, and other forms of signaling. Social interactions are dependent on context and environmental influences (e.g., time of day, time of year, habitat properties, temperature, predation risk). For example, the expression of territoriality is often limited to the breeding season or to highly valuable real estate where the benefits of aggressively restricting access to resources outweigh the energetic costs and risk of injury that accompany agonistic interactions. Finally, mediating environmental and experience dependent social behavior as well as maintaining and updating knowledge of relationship status requires sensory integration, recognition, memory, and other cognitive mechanisms. This chapter reviews social behavior and environmental influences across reptilian taxa with an emphasis on conspecific attraction and avoidance. This chapter highlights the complexity of social interactions observed in lower vertebrates, yields insight into the functional significance of social behaviors, and provides a foundation for discussion of evolutionary implications. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In response to criticisms leveled at rule-based ethics teaching by alternative approaches, we identify moral identity theory and experiments in moral psychology as useful sources to draw on for the creation of a new, identity-based ethics teaching approach. We develop and apply a set of regular self-reflection focused writing tasks added to the traditional teaching program over a one-semester period, and assess the outcomes of an overall sample of 149 postgraduate business school students, who were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: exposure to both identity-based tasks and rule-based teaching, exposure to rule-based teaching only, and the control condition (i.e., no exposure to ethics teaching). Our findings show that, while the three groups reported the same level of ethical decision making at the beginning of the semester, at the end of the semester the students who were exposed to both identity-based and rule-based teaching reported higher level of ethical decision making compared to those who were only exposed to rule-based education. In addition, the students who received rule-based teaching reported higher ethical decision making compared to those in the control condition. These results suggest that a teaching approach which appeals to the learner's moral identity can act as an effective leverage point when complementing rule-based teaching.

Many policies and strategies for sustainable everyday life have been initiated by governments and businesses, mainly based on technological innovations for reducing environmental impacts of production processes, designing better products, and providing infrastructure for collective services. There is, however, a growing recognition that sustainable lifestyles can be shaped not only through technological innovation, but also through social innovation. Social innovation is an emergent field of academic research and everyday practice that aims to meet social needs more effectively than existing solutions by engaging the power of social actors, stimulating interactions among them and enabling dynamic social processes.

Federal Election Commission (2010), the US Supreme Court sharply curtailed the ability of the state to limit political speech by for-profit corporations. This new legal situation elevates the question of corporate political involvement: in what manner and to what extent is it ethical for for-profit corporations to participate in the political process in a liberal democratic society? Using Scanlon's version of contractualism, I argue for a number of substantive and procedural constraints on the political activities of businesses. Central to this contractualist analysis is (1) an identification of the self-governance-based interests of individuals that are affected by corporate political activity and (2) a method for judging the various assignments of social rights, duties and roles according to how they collectively meet those interests. Together, these two features make this contractualist approach distinctive and allow it to generate substantive ethical results. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Contractualism; Policy",

In this context and in view of a strategic and profound embedding of the CSR-concept, this study proposes a conceptual CSR framework, mainly on the basis of the recently published umbrella guideline ISO 26000. The proposed model for practice goes beyond the limitations of traditional PDCA cycles, through applying interconnected soft and hard factors as building blocks within a circular framework, thereby aiming to reduce the gap between the execution of loose sustainable initiatives and the application of a sustainability balanced scorecard. The framework has been named 'Sus5', as it connects five inherent features of sustainable business (management knowledge & commitment, stakeholder knowledge & commitment, strategic planning, knowledge & commitment on the work floor, and operational execution & monitoring). The added empirical study, which has been executed within the Flemish business landscape, reflects on the average Flemish as-is attention for each independent proposed building block, thereby aiming to retrieve in which extent the attention areas of the average company are aligned with the ones of Sus5 as the basis for drawing conclusions on the general feasibility level of applying Sus5. Through its intuitive and pragmatic character, Sus5 might in this context firstly serve as a practical tool for organizations to undertake a self-assessment and detect possible gaps in their CSR-policy, secondly to motivate them to shift the emphasis to a broader set of attention areas, based on the realization that a thorough CSR policy consists of a set of interdependent building blocks, being bonded by causal relations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Business, ethics, and society in critical management studies"". It summarizes ideas presented by a variety of scholars who were actively grappling with questions and challenges of contemporary management education, specifically with its role in bringing about social change while introducing Madeline Toubiana's article, ""Business pedagogy for social justice?"" by way of example. Extending from the insights emerging from in this article, we briefly discuss the importance of reflecting on the values of social justice that we hold as business school academics, in order to begin to imagine the possibilities of the classroom as an arena in which we can inspire social change. We argue that academics ought to be reflexive about the values of social justice that they espouse, and that they ought to vigorously and substantively integrate these values into management education, such as through their infusion into curricula. Returning to Paulo Friere's (1970) idea of ""conscientization,"" we propose that business school academics should use the classroom as a forum in which to develop what Friere calls ""critical understanding."" In sum, these two points present discursive sources of agency to move toward redressing the systems of institutional constraints, which are currently thwarting business school academics engagement with social justice as identified in Toubiana's article. © The Author(s) 2013.","critical management; Management education; pedagogy; social justice; values",

Reading the rogue trader through institutional logics and Jacques Derrida's book Rogues, we suggest that the rogue is not on the dark side of organization so much as in an indeterminate grey zone, where the boundary between acceptable behaviour and misconduct is unclear. We further argue that this boundary is necessarily unclear as it is in the nature of organization, at least within capitalist trading systems, to push the boundaries of what is possible and acceptable. The rogue thus helps produce the boundaries of ethically acceptable organizational behaviour in the very act of transgressing them. The location-bound specificity of the rogue, as well as the symbolic process of naming an individual or a state a rogue, finds a relevant correlate in the villain, as Derrida suggests. But what we call 'rogue organization' may be constitutive of organization per se. As such, there is a potential roguishness in organization that should be addressed when considering the dark side of ethics in organization studies. © The Author(s) 2014.","business ethics; Derrida; institutional logics; organizational misbehaviour; rogue traders",

However, scientific knowledge about the role that morality, ethics, and values play in this issue is still scarce. Starting from this research gap, we focus on corporations as central decision makers in modern society and analyze how they respond to societal demands to take responsibility for climate change. While relevant literature on business ethics and climate change either places a high premium on morality or presents a strong skeptical bias, our sociological model depicts morality as an indeterminate force: it can lead to both workable solutions or merely reinforce the status quo, depending on what different corporations make of it. We describe, on the one side, the diffusion of moral values in the media discourse on climate change and, on the other side, the specific responses of corporations. While the media discourse generates a pressure on corporations to act responsibly, their moral claims do not provide clear advice for action. As a result, morality becomes available to organizations as a medium that can be re-specified according to their internal dynamics. Corporations transform moral values into something compatible with their own structures through a variety of different responses: introducing formal ethical structures (e.g., codes of conduct), initiating value-oriented projects, or developing informal moral norms, and so on. In some occurrences, morality becomes a mere façade, while in others it serves as a decision-making criterion and deeply influences core activities in firms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Decision making; Mass media; Morality; Organizations",

Broadly speaking, MOOCs are an extension of current long-distance learning courses, and pave the way for new business models that include elements of open education, separating the concepts of teaching and assessment. Key considerations for the deployment of a MOOC at an educational institution are the course's value proposition, the implementation of an adequate technological platform, the choice of a teaching model to ensure learning, care in maintaining the quality of the course material, recognition of learning acquired by students, and a sustainable business model. The proliferation of courses run by prestigious institutions offering high-quality open learning material is giving rise to the universalisation of knowledge; a scenario in which institutions with lesser repute will increasingly encounter difficulties to compete. Granting students a pivotal role in the education process, and welcoming their influence on the design and orientation of course contents as well as the way educators adapt learning approaches, may represent a valid strategy in the quest for differentiation in a highly competitive environment. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

In the first experiment, participants judged the acceptability of remuneration policies and in the second that of executive bonuses. In each study, participants judged a set of 36 situations. To create the scenarios, we varied (a) retributive justice-the amount of remuneration; (b) procedural justice-the clarity of the procedure that determined the remuneration; (c) distributive justice-the extent of the distribution of bonus payments amongst employees; and (d) restorative justice-a special compensation for hazardous working conditions or accidents at work. K-means clustering of all 36 judgments revealed four different personal positions in both experiments. One group of people readily accepted all situations. The other three groups' judgments were mainly a function of distributive justice modulated in different ways by the context determined by the other variables. Furthermore, people conceive of distributive justice as categorical: Acceptability judgments only increase if companies give bonuses to all employees.

This paper proposes an educational strategy to overcome the philosophical confusions about relativism in which business people and students are often trapped. First, the paper provides some conceptual distinctions and clarifications related to moral relativism, particularism, and virtue ethics. More particularly, it revisits arguments demonstrating that virtues in business are not in contradiction with the relevance of universal principles, despite the fact that virtue ethics is often identified with particular relationships and contexts. It goes on to show how students and managers, but also researchers, often mix up radically different conceptions of moral relativism. It is also argued that this confusion is in part created by the cross-cultural management literature in which the methodological stance of the value-freedom of the social sciences is, in a perplexingly mistaken way, transformed into a rejection of all normative discussion and a plea for relativism. The remainder of the paper presents some tools that may be helpful in steering people toward less simplistic views about moral relativism and virtue ethics. It further argues that it is equally important to spell out that moral universalism can be understood in a humble way, without implying either arrogant ethnocentrism or omniscience, as part of an ongoing debate that progresses gradually. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cross-cultural management; Moral relativism; Universalism; Virtues",

While important, they are insufficient in themselves to deliver the holistic changes necessary to achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. How can we encourage corporate innovation that significantly changes the way companies operate to ensure greater sustainability? Sustainable business models (SBM) incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests, including environment and society. They are important in driving and implementing corporate innovation for sustainability, can help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes, and serve as a key driver of competitive advantage. Many innovative approaches may contribute to delivering sustainability through business models, but have not been collated under a unifying theme of business model innovation. The literature and business practice review has identified a wide range of examples of mechanisms and solutions that can contribute to business model innovation for sustainability. The examples were collated and analysed to identify defining patterns and attributes that might facilitate categorisation. Sustainable business model archetypes are introduced to describe groupings of mechanisms and solutions that may contribute to building up the business model for sustainability. The aim of these archetypes is to develop a common language that can be used to accelerate the development of sustainable business models in research and practice.

The essay aims to articulate an account of meaningful work in the Catholic social teachings (CST). CST rejects the subjectivist and relativist notion of work which affirms the absolute freedom of individuals to choose their commitment and goals, even if this includes experiencing satisfaction in dehumanizing work. First, the paper will present a summary account of some of the current views on meaningful work from the objective-normative approach. This will be followed by a systematic treatment of the meaning and value of work in the CST, the similarities and differences it has with alternative views, and its implications for the way we promote meaningful work. The paper will argue that by recognizing the subjective and objective dimensions of work and affirming that although the two are inseparable, the former takes priority over the latter; CST develops a holistic, comprehensive, and coherent account of meaningful work which overcomes some of the difficulties that are usually encountered in dealing with this issue from a purely objective approach. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Catholic social teachings; Meaningful work; Work ethics",

Central to this dilemma is the internal/external disclosure dichotomy; disclosure of organisational wrongdoing to an external recipient is seen as disloyal, whilst disclosure to an internal recipient is seen as loyal. Understanding how the organisation and society have dealt with these problems over the last 30 years is undertaken through an analysis of Vandekerckhove's (Whistleblowing and organisational social responsibility, 2006) project, which seeks to place the normative legitimisations of whistleblowing legislation and organisational whistleblowing policies within a globalisation semantic able to contain this conflict between society and the organisation. This project fails, it is argued, because of Vandekerckhove's particular understanding of the organisation as an autopoietic system, i.e. an operationally closed system. A case is made to understand organisations as complex systems, i.e. operationally open systems. Critical Complexity theory sees the identities of systems and components as coterminous. In the context of the organisation, this means that the identities of the corporation and its corporate members arise and die together. The whistleblower's disclosure reconfigures the organisation by forcing the organisation to open up and make its boundaries flexible, making the designation 'internal' or 'external' to the organisation, and, therefore, who qualifies as a recipient of a disclosure of wrongdoing, flexible. The organisation is restrained from retailing against the whistleblower, because its identities are coterminous. Furthermore, as the disclosure cannot be categorically defined as either internal or external, the question of whether an external disclosure can qualify as an act of organisational loyalty becomes moot. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Autopoietic systems; Corporate responsibility; Critical Complexity; Internal/external disclosure; Organisational loyalty; Relational responsiveness; Whistleblowing",

This assessment is based on an analysis of structured, in-depth interviews with CSR managers from sixteen industry-leading, Danish companies. The managers' descriptions of their interactions with stakeholders reveal that their practices fall short of the normative, theoretical ideals since their focus is primarily on just listening to others in the strategy-making process rather than directly involving others in decision-making. Also, because non-stakeholders, such as paid-for consultants, are found to be note-worthy influencers in the CSR strategy-making process, it is concluded that the process is not only a stakeholder management exercise, but an expert, institutionalized, strategic issues management exercise as well. © 2013.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR strategy; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder management; Strategic issues management",

Findings based on a sample of 275 large publicly listed U.S. firms reveal that family firms outperform non-family firms during recessions. This superior performance is partially driven by family firms' proactive marketing behavior and their relatively strong emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR). During recessions, while non-family firms tend to decrease their advertising intensities and rates of new product introduction (NPI), family firms are likely to maintain relatively high levels of advertising intensity and rates of NPI. Unlike non-family firms, family firms are also likely to maintain high levels of corporate social performance (CSP) during recessions. These results underscore the benefits of proactive marketing behavior and a continued emphasis on CSR during economic downturns. The authors also add to the scant family-firm literature, demonstrating the family firm to be an effective organizational form. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Advertising intensity; Corporate social responsibility; Family firms; Innovation; Recession",

The argument in this article is that the impact of evaluation is mediated by program stakeholders' engagement in evaluation activities. This mediation provides a foundation for a consideration of the merit of ECB. This study sought to find confirmation that stakeholder engagement in evaluation could influence the outcomes of a program and thus subsequently provide evidence as to the merit and significance of evaluation engagement. Multiple forms of evaluation data were collected for two long-term public health evaluations and coded and collated again on an evidence-based rubric in close consultation with the community. The influence of stakeholder's willingness and capacity to engage in evaluation activity was also investigated. The analysis revealed that stakeholders' engagement in evaluations provided reasonably unique contributions to the overall program outcomes. This article provides the impetus for evaluation-based capacity building, in that it presents empirical evidence that willingness, capacity to engage in evaluation activities, and the use of evaluation information increases the probability of achieving desired outcomes and sustainability. © The Author(s) 2013.","evaluation capacity building; evaluation impact; evaluation use; stakeholder engagement",

However, ethical theories and perspectives from these different systems are rarely discussed in relation to each other, even though in practice these systems constantly interact. This paper explores ethical theories and perspectives that may apply to the WDP-RTW field, and discusses these in relation to perspectives attributed to dominant stakeholders in this field, and to potential differences in different jurisdictional contexts. Literature was sought primarily in biomedical ethics, business ethics, and public administration ethics. In biomedical ethics, four ethical principles are dominant: autonomy, beneficence, nonmalevolence, and justice. Business ethics involve theories on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), social contracts, and organizational justice. Public administration ethics focus on constitutional theory, citizenship, social equity, virtue, and public interest. Several concepts were identified as relevant for ethical analyses in the WDP-RTW field, including justice; individual autonomy; nonmalevolence; economic and social responsibility; and social contracts. These concepts provide a vocabulary that may be used to analyze stakeholders' actions and interactions in RTW processes. It was also noted how the power balance between stakeholders will influence which ethical perspectives will influence RTW. Jurisdictional differences that influence RTW processes with regard to stakeholder responsibilities were identified, as well as varying beliefs as to who is the client in different compensation systems.

This line of research is important since firms continue to invest in CSR even though past studies reveal a limited linkage between financial value and CSR. However, the business case for CSR or ""doing good while making a profit,"" appears to be advancing within the business ethics literature as a preferred conception of CSR. We conjecture that the greater unification and refinement of both profit maximization and stakeholder interests through corporate acts, not statements alone, will sustain the financial value of CSR in a less regulated global business environment. We study the triangle of what companies say, what companies do, and firm financial performance. We analyze Fortune 250 firms and find a positive association between what companies do based on KLD Research and Analytics, Inc. (KLD) ratings, and what companies state about ethics in their CSR statements. We then employ regression analysis and find that companies' socially responsible acts are positively associated with overall firm value and financial performance. Yet we do not find a statistically significant association between what companies say regarding ethics in their CSR statements and their financial outcomes. These results suggest that firm value and financial performance is associated with what companies do and not what they say. Our results seem to be driven by multinational corporations (MNCs) and not by non-MNCs. This is possibly because MNCs generally operate in a less regulated global business environment that often necessitates strong ethical corporate leadership to further stakeholder interests. Overall, these results help reconcile corporate and stakeholder objectives since evidence of a link between financial performance and doing good sustains global CSR. © 2014 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Friedman's position, nevertheless, has retained currency among many business thinkers. In this article, we argue that Friedman's economic writings assume an economy in which businesses operate under the protections of limited liability, which allows corporations to privatize their gains while externalizing their losses. By accepting limited liability, Friedman must also accept a view of business as embedded in social interdependency, which serves as the logical and moral foundation for corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Workplace stress leads to psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects. Sufferers adopt different coping mechanisms in attempts to mitigate their condition. Using an online survey, opinions were sought from architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers in South Africa. The contribution of the research reported in this paper lies in its examination of the work stress experienced by construction professionals in a developing country characterized by economic hardship and social problems, such as inequality and crime. Most respondents experience high levels of stress at work. Architects (more than engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers) and female (more than male) professionals feel stressed. Psychological effects of workplace stress include the feeling of not being appreciated by others for a job well-done, feeling dissatisfied with one's own performance at work, and feeling tense at work. Physiological effects include disturbances to usual sleep patterns, difficulty in relaxing after hours, and difficulty in concentrating. Sociological effects include a strain on family life, social activities, and social relationships. A wide range of positive coping mechanisms (or countermeasures) is reported, including physical exercise in addition to intellectual and cultural activities. From a negative-coping perspective, consumption of alcohol is widespread, with more than one-third of respondents consuming 3-9 units/week.

We do this by investigating whether the extent of underpricing is significantly reduced by underwriter reputation. We find that the role of underwriter reputation as a mechanism of disciplining opportunistic behavior and as a third-party certification is muted. Although underwriter reputation is still highly correlated with offering price, underwriter reputation doesn't lower underpricing effectively. Underwriters simply take advantage of their reputation for their selfish interests, which unethically damages stock investment returns, especially for the small and middle shareholders.

In this paper, we draw from the literature to elaborate three caring orientations associated with craft practices: caring for materials, caring for process, and caring for end-users.

Drawing on stakeholder theory, we develop hypotheses about (a) market investor reaction to the disclosure of new, relevant corporate environmental performance in both the short and longer (6–12-month) term, (b) whether market investors’ reaction reflects industry context, and (c) whether firm-level contextual variables representing firm size, and market legitimacy significantly impacts the investor reaction. We find that, for the sample of the largest 500 US firms ranked by Newsweek, investors react positively both to the raw and within-industry rankings of green performance in terms of both short-term and longer-term (up to 12 months) returns. Moreover, the investor reaction is significantly influenced by contextual variables such as firm size and firm market legitimacy. Our results are compatible with the inference that rating agencies like Newsweek serve a valuable information dissemination function such that investors in better ranked firms anticipate larger future cash flows due to more positive reactions from key stakeholders such as environmentally-conscious customers, employees, NGOs, regulators, and thus reward these firms with stock price increases. Finally, larger, more visible firms benefit more, while firms which have more market legitimacy (represented by past financial performance) benefit less.

In order to begin addressing these issues, this paper compares what two virtue frameworks-one focused on virtue in the context of community and the other on individuals as virtuous agents-lead to when evaluating the actions of parties to the 2002-2004 UK Fire Service dispute. The analysis argues that the virtue frameworks proposed by MacIntyre and Slote offer different but complimentary evaluations. Both not only point to potential problems with industrial disputes, but also recognise the legitimacy of action that is based in good motivations and carried out with regard for the virtues. It seems that fire fighters and their immediate supervisors, on the whole, met the conditions of virtue, but that it is open to question if the leaders of the Fire Brigades Union and the Government did the same. The analysis goes on to suggest which modes of negotiation would be acceptable under the virtue frameworks, and the implications for those involved in industrial dispute. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Employee relations; Fire fighters; Industrial action; MacIntyre; Negotiation; Slote; Strike; Virtue ethics",

Traditional project valuation methods attempt to monetize the benefit and cost impacts of environmental and social impacts. Monetizing costs and benefits of environmental and social goods and services however is challenging. To avoid the need to assign a priori dominance to any of these capital forms, we derive a composite index formed as an aggregate of sub-indices that represent financial returns, environmental impacts and social effects, index weights are obtained through solving a series of data envelopment analysis optimization models from a set of sub-indices over each project’s life. We assess the reliability and robustness of this approach using a portfolio of corporate projects. The sustainability of each project is benchmarked against the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ performing project within the portfolio so that weights of the component indices are derived using only the portfolio data. This approach ranks projects according to the optimal trade-off between sustainable outcomes without the need to arbitrarily prescribe weights to ensure environmental or social outcomes are met. The design of the model naturally favors projects that adequately address the full spectrum of economic, environmental, social, and any other desirable factors relative to the portfolio of projects under assessment. The results provide reliable and robust guidance for sustainable business decisions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Composite index; Data envelopment analysis; Net present value; Optimization; Project finance; Sustainable development",

However, a conceptual framework for this work is still lacking. In The Moral Background, Gabriel Abend develops just such a framework and uses it to investigate the history of business ethics in the United States from the 1850s to the 1930s. According to Abend, morality consists of three levels: moral and immoral behavior, or the behavioral level; moral understandings and norms, or the normative level; and the moral background, which includes what moral concepts exist in a society, what moral methods can be used, what reasons can be given, and what objects can be morally evaluated at all. This background underlies the behavioral and normative levels; it supports, facilitates, and enables them. Through this perspective, Abend historically examines the work of numerous business ethicists and organizations-such as Protestant ministers, business associations, and business schools-and identifies two types of moral background. ""Standards of Practice"" is characterized by its scientific worldview, moral relativism, and emphasis on individuals' actions and decisions. The ""Christian Merchant"" type is characterized by its Christian worldview, moral objectivism, and conception of a person's life as a unity. The Moral Background offers both an original account of the history of business ethics and a novel framework for understanding and investigating morality in general. © 2014 by Princeton University Press.

Guided by institutional theory as a theoretical framework and social constructionism as a philosophical stance, this study uses a qualitative, interview-based methodology. Capitalizing on in-depth, face-to-face interviews with Muslim Arab women entrepreneurs across four countries in the Arab Middle East region, the results portray how Islamic work values and ethics are embedded in the entrepreneurial activities of these Arab women. The results also illustrate how Muslim women entrepreneurs seek well-being (falah) in their life and excellence (itqan) in their work while running their businesses. The Muslim women entrepreneurs adhered to the Islamic work-related values of good and hard work (amal salih), honesty and truthfulness (sidik and amanah), fairness and justice (haqq and adl), and benevolence (ihsaan) and perceived them as instrumental to the survival and success of their enterprises. The agency of the Muslim Arab women allowed them to construct and navigate their entrepreneurial careers away from the traditional, doctrinaire interpretations of Islam. This study, therefore, contributes to theory development on the interrelationship between gender and business ethics within entrepreneurial contexts and in relation to Muslim values. It also contributes to studies on entrepreneurship and business ethics by showing how Arab women practice entrepreneurship and project their faith in their enterprises. The implications of the study for academics, multinational corporations, and globalization are numerous and important for understanding how business is conducted in Islamic countries. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Arab Middle East; Business ethics; Hadeeth; Islam/Muslim; Qur’an; Women entrepreneurs",

For him, the conceptions of the local community and its normative framework, of the enterprise, and of the individuals within it need to be aligned with each other and developed together. Over time, four processes have, however, led to a widening gap between the business world and the local community. These are (1) the dissemination of the corporate model, (2) the transformation of the entrepreneurial role toward an agency role, (3) changes in the ownership structure, and (4) changes in the relation to the local community. This article presents Smith’s integrative conception of business and its contributions to the development of integrative theories of organizations and of business–society relations in the twenty-first century. Among others, it discusses the necessity to develop a normative-relational dimension of organizations that addresses the relations between the organization, its members (e.g., owners and managers), and the normative framework of the local community. This integrative approach of business–society relations challenges current business ethics research which often suggests that solutions to the current scandals lie either within the framework, the organization, or the individuals. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","(Dis-)embeddedness; Adam Smith; Business and society; Self-interest; Social enterprise",

I examine Google’s decision to enter the Chinese search engine market as an example of such a conflict. I consider the view that Google’s managers engaged in justifiable moral compromise in making the choice to engage in self-censorship and show how this view depends on the idea of genuine moral dilemmas or irresolvable moral conflicts. I argue that there are serious reasons to doubt the existence of genuine moral dilemmas both in the abstract, as well as in the context of managerial responsibility. I propose an alternative account for what Google’s managers ought to do, as well as others who face relevantly similar situations. The account contains two conditions for permissibly contributing to another party’s failure to live up to their moral responsibilities. The first condition is that the manager must intend and act in such a way as to minimize the firm’s complicity in the other entity or actor’s failure, which in most cases will imply a duty for the manager to take actions that aim towards changing the institutional context. Under the second condition, managers ought to communicate to the firm’s constituents that they take seriously the importance of the interests at stake. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate responsibility; Dirty hands; Human rights; Intentionality; Managerial responsibility; Moral conflict; Moral dilemmas",

We propose that job seekers receive signals from CSP that inform three signal-based mechanisms that ultimately affect organizational attractiveness: job seekers' anticipated pride from being affiliated with the organization, their perceived value fit with the organization, and their expectations about how the organization treats its employees. We hypothesized that these signal-based mechanisms mediate the relationships between CSP and organizational attractiveness, focusing on two aspects of CSP: an organization's community involvement and pro-environmental practices. In an experiment (n 180), we manipulated CSP via a company's web pages. In a field study (n 171), we measured CSP content in the recruitment materials used by organizations at a job fair and job seekers' perceptions of the organizations' CSP.

A properly designed assessment procedure supported by an information system outlines the situation of the organisation and can help it to be improved. The authors propose a conceptual framework for performance assessment. To win a business excellence award, great amounts of effort, money, time, and personnel are required.

A clear vision, an appropriate culture and willingness to change can facilitate the implementation of such a framework. Nowadays, crises affect many organisations around the world. In such a situation, change is a crucial factor for survival and success.

This review summarizes and integrates the results of studies focusing on NPOs' governance effectiveness. It proposes an extension of stakeholder theory to NPOs concerning governance involving diverse stakeholder groups. What makes this paper innovative is that it aims to identify more than effective board governance, and takes the perspectives of multiple nonprofit key stakeholders into account. This approach is particularly valuable as numerous researchers argue that the likelihood of NPOs being perceived as effective increases when they manage to align the, possibly very diverse, expectations of stakeholders on good governance. We consequently focus on the relationship between (1) the needs and objectives of key stakeholders and (2) (expected) governance (structures) in NPOs. The stakeholders we consider are government, beneficiaries, private donors, board members, management, volunteers, and non-managerial staff members. Results not only show the lack of attention some stakeholders have received in the literature, but also the governance related conflicting needs and objectives between stakeholder groups. In addition, even in the same stakeholder groups it is not rare that opposing findings are reported. Several studies indicate the (unforeseen) negative impact on (being accountability to) other stakeholders when NPOs try to be responsive to the needs and objectives of a particular stakeholder group. The value of this review lies in the fact that it reveals both the complexity of and the need for stakeholder management in NPOs, if they want to be perceived as (more) effective by their numerous stakeholders, and related to that gain insight in how to improve their governance practices. Numerous directions for further research are suggested. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Effectiveness; Nonprofit organizations; Perceptions; Stakeholder approach",

These MSS cover a wide array of different disciplines, aims and activities of organisations. Also, organisations are populated with an enormous diversity of independent management systems (MSs). An integrated management system (IMS) tends to integrate some or all components of the business. Maximising their integration in one coherent and efficient MS is increasingly a strategic priority and constitutes an opportunity for businesses to be more competitive and consequently, promote its sustainable success. Those organisations that are quicker and more efficient in their integration and continuous improvement will have a competitive advantage in obtaining sustainable value in our global and competitive business world. Several scholars have proposed various theoretical approaches regarding the integration of management sub-systems, leading to the conclusion that there is no common practice for all organisations as they encompass different characteristics. One other author shows that several tangible and intangible gains for organisations, as well as to their internal and external stakeholders, are achieved with the integration of the individual standardised MSs. The purpose of this work was to conceive a model, Flexible, Integrator and Lean for IMSs, according to ISO 9001 for quality; ISO 14001 for environment and OHSAS 18001 for occupational health and safety (IMS-QES), that can be adapted and progressively assimilate other MSs, such as, SA 8000/ISO 26000 for social accountability, ISO 31000 for risk management and ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management, among others. The IMS-QES model was designed in the real environment of an industrial Portuguese small and medium enterprise, that over the years has been adopting, gradually, in whole or in part, individual MSSs. The developed model is based on a preliminary investigation conducted through a questionnaire. The strategy and research methods have taken into consideration the case study. Among the main findings of the survey we highlight: the creation of added value for the business through the elimination of several organisational wastes; the integrated management of the sustainability components; the elimination of conflicts between independent MS; dialogue with the main stakeholders and commitment to their ongoing satisfaction and increased contribution to the company's competitiveness; and greater valorisation and motivation of employees as a result of the expansion of their skill base, actions and responsibilities, with their consequent empowerment. A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) constitute the support, in a perspective of business excellence, to the follow up of the organisation's progress towards the vision and achievement of the defined objectives in the context of each component of the IMS model. The conceived model had many phases and the one presented in this work is the last required for the integration of quality, environment, safety and others individual standardised MSs. Globally, the investigation results, by themselves, justified and prioritised the conception of an IMS-QES model, to be implemented at the company where the investigation was conducted, but also a generic model of an IMS, which may be more flexible, integrator and lean as possible, potentiating the efficiency, added value both in the present and, fundamentally, for future. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","added value; continuous improvement; environmental management system (EMS); integrated management systems (IMS); occupational health and safety management system (OH&SMS); quality management system (QMS); sustainable business",

The implications for business ethics from the study of this movement is that the notion of corporate social responsibility needs to be adjusted in order to accommodate the hizmet approach but that there are limits to this adjustment due to gender and labor rights considerations. The paper sees itself as a contribution to an alternative approach for Islamic business ethics very much in need of further development and encourages further research along these lines. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Constructivism; Corporate social responsibility; Gender; Gülen; Hizmet; Islam; Religion; Turkey",

We develop this mutually enhancing approach in terms of normative ascriptions of responsibility, while leaving aside empirical implications in terms of mutual awareness of responsibility between individuals and corporations.

We seek to correct this imbalance by examining works of Al-Ghazali, an early Muslim philosopher, scholar, and mystic. His approach to Sufism, combining an interpretation of revelation with reason, can contribute to new developments in business ethics (BE) scholarship and practice especially in Muslim communities. His thought portrays a vibrant work ethic that, while based in Sufism, has important practical implications for business.

Board gender diversity has been the subject of several studies carried out by international organizations such as Catalyst (Increasing gender diversity on boards: Current index of formal approaches, 2012), the World Economic Forum (Hausmann et al., The global gender gap report, 2010), and the European Board Diversity Analysis (Is it getting easier to find women on European boards? 2010). They all lead to reports confirming the overall relatively low proportion of women on boards and the slow pace at which more women are being appointed.

Based on institutional theory, this study hypothesizes and tests whether this variation can be attributed to differences in cultural settings across countries. Our analysis of the representation of women on boards for 32 countries during 2010 reveals that two cultural characteristics are indeed associated with the observed differences. We use the cultural dimensions proposed by Hofstede (Culture’s consequences: International differences in work-related values, 1980) to measure this construct.

This paper uses a case study of Thailand's electricity sector to create realistic estimates for the relative contributions of local and global technological learning to reducing these cost in the future and discusses implications of such learnings for international climate policy. For six renewable electricity technologies, we derive estimates for the share of locally and globally sourced goods and services, and analyze the effects of local and global learning during the implementation of Thailand's renewable energy targets for 2021. Our results suggest that, in aggregate, the largest potential for cost reduction lies in local learning. This finding lends quantitative support to the argument that the conditions enabling local learning, such as a skilled workforce, a stable regulatory framework, and the establishment of sustainable business models, have a more significant impact on cost of renewable energy in developing countries than global technology learning curves. The recent shift of international support under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change towards country-specific technology support is therefore promising. However, our results also show that the relative importance of local and global learning differs significantly between technologies, and is determined by technology and country characteristics. This suggests that international support need to consider both the global perspective and local context and framework conditions in order to reap the full benefits of technological learning across the wide range of clean technologies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate policy; Renewable energy; Technological capabilities; Technological learning; Technology transfer; Thailand",

We commonly expect, on one side, that profitable corporations have stronger incentives to reveal information on the social performance in order to improve their publicity; on the other hand, companies may face the fear of rising costs due to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. With increasing concerns of CSR, it is timely to investigate the relationship between the disclosure of corporate social performance and the financial performance. In this paper with the above study objective, we use Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reports of 75 sample companies, collect evidences by applying the method of structured content analysis of the cases and attempt to identify this relationship. The corporate social performance is measured by the indicators according to the GRI guidelines, i.e. within the categories of Labor practices and decent work, Human Rights, Society as well as Product responsibility. Financial performance is measured by return on equity, sales growth and cash flow/sales ratio. Using statistical evaluation methods, our results indicate that the categories of Human Rights, Society as well as Product responsibility display a significant and positive correlation with the return on equity. Same conclusion also holds for many CSR indicators. Nevertheless, when examining the CSR practices across different manufacturing sectors, we have not observed significant differences.

Retailers are important because they are at the interface between manufacturers of products and consumers and they supply the vast majority of consumer goods in developed countries like the UK, including energy using products. Large retailers have a consistent history of corporate responsibility reporting and have included plans and actions to influence consumer emissions within them.This paper adapts two frameworks to use them for systematically assessing large retailers' initiatives aimed at reducing consumers' emissions. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) is adapted and used to analyse the strategic scope and coherence of these initiatives in relation to the businesses' sustainability strategies. The ISM 'Individual Social Material' framework is adapted and used to analyse how consumer behaviour change mechanisms are framed by retailers. These frameworks are used to analyse eighteen initiatives designed to reduce consumer emissions from eight of the largest UK retail businesses, identified from publicly available data.The results of the eighteen initiatives analysed show that the vast majority were not well planned nor were they strategically coherent. Secondly, most of these specific initiatives relied solely on providing information to consumers and thus deployed a rather narrow range of consumer behaviour change mechanisms. The research concludes that leaders of retail businesses and policy makers could use the FSSD to ensure processes, actions and measurements are comprehensive and integrated, in order to increase the materiality and impact of their initiatives to reduce consumer emissions in use. Furthermore, retailers could benefit from exploring different models of behaviour change from the ISM framework in order to access a wider set of tools for transformative system change. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Framework for strategic sustainable development; Influencing behaviours; Retailers; Sustainability; Sustainable consumption","Climate change; Consumer behavior; Decision making; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Planning; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Corporate responsibility; Household energy consumption; Influencing behaviours; Non-governmental organisations; Retailers; Sustainability strategies; Sustainable consumption; Sales"

An empirical investigation indicates that the various environmental orientation fit conditions affect job satisfaction and creativity differently. More specifically, environmental orientation fit produces greater job satisfaction and creativity when the employee and organization both demonstrate high concern for the environment (i.e., a high-high environmental orientation fit condition) than when both display congruent low concern for the environmental (i.e., a low-low environmental orientation fit condition). Furthermore, for employees working in organizations that fit their personal environmental orientation, strong regulatory pressure to comply with environmental standards diminishes the positive fit effect on job satisfaction and creativity, while regulatory pressure does not affect the job satisfaction and creativity of employees whose personal environmental orientation is incongruent with that of the organization. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Creativity; Environmental orientation; Job satisfaction; Person-organization fit",

Many of these dilemmas concern the capital that is generated (or the lack of it) through variations in the use of ethnic stakeholder social ties. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a stakeholder-based model of social capital formation, mediated by various forms of ethnic ties, to explore the duality of ethnicity: it can aid and hinder an ethnic business. Drawing upon the social capital/economic development, stakeholder salience, ethnic businesses literatures, and (to some extent) on social identity theory, we develop a cyclical model of relationships among ethnic business stakeholder attributes (ethnic kinship-based power, ethnic-moral legitimacy, and ethnic-critical urgency) and social capital, as mediated by three-way (triadic) Simmelian bonding and bridging ties, which then, in turn, affects the ethnic stakeholder attributes. We argue that the development of bridging yet strong ties through this cyclical process is relevant for the improvement of the positions of ethnic businesses in terms of both economic success and social responsibility. Specifically, we suggest that, given the duality of ethnicity in business, managers can prioritize stakeholder relationships based upon how these stakeholder ties affect social capital. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ethnic business; Ethnic-based social dilemmas; Simmelian ties; Social capital; Stakeholder salience",

A thematic analysis of student reflections (N = 96) based on their experience of material presented in their Business Ethics/Corporate Social Responsibility modules, interpreted through the framework of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, revealed that while negative role models led to intentions to avoid unethical behavior and engage in ethical practices such as ethical purchasing, they also increased cynicism and undermined students' self-efficacy in the ethical business domain. Exposure to positive role models offset the negative consequences arising from negative role models, protecting against reduced selfefficacy by showing that unethical behavior is neither necessary nor inevitable in business, thus undermining the common justification for unethical behavior that ""everybody does it."" PRMs increased awareness that business can be both ethical and profitable and provided inspirational role models that led to increased intentions to engage in ethical business practices.

Extant research demonstrates that CR is one of the key mediators between CSR and important organizational outcomes, which ultimately improve organizational performance. Yet, hitherto the research focused on CR construct has been plagued by multiple definitions, conflicting conceptualizations, and unclear operationalizations. The purpose of this article is to provide theoretical ground for positioning of CR as an assessment construct that is modeled as a second-order factor affecting individual first-order dimensions (having a reflective nature), and to provide methodological and empirical support toward such conceptualization. We assert that intangible, socially complex, and causally ambiguous CR (latent construct) can be accurately estimated through its individual measurable dimensions. Using survey data from Peru, we empirically test the hypothesized second-order reflective model within a hierarchy of nested and non-nested models, and compare its model fit and predictive power (nomological validity) with alternative conceptualizations. Modeling CR as a second-order reflective construct relies on a set of theoretical propositions and yields several methodological advantages, including strong conceptual interpretability and parsimony when tested within a nomological context. We explicitly demonstrate positive organizational outcomes of CR: customer trust, corporate identification, in-role behavior, and extra-role behavior. Then, we demonstrate that the shorter scales of CR can be used as a good proxy for the full construct measure.

The managerial action as a result of such strategic cognition suggests that modern organizations are seeking to develop CSR giving processes that provide them with a competitive advantage. We draw on the resource-based view of organizations and the VRIO framework to provide the theoretical foundations for our argument that CSR implementation in the form of corporate giving to charities can be developed as a dynamic capability. This can provide a competitive advantage by allowing organizations to manage key stakeholder relationships (external and internal) more effectively with benefits which could lead to increased organizational productivity and the ability to execute strategy more effectively. We interview CSR implementation managers from large organizations in Australia and find that the CSR giving process in many firms is evolving into a more sophisticated and strategically motivated process with expectations of a return. Central to this evolution is the appointment of a CSR implementation manager who acts as a boundary spanner between the organization and its key stakeholders. We posit that this corporate investment in their role and supporting structures can lead to the better management of stakeholders by organizations through the dynamic capability of the CSR giving process.

Further, our more parsimonious formative model illustrates that positive problem-focused coping and negative emotion-focused coping contribute to both affective and normative commitment. After controlling for gender and salespeople’s commission (from company’s personnel record) in separate analyses, results remain significant. We provide additional insights: Females are likely to use emotion-focused coping than males, but gender is not related to organizational commitment. Salespeople’s commission is positively related to both affective and normative commitment but unrelated to coping strategies. We shed new lights on boundary spanning employees’ Coping Intelligence and organizational commitment and offer theoretical, empirical, and practical implications to coping strategies and business ethics. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Action-focused; Affective; Boundary spanning; Continuance; Coping intelligence; Coping strategies; Emotion-focused; Ethics; Gender; Normative; Organizational commitment; Problem-focused; Sales commission; Stress",

These two nations have historical relationships and internal differences that are especially useful for testing hypotheses about nation compared to within-nation region differences. We develop hypotheses about the implications of religious heritage and urbanization for work goals based on functional, institutional and critical event explanations for regional culture differences. A number of work goals (notably extrinsic goals like pay) show too little difference between either nations or within-nation regions to consider them. For those work goals that do show region differences, the largest differences, those for job security goals and goals for working with pleasant people, are associated with region differences between rather than within the two nations. Regional differences in some work goals are also related to religious heritage. Regional differences in work goals have implications for the kinds of HR programs that managers may wish to promote in different locations. For example, the results suggest that HR managers have reason to anticipate that policies promoting job security may receive especially positive responses in Germany, whereas programs promoting social relationships may be best received in the Netherlands. Similarly, organizations that operate in both the north and south of each country should be alert to a number of possible within-nation differences in local optimal HR policies, but the within-nation differences found here are small enough that they should be carefully checked in specific organizations. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","country regions; cultural values; work goals; World Values Survey",

This chapter explores how customers accessed and responded to arts and cultural activities as well as how they were affected by social relationships. Data were collected from a sample of 1,387 respondents during an arts festival. The results show that most respondents of a traditional arts and culture activity comprised numerous families. The high level of satisfaction with the event enhanced the outcomes for future attendance.

Management educators and other stakeholders need to respond. To this end, we argue that a shared understanding amongst stakeholders concerning complexity and risk is both urgent and mutually beneficial. Ideally it would lead to collaborative design of curriculum and pedagogy and avoid overly narrow specialisation. We use the notion of 'holism' to explore the difficulties in comprehending the span of change in contemporary business, presenting 'holistic risk' as a vital but aspirational construct transcending boundaries, functions and disciplines. Specifically we address implications for teaching and learning holistic risk, for related program goals and curriculum design, and for embedding critical analytical skills into curriculum, arguing that students engage with holistic risk throughout the entire spectrum of problem-solving. Thus, educators must grapple with helping students in this effort. In support, we offer examples of our own practice in curriculum design and pedagogy. We conclude that the concept of holism might provoke a better understanding between educators and industry stakeholders concerning knowledge and skills to deal with risks associated with dynamic shifts in business environments. Such collaboration could help students operate more confidently in fluid, unpredictable business settings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Boundary objects; Complexity; Holistic risk; Management education; Social capital; Stakeholder engagement; Trans-disciplinarity",

Prescriptions for the repair of trust are offered along with the diagnosis. Design/methodology/approach – The theoretical underpinnings of the stakeholder trust model of organizations are supported using the literature in marketing and management. Case study data on large and community banks are used to explore differences in these type of banks as they relate to trustworthiness as articulated in the stakeholder trust model of organizations. Findings – The stakeholder trust model of organizations and six dimensions of trustworthiness help to explain why trust eroded in large banks during the GFC but increased or remained stable among some community banks. This diagnosis of the loss of trust also points to interventions that will be necessary to restore trust going forward among large banks. Research limitations/implications – Scholars in marketing need to develop a more macro view of the firm that examines trust beyond customers to reflect a wider stakeholder focus and issues of corporate social responsibility, trust reputation and license to operate. Practical implications – This paper points out strategic changes, some of which are radical, that will be required to restore and sustain stakeholder trust in large banks. Social implications – Building trustworthy banks is essential to social and economic progress. Originality/value – This paper addresses a void in marketing research by moving beyond the product and transactional level focus and framing a more macro oriented approach to understand trust in banks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Banks; Business ethics; Customer satisfaction; Financial services; Market orientation; Trust",

The paper specifically illustrates how patience, courage, honesty, integrity, and humility are integral to negative capability in the contexts of not knowing. Finally, the paper calls for deeper inquiry into the role of virtue ethics in preparing managers and leaders for not knowing and urges organizations to embrace negative capability in not knowing rather than engaging in damaging delusion. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Knowing; Negative capability; Not knowing; Virtue ethics",

This paper introduces a dynamic social network analysis framework in which this spread is conceptualized as the result of the reactions of perpetrators, victims, and observers to an initial act of unethical behavior. This theoretical framework shows that the social relationships of the actors involved in an initial act impact in multiple ways the likelihood that unethical behavior spreads. It reveals furthermore that social relationships may change in the wake of unethical behavior, such that indirect negative consequences can arise for organizations. The proposed framework provides a basis for the development of a formal stochastic actor-oriented model of network dynamics which would enable simulations of the spread of unethical behavior. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Contagion; Misconduct; Social network analysis; Spread; Unethical behavior",

In particular, interpersonal behavior in coaching remains unexplored, although it is considered highly relevant to social relationships and interaction outcomes. This study takes first steps to address this gap. Design/Methodology/Approach: We examined the dynamics of coaches’ and clients’ interpersonal behavior based on the two basic dimensions affiliation and dominance. Furthermore, we investigated the link between emergent interpersonal behavior patterns and coaching outcomes. To this end, we videotaped and analyzed a total of 11,095 behavioral acts nested in 30 coach–client dyads. Findings: Sequential analysis showed that reciprocal friendliness patterns were positively linked to working alliance. Coaches’ dominant–friendly interaction behavior particularly activated clients, in terms of showing dominance during the coaching interaction process. Clients’ dominance was linked to their overall goal attainment. Implications: Our results highlight the importance of interpersonal behavior for coaching success. Specifically, our findings suggest that dominance interaction patterns are context- and relation-specific, offering an explanation for contradicting empirical studies on interpersonal dominance. For coaches, our study implies that high awareness for interpersonal signals can help establish a positive atmosphere and activate clients’ dominance. Originality/Value: This empirical study uses behavior observation and interaction analysis to understand the interpersonal dynamics during coaching sessions.

We argue that CSP activities affect these two reputations differently. In addition, we empirically test the relationship among different types of CSP, reputation among public and financial stakeholders, and financial performance. Our results suggest that (1) Carroll’s four types of CSP (i.e., economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic) affect financial performance differently, and (2) their effects are mediated by reputation among public and financial stakeholders.

However, in order for firms to enhance stakeholder relationships, individuals must be made aware of firms' CSR activities. As a result, firms dedicate considerable resources to CSR-related advertisements. The current research proposes that, during recessionary periods, managers alter their CSR communications in response to perceived consumer retrenchment to purchase criteria such as price and quality. Using sensemaking as a framework, we predict that managers used cues from consumers during the recent recession, to alter their CSR communications strategies accordingly. We test our hypotheses through a content analysis of over 4000 print advertisements from 2006 to 2010. Our findings demonstrate that instead of lower levels of CSR communications during the recession, the odds of an advertisement containing CSR messages actually increased during the recession. However, the content of this advertising did change in concert with the sensemaking hypotheses. Specifically, during periods of economic decline, CSR messages were more likely to be integrated into ""mainstream"" advertising. We also find that the use of self-oriented appeals (e.g., cost savings due to energy efficiency) sharply increased during the period of economic decline. We highlight how managers can use these findings to increase the probability that CSR communications will deliver the expected relational benefits with consumers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This finding suggests that Confucianism has important influence on business ethics, and thus can serve as an important ethical philosophy or social norm to mitigate the controlling shareholder's unethical expropriation behavior. Moreover, my findings reveal that the nature of the ultimate owner attenuates the negative association between Confucianism and minority shareholder expropriation, suggesting that Confucianism's negative impact on minority shareholder expropriation is less pronounced for state-owned enterprises than for non-state-owned enterprises. The above results are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests and my findings are valid after controlling for the potential endogeneity between Confucianism and minority shareholder expropriation. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Confucianism; Geographic-proximity-based Confucianism variable; Minority shareholder expropriation; Other receivables; State-owned enterprises; The nature of the ultimate owner",

Much depends on the nature of their engagement. The stakeholder engagement process can be complex and unpredictable, more so if no strategic plan is put in place or if no systematic thinking is invested in the innovation. Stakeholder engagement in the innovation process in general and innovation diffusion in particular is examined in the context of construction. From a theoretical perspective, analysis of the effect of stakeholders could be expected to help in refining the innovation process so that it produces decisions and outcomes more likely to lead to successful innovation and diffusion. To cover diverse applications from product development to the drafting and implementation of national standards, 19 innovation projects were studied. Through a statistical analysis of stakeholder involvement, based on a Fisher's exact test, it was concluded that a structured process of engagement has to be an integral part of the innovation process. Accordingly, an explicit plan for communication and engagement with identified key stakeholders is necessary ex ante as a condition for successful innovation and diffusion. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction; Innovation diffusion; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder theory","Construction; Lead refining; Product development; Diverse applications; Innovation diffusion; Innovation projects; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder involvement; Stakeholder theory; Structured process; Systematic thinkings; Diffusion"

In this paper, we present a new model for analyzing the sustainability of infrastructure project alternatives from a stakeholder-centric perspective: the stakeholder-sensitive, social welfare-oriented sustainability benefit analysis model (S3 Model). The model evaluates infrastructure project alternatives based on a proposed sustainable construction social welfare function (SC-SWF). The SC-SWF is a measure of the collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to all stakeholders. It can help identify project solutions that offer social (group) welfare based on the social, environmental, and economic benefits to individual stakeholders. The theoretical foundation of the proposed SC-SWF is grounded in the areas of social choice theory and social welfare theory. The proposed model and its practical application are illustrated through a hypothetical case study. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by advancing the knowledge in the area of social welfare theory and the fundamental research in infrastructure system decision theory. The proposed analysis may guide infrastructure system decision making and may lead to better understanding of how to plan and design infrastructure systems in a way that maximizes the collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to stakeholders. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Benefit analysis; Project planning and design; Social choice theory; Social welfare theory; Stakeholder management; Sustainable infrastructure development","Algorithms; Decision making; Decision theory; Benefit analysis; Project planning; Social choice theory; Social welfare; Stakeholder management; Sustainable infrastructure; Sustainable development"

It has been assumed that all industries understand and apply the social licence to operate concept in a similar way, as previous research has tended to adopt a single-industry focus. This article is one of the first known cross-industry examinations of social licence to operate, comparing the use of this concept in four Australian energy industry contexts: mining, wind, carbon dioxide capture and storage, and geothermal. Semi-structured interviews with industry representatives were conducted to provide a comparison of views on the understanding and application of social licence to operate in these industries. The findings identified shared expectations of increasing stakeholder engagement in energy project development, and a view that a social licence to operate could guide this engagement. Yet the duration of use, the maturity of the industry, and the ways in which the industries related to the concept influenced the understanding and application of this concept. This research provides evidence of how the meaning and application of social licence to operate does vary between industries. Further exploration of community and government perspectives on social licence to operate is recommended in order to broaden the findings of this research. Such research will provide an emerging platform for encouraging discerning use of the concept by industries, and also practitioners who may be engaged across multiple industries.

This article employs strong environmental reputation as a proxy for high environmental performance and explores implications for the well-established alliance formation trust-based mechanism, under the strategic cognition perspective. The ensuing hypotheses are subjected to empirical scrutiny through an experimental method. A random sample of 138 CEOs and top managers of Norwegian manufacturing firms completed a scenario-based questionnaire. The results show that two out of three trust dimensions are affected and, moreover, that two out of three-but not the same-trust dimensions influence partner attractiveness.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) currently is the best defined system to analyse the environmental aspects, and is capable to analyse circular systems, Product Service Systems, and systems for recycling. However LCA falls short of analysis of the added value of business models. Since new sustainable business models are part of the transition towards a circular economy, there is a need for combined analyses of value and eco-burden.This paper applies the LCA-based Eco-costs Value Ratio (EVR) Model to analyse potential negative environmental effects of business initiatives on a system level, and to provide a theoretical approach to the design of sustainable business models by means of a three dimensional approach of costs, eco-costs and market value. Two methods are applied for analysis and design: Eco-efficient Value Creation (EVR benchmarking) and the Circular Transition Framework (describing stakeholder activities which are required for the transition towards sustainable business models).The practical case of the analysis, design and implementation of a business model for sustainable water recreation in Friesland (a province in the Netherlands) is used to validate the usefulness of these two LCA-based methods.The conclusion is that the approach of Eco-efficient Value Creation helps to avoid many pitfalls of the design of circular business models (e.g. having a positive result on product level, but having a negative effect on societal level; having a positive effect on the environment but having insufficient customer perceived value to overcome fierce market competition). The Circular Transition Framework reveals pitfalls and opportunities in implementation (e.g. the coordination between business models and governmental policies). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Circular transition framework; Eco-costs; Eco-efficient value creation; Environment; Product-service system; Sustainability","Commerce; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Design; Ecodesign; Product design; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Circular transitions; Eco-costs; Environment; Product-service systems; Value creation; Life cycle"

The development trajectories of such studies should be articulated with a view to informing practical corporate social responsibility applications and theoretical studies in the future. This paper presents a critical review of relevant empirical research articles on the nexus between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance published during the ten-year period from 2002 to 2011. Using mixed-methods of content analyses and statistical analyses, the paper reviews 84 empirical studies of this kind published during the period. The results indicate that, despite the enormous amount of previous studies, the corporate social performance and corporate financial performance nexus is a line of inquiry that remains inconclusive. The pattern of corporate social performance-corporate financial performance relationship research in the decade examined has shifted towards exploring the linkages between specific aspects of the two constructs. The positive relationships between these specific aspects in dual directions are confirmed by most of the studies examined in this paper. The paper also examines the impact of time and space change on the corporate social performance-corporate financial performance nexus. The findings show that researchers have gradually recognized that the relationship is not static but changes over time. Furthermore, the paper finds that corporate social responsibility has been increasingly debated in developing countries and in specified industrial settings. The review concludes that to explore the corporate social performance-corporate financial performance nexus by contextualizing it in a specified community, and/or examine its dynamics is a promising research area that can yield significant academic and practical values. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Scholasticism, developed between the thirteenth and the mid-seventeenth centuries, deals with key elements of free market morality, including private property, contracts, profits, prices, and free competition. For over 500 years Scholasticism tried to understand economic phenomena and business activities and reflected on them from an ethical perspective. Scholasticism offered the crucial lesson of the centrality of justice and the role of practical wisdom in considering market morality. Justice is seen as both a virtue and a principle, and commutative justice (justice in exchanges) with the common good of society as the reference for the Scholastics, is regarded as being especially important. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Aquinas; Business ethics; Capitalism; Christian ethics; Contracts; Economic ethics; Free market; Just price; Market morality; Private propriety; Scholasticism",

The fraud triangle specifies three main factors, i.e. opportunity, incentive, and rationalization. On the one hand, analysts may reduce the fraud opportunity factor through external monitoring aimed at discouraging managerial misconduct, which can moderate agency problems. On the other hand, analysts may increase the fraud incentive factor by pressurizing managers to achieve short-term performance targets, which can exacerbate agency problem. In either case, the potential influence of analysts on the fraud rationalization factor may be more pronounced among firms that are more dependent on the capital market for corporate finance. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms, we show a negative association between corporate fraud propensity and analyst coverage, and that this effect is more pronounced among non-state-owned enterprises, which are more reliant on the stock market for external funding. These findings suggest that analyst coverage contributes to corporate fraud deterrence in emerging economies characterized by weak investor protection. The main policy implication is that further development of the analyst profession in emerging economies may benefit investors and strengthen business ethics. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Agency problem; Analyst coverage; China; Corporate fraud; Fraud triangle",

These regulatory sanctions are prima-facie evidence of significant lapses in business ethics. During the period 2003–2010, 302-person-time independent directors were penalized by the regulator (the China Securities Regulatory Commission—the CSRC), and the two stock exchanges. We find that the independent directors with accounting experiences are more likely to be penalized by the CSRC, though they do not suffer more severe penalties than do the other sanctioned independent directors. We also find that independent directors suffer less severe penalties than do the insider directors. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the sanctions on independent directors are tied to their assumed ethical and legal responsibilities. Following a regulatory sanction, penalized independent directors experience a significant decline in the number of other board seats held. However, they can gain board seats in better quality firms. We find that interlocked firms that share penalized independent directors with the fraud firm do not suffer from a valuation decline. Overall, our results suggest that regulatory sanctions have not triggered further sanctions on the penalized directors in the labor market but they have, instead, created a disincentive for these directors to serve on the company boards of high-risk firms. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Business ethics; Financial fraud; Independent directors; Regulatory sanctions; Reputational damage in the labor market",

They take advantage of low hurdles for listing via reverse mergers and avoid third-party monitoring through poor governance and auditors.

During the past decade we have witnessed an increase in the amount of literature on applying ancient wisdom in the context of business leadership. In the Asian context, the ancient literature from India and China is pregnant with several lessons which are relevant and useful for business leadership. Among the literature from the Indian context, the Bhagavad-Gita is one of the most popular and most cited by many scholars and practitioners in the field of business leadership. However, based on a survey of business leadership literature from the Bhagavad-Gita, very few works are found on the pressing and important topic of business ethics. Therefore, in this chapter the author attempts to explore and incorporate the ethical principles found in the Bhagavad-Gita into business leadership. In presenting the business ethics from the Bhagavad-Gita, the author has employed hermeneutics, which is a qualitative methodology used for the interpretation of ancient literatures. The Bhagavad-Gita advocates a consciousness and a spirit-centered approach to the subject of business ethics based on eternal values and moral principles that should govern the conduct of business leaders.

We conducted a comparative case study analysis over a period of 13 years (1997–2009) for two organizations—Exxon and BP—that took extreme (but different) initial stances on climate change. We found that as stakeholder pressures rose, their IM tactics unfolded in four phases: (i) advocating the initial stance, (ii) sensegiving to clarify the initial stance, (iii) image repairing, and (iv) adjusting the stance. Taken together, our analysis of IM over these four phases provides three key insights about the evolution of IM in the face of rising pressures. First, when faced with stakeholder pressures, it seems that organizations do not immediately resort to conforming but tend to give in gradually when pressures increase and start to come from relatively powerful stakeholders. Second, evolution of IM seems to be characterized by path dependence, i.e., even as organizations’ positions evolve, they continue to show their conviction in their initial positions and try to convey that their subsequent positions flow logically from the previous ones.

Since attitudes predict intentions and behaviors, Monetary Intelligence, a form of social intelligence, is defined as the extent to which individuals monitor their own monetary motive, behavior, and cognition; apply the information to evaluate critical concerns and options; select strategies to achieve financial goals; and reach ultimate success and subjective well-being. I theorize that the affective (love of money motive) aspect of MI is unrelated to perceptions of “course work,” yet it is positively related to their “personal values” toward making money, but negatively related to making ethical decisions. Individuals with high MI (low affective love of money motive) have low interests in making money, but high levels of intrinsic religiosity and recall of the Ten Commandments and high interests in making ethical decisions and making the grade (objective academic performance). Based on data from multiple panels and multiple sources, this study provides the following discoveries. Contrary to expectations, there are no differences in students’ perceptions of course work and their personal values toward making money and making ethical decisions between two measures—before and after the ethics intervention. Results of this study not only provide empirical supports for the bright side of theory of Monetary Intelligence (MI, Monetary Quotient, MQ) but also reveal a new paradox—recall of the Ten Commandments (the priming effect) is positively related to making ethical decisions, but negatively related to making money. Results illustrate important theoretical, empirical, and practical implications to the literature of money attitudes, religiosity, intrinsic motivation, and business ethics. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Affective love of money motive; Attitudes; Intrinsic motivation; Intrinsic religiosity; Making ethical decisions; Making money; Making the grade; Monetary Intelligence; MQ; The Ten Commandments",

However, remanufacturing must not be treated as a panacea for achieving a sustainable business, as issues such as market demand, product design, end of life condition and information uncertainty can affect the success of a remanufacturing endeavour. Businesses therefore need to carefully assess the feasibility of adopting remanufacturing before committing to a particular activity or strategy. To aid this decision process, a number of tools and techniques have been published by academics. However, there is currently not a formal review and comparison of these tools and how they relate to the decision process. The main research objective of this study has therefore been to identify tools and methods which have been developed within academia to support the decision process of assessing and evaluating the viability of conducting remanufacturing, and evaluate how they have met the requirements of the decision stage. This has been achieved by conducting a content analysis. Three bibliographic databases were searched (Compendex, Web of Science and Scopus) using a structured keyword search to identify relevant literature. The identified tools were then split into 6 categories based upon the specific decision stages and applications, then evaluated against a set of key criteria which are, the decision factors (economic, environmental, social) and the inclusion of uncertainty. The key finding of this study has been that although decision factors are generally well covered, operational tools and the use of uncertainty are often neglected. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Four hundred ten management students from two technical institutes in eastern India participated in this study. Along with the socio-demographic variables in the questionnaire, inventories were used to assess gender roles, ethical attitudes, ethical behaviors, and corporate responsibility values. The inventories had acceptable reliability and validity. The results suggested that when the confounding effects of age, caste, and rural/urban origin are controlled, women manifest higher corporate responsibility values than men, but they embody similar ethical attitudes and ethical behaviors as men. Furthermore, the feminine roles of the participants were found to be more consistent, potent, and direct predictors of ethical attitudes, ethical behaviors, and corporate responsibility values than the biological sex.

As opposed to local firms, multinational firms are usually exposed to global pressure groups both in home and host countries. In addition, in order to gain license to operate in foreign markets, they are required to be regarded as socially responsible agents that contribute to sustainable development. Finally, apart from the moral reasons, high levels of corporate social performance will lead multinational enterprises to increase their reputation and legitimacy in the areas where they have operations and consequently increase their revenues and levels of financial performance. Traditionally, the literature has focused on studying the relationship between international diversification and corporate results, with very few studies on the effects of internationalisation on firms’ social performance. The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of international cultural diversification of a multinational enterprise on its corporate social performance and to investigate the moderating effect of slack financial resources on this relationship. The present empirical analysis is based on a sample of 113 multinational enterprises from the United States that operate in the chemical, energy and industrial sectors. The results demonstrate that international cultural diversification is positively correlated with the social performance of firms and that a high level of slack financial resources leads multinational enterprises operating in markets with different cultural profiles to improve their corporate social performance.

We offer an alternative interpretation, arguing that corporations invoke consumers' sense of shared responsibility for realizing public goods in order to mobilize consumers to engage in boycotting and buycotting behaviors. Using a representative sample of adults living in urban areas of Brazil, bivariate and multivariate analyses are performed to test the relative weight of these different explanations.

Lessons are drawn from a case study of how regulatory, economic incentive, informative and procurement policies have supported Energy Service Company (ESCo) activity in the UK; a sub-set of the PSS family focused on energy service provision. Subsequently five policy recommendations are presented to support PSS activity: (1) balancing economic incentives and regulatory disincentives; (2) promoting indirect policy support; (3) redesigning existing market structures; (4) promoting locally-led PSS activity; and (5) creating stable policy frameworks. The paper warns however that national government policy cannot easily address all PSS barriers, such as customer preferences, international developments, technological progress and inherent business model weaknesses, pointing to the need for other complementary solutions. Furthermore, other governance actors beside national government could also implement PSS supporting policies. © 2015 The Authors.","Energy Service Company (ESCo); Government 'demand pull' policy; Innovation system; Product Service System (PSS); Sustainable business model","Commerce; Energy service companies (ESCos); Energy service company; Innovation system; International development; Policy recommendations; Product-service systems; Productservice system (PSS); Sustainable business; Public policy"

In the context of growing consensus on the need of balancing social prosperity and business profits, concern is increasing for introducing business (and particularly accounting) ethics in higher education curricula. The purpose is to improve ethical behaviour of future business people, and of accounting professionals in particular. In this study, from a sample of 551 business students at a Spanish university, the importance of accounting ethics is investigated. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we attempt to examine students’ overall perceptions of business ethics in unfriendly environments and, specifically, their views on the importance and goals of accounting ethics education. Second, we intend to investigate whether potential differences in such perceptions depend on previous business ethics courses taken, gender, and age of students. Our results show that those students who have previously taken an ethics course are especially prone to considering that accounting education should include ethical considerations, and show greater interest in further introducing this subject in their curricula. These facts should encourage universities offering business degrees in ethics-unfriendly environments to extend the implementation of ethics courses in their curricula. Besides, significant differences in students’ perceptions on the importance of accounting ethics are found depending on their gender and age. In line with previous research findings, female and older students show more ethical inclinations than, respectively, male and younger students. Thus, ethics-unfriendly environments can be treated as contexts where general trends on students’ ethical attitudes are also clearly visible. This fact, together with the evidenced impact of ethics courses on students’ ethical inclinations, places ethics-unfriendly environments as crucial research settings for further inquiring into the nuances that help explain students’ attitudes towards accounting ethics and the role of ethics courses in business degree curricula. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Accounting ethics; Business ethics; Ethics-unfriendly environments; Higher education",

Based on the qualitative analysis of interviews with 23 individuals who have pioneered institutions and initiatives around corporate responsibility, we find two predominant pathways to vision. The deliberate path starts with aspiration and moves through purpose toward a relatively intentional vision that ultimately leads to, and is subsequently informed by, action. The emergent path also begins with aspiration then moves directly to action and only retrospectively to a sense of a vision behind the actions taken. The emergent path, in which action precedes vision, is contrary to the dominant assumption that vision leads to action in an entrepreneurial context and may be further characterized as either inadvertent or developmental. In advancing a conceptual model of the vision–action or action–vision trajectories of social entrepreneurs, this study highlights the iterative nature of vision. This study also demonstrates the importance of considering formative experiences that contribute to the aspiration to make some kind of a difference in the world, a sense of purpose or intentions, and core values and beliefs in examining the ethicality of social entrepreneurship. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Developmental vision; Emergent vision; Entrepreneurial action; Entrepreneurial vision; Social entrepreneurship; Vision",

In this manner, employment contracts can be regarded as both a CSR and Business Ethics (BE) issue. Treating your employees in a respectable way represents the most basic form of corporate responsibility and respectable ethics.

By drawing on these disciplines for both method and texts, we can more easily make the connection to business as a fully human activity, concerned with how meaning is created. Students are encouraged to understand story-telling and narrative and how these tools lend insight into the daily life of businesspeople. The paper describes two main courses, Business Ethics Through Literature and Leadership, Ethics and Theater, and the rationale for each. We begin by suggesting three main leverage points that the courses engender. We then rely on the words of students who have taken the courses for insights into what they learned. We then critically assess some of the principles that have informed course design over time. We conclude by suggesting that paying attention to the creative arts gives rise to a rather different approach to business ethics, one grounded in the pragmatist tradition in philosophy. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics and humanities; Collaboration and trust; Creative arts and business ethics; Leveraging creative arts; Literature and theater; Teaching Business ethics",

The chapter postulates that CSR stakeholder categories are intangible assets of every firm, small or large. As such assets, CSR stakeholders contribute to the current capital valuation of the firm. If their asset quality increases, so does the value of the firm. Conversely, if their asset quality decreases and becomes more of a liability, the value of the firm decreases proportionally. Under this approach, re-conceptualized balance sheets must become a more important tool for business owners and managers to use to enhance the relevance and the quality of their CSR efforts. © 2015, IGI Global.",,

Starbucks's evolution in developing sustainability programs and their sustainability reporting over a 12-year period are examined as a case example.

Hence, knowledge that exists within an organization is a sustainable source of competitive advantage, which makes Knowledge Management (KM) a critical input in the growth of any organization and more so in the case of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Even though much has been researched and written on the subject of knowledge management in large and multinational organizations, very little focus and research has been done on KM in SMEs. Globalization of supply chains, rapid technological advances, superior returns on intellectual capital, and the growing importance of knowledge-intensive industries make KM a strategic tool in the growth and success of all businesses. Access and integration of SMEs with regional, national, and international supply chains require bridging the gaps between the requirements of supply chains and efficiency of SMEs' KM systems. KM-enabled SMEs are essential for competitive and sustainable growth. Hence, a judicious approach for KM in SMEs is a must in the current scenario. The overall mission of this chapter is to aid researchers in recognizing and understanding the knowledge management spectrum for small and medium enterprises in a globalized world.

When present economic conditions and management practices are criticised, Adam Smith is referred to by defenders and detractors of the current status quo alike. Smith, it is believed, defined the essential terms of reference of these debates, such as the rational pursuit of self-interest on part of the individual and the resultant optimal allocation of goods in free markets thanks to the workings of an “invisible hand.” In this article, we question whether this standard view of Smith, the economist, is tenable. We provide an extensive review of the extant secondary literature from economists, business ethicists, and philosophers, comparing their assessments to crucial elements of Smith’s theoretical system. As a result, we show that Smith, far from being an advocate of a value-free or even value-averse conception of economic transactions, stood for a virtue-based and values-oriented model of business. Accordingly, we argue current management education and the pedagogy of business ethics ought to be changed, and certain strategic conclusions drawn for business practice. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Adam Smith; Business ethics; Economic theory; Epistemology; Virtue ethics",

Using a sample of Chinese listed firms during the period of 2001–2011 and geographic-proximity-based Confucianism variables, I provide strong and consistent evidence to show that Confucianism is significantly negatively associated with board gender diversity, suggesting that the proportion of women directors in the boardroom is significantly lower for firms surrounded by strong Confucianism atmosphere than for firms located in regions with weak Confucianism atmosphere. This finding also implies that Confucian philosophical system has important impacts on business ethics and women’s status in corporate governance. Moreover, GDP per capita, the proxy for economic development level in a province in which a firm is located, attenuates the negative association between Confucianism and board gender diversity. Above results are robust to different measures of Confucianism and board gender diversity and are still valid after controlling for the potential endogeneity between Confucianism and board gender diversity. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Board gender diversity; Confucianism; GDP per capita; Geographic-proximity-based Confucianism variable; Women directors in the boardroom",

The Kantian ethics of duty proves to be the key link between these, as particularly relevant for cases where the impact on a wide range of stakeholders is considerable. The main case under consideration is the controversial USD $2 billion Romanian mining project at Roşia Montana, which highlights the need for accountability mentioned above and lends itself well to a multi-fold business ethics analysis. The role of the civil society in effectively stopping the project is a good illustration of the stakeholder theory.

We adopt a Bayesian approach that enables exact inferences concerning the model's parameters and handles missing data by random imputations, thus increasing the study's reliability.

The paper also aims to provide a roadmap for integrating sustainable business practices using information systems (IS) approach of continuous improvement lifecycle. Current business practices try to achieve economic, social and ecological goals independently as silos due to the individual operational challenges posed by each of these TBL principles. Design/methodology/approach - The research design mainly adopts a quantitative research methodology with data collected by means of a survey questionnaire that included both descriptive and exploratory flavour. The empirical study examines the relationships of TBL elements as perceived by 85 different Australian-based large, medium as well as small business organisations. The data collected were analysed by performing factor analysis on 21 items, resulting in three latent factors that were aligned to TBL outcomes and the correlations among them were analysed to assess their inter-relationships. Findings - The results of the study report weak and positive relationships existing between the TBL elements, with insights gained through the study leading towards useful implications that are well-supported by the qualitative feedback. The empirical study has also resulted in providing practical recommendations and an implementation framework consisting of a four-step roadmap with the participation of quality circles within an IS approach. Practical implications - The study focuses on inter-relationships and integration of TBL elements in Australian businesses. This could be extended to other businesses in different countries. The proposed roadmap with a continuous improvement cycle of system implementation steps facilitates any organisation to adopt an incremental integration of the social responsibility and environment protection practices within its core business operations for achieving corporate sustainability. Originality/value - While most of the TBL studies conducted worldwide focus on predominantly assessing large organisations towards responsible and sustainable business practices, this paper considers large, medium and small businesses. The research methodology adopted in this study as well as the proposed IS approach with quality circles add value to a growing body of literature with a recent increasing focus on integrated approaches for corporate sustainability.","Corporate sustainability; Information system integration; Quality circles; Triple bottom line",

Employer attractiveness is becoming more important in order to win the most talented junior staff. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how corporate social performance (CSP) profiles of logistics companies influence their attractiveness for job seekers. Design/methodology/approach – In a computerized laboratory experiment, the authors provided 95 students in their final year with job offer data that include general and CSP information about the company, and the job seeker’s potential salary. The authors manipulated how the CSP information was presented and monitored the information accessed during job seekers’ decision-making processes. The authors investigated how information presentation affected choices. Findings – The vast majority of talent acquires CSP information in the pre-decision phase of the judgment, compares this information across companies, and trades off this information with the conditions of employment. The authors find that the ease of comparability of corporate social responsibility (CSR) information, expressed by meaningful indicators of CSP, increased preference for high CSP. Research limitations/implications – The study enriches existing studies of voluntary disclosure, which argue that voluntary disclosing sustainability-related information can be a tool of impression management. Practical implications – Companies with a compelling CSP should push for a broadly accepted methodology to benchmark CSP within industry-specific sectors, such as logistics services. Social implications – Potential employees demand that companies should consider their social impact on individuals and society as a whole. To remain attractive for employees companies in transport and logistics industry have to cope with a broader scope of expectations. Originality/value – The authors provide the first analysis on the relevance of CSP information for employer attractiveness in the transport and logistics industry. This research provides insights into the relevance of CSP criteria, information provision, and comparability processes from the perspective of young job seekers.

Concerning the selection of the measure of performance, we chose stock prices as a proxy for financial performance, in order to measure the perception and reaction of financial markets to the companies’ socially responsible behaviors. Using different social performance indicators concerning environment, community and employment activities, we found evidence that a good social performance has a negative influence on stock prices in the Italian Stock Exchange Market. This phenomenon is particularly evident if the environmental strategies of the Italian listed companies are considered. Hence, the Italian investors perceive these practices as avoidable expenses reducing shareholders’ income and companies’ value and recognize a negative market premium, in terms of lower stock prices, to socially responsible enterprises. This evidence is consistent with the peculiarities of the Italian capitalism structure, which, because of its backwardness in CSR topics and related issues, seems to be not yet mature enough to evaluate appropriately the value of these policies. © 2015 Virtus Interpress.

We differentiate between strengths and concerns in stakeholder management to demonstrate the differential effects of the two aspects of stakeholder management. Previous research on stakeholder theory often focuses on the importance of stakeholder relations, trying to build a business case of relational capital that results from strong stakeholder management. Such a relational approach, however, overlooks the process of managing stakeholders, a process that allows firms with strengths in stakeholder management to develop an important capability of managing tensions. In this study, we argue that this capability, an inherent part of stakeholder management, can be critical when firms face increased complexity during the process of international diversification. We therefore propose that strengths in stakeholder management are positively related to international diversification, while concerns in stakeholder management are negatively related to international diversification. Using panel data for 169 US multinational firms over a 10-year period, we find support that strengths in stakeholder management facilitate international diversification.

The influence and effect of EEB at the functional level, however, is under-researched. Similarly, the management of risk in the supply chain has become a practical concern for many firms. It is important that managers have a good understanding of the risks associated with supplier partnerships. This paper examines the effect of firms investment in EEB as part of corporate social responsibility in mediating the relationship between supply chain partnership (SCP) and management appreciation of the risk of partnering. We hypothesise that simply entering into a SCP does not facilitate an appreciation of the risk of partnering and may even hamper such awareness. However, such an appreciation of the risk is facilitated through CRs environmental and stakeholder management ethos. The study contributes further by separating risk into distinct relational and performance components. The results of a firm-level survey confirm the mediation effect, highlighting the value to supply chain strategy and design of investing in EEB on three fronts: building internal awareness, monitoring and sharing best practice. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","corporate responsibility; environmental and ethical behaviour; mediation; performance risk; relational risk; supplier partnerships","Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Mergers and acquisitions; Philosophical aspects; Risk management; Supply chains; Corporate responsibility; environmental and ethical behaviour; mediation; Performance risk; supplier partnerships; Environmental and ethical behaviour; Supply chain management"

To ensure an applied exploration of SLO, this paper focused on the wind industry. Design/methodology/approach – Telephone interviews were conducted with 18 wind industry representatives responsible for stakeholder engagement in Australia. Questions focused upon understanding of consultation and SLO, perceptions of SLO in practice, and experiences regarding community engagement. Findings – SLO is broadly understood by the case study wind industry representatives as majority acceptance held by community and other stakeholders, although no common definition was expressed. This indicates that the concept has not transferred clearly or directly to the wind industry. Despite this, the benefits of seeking an SLO through consultative and ongoing communication practices were recognised across the wind industry as a positive risk mitigation strategy. Research limitations/implications – Future research could examine the understanding and communication approaches of SLO in other industries, cultures and geographic locations. Practical implications – It appears the wind industry intends to seek an SLO more broadly from the Australian public, beyond specific projects. This is likely to occur within the context of increased scrutiny on the performance of many industries and by the changing expectations and demands of communities. Social implications – Some wind corporations were considered to have previously conducted poor or shallow consultation, and this was perceived to have negatively affected the reputation of the wider industry. Mismanagement of expectations prior to the development phase was of particular concern to interviewees. Given this, an SLO could be put at risk by the poor or insufficient engagement and communication processes and reputation of their predecessors.

The authors demonstrate how the CSR field can benefit by combining or integrating multiple perspectives that bear on the social context, and by engaging in more explicit multilevel analysis of the social context within which CSR practicesunfold.

The authors conduct the study on 255 directorships in the boards of 20 listed companies in France, which participate in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 2010. Findings - The results show that director's background and nationality diversity in the board are the most relevant attributes to discerning firms with high CSR scores. However, the relationship between board interlocks and CSR is not consistent. Some explanations are reported and discussed. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to recognize the most influential variables in board composition for firms with high CSR scores, although it is based on a conceptual development and an explorative analysis.

Design/methodology/approach – This study tested these relationships through canonical correlation analyses. The data used were drawn from corporate HQ and 63 subsidiaries, which were publicly listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange in 2007. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used in the study. Findings – The results generally indicated that the isomorphism between the CSR practices of the HQ and those of their subsidiaries could impact both the CSP, especially the product and employee dimensions, and the CFP. No relationship was found to exist between the CSP and CFP. Originality/value – Despite extensive interest by scholars and practitioners in the subject area, relatively little is known about the management of CSR by the multinational enterprises (MNEs) (Meyer, 2004), as the literature does not systematically examine the effects that occur on employee performance following the diffusion of CSR among the MNEs subsidiaries. Extending earlier literature on CSR, by integrating the effect of the CFP, the present study focuses on the effects of isomorphism between the CSR practices of the MNEs and those of their subsidiaries on both CSP and CFP. Further, the study examined the interrelation of CSP and CFP from the perspective of international management. Given the increased interest in corporate governance matters at the international level, CSR plays a central and fundamentally important role in the corporate governance of the MNEs because of both globalization forces and the pressures exerted by stakeholders. In this context, this paper is one of the first to explore the transfer of CSR practices from the MNEs to their subsidiaries. The effect of CSR on performance is an important research question, especially for emerging markets (Ibrahim and Angelidis, 1995; Waddock and Graves, 1997; Ghazali, 2007; Johnson and Greening, 1999). Despite the importance of this issue, however, until recently, only a limited discussion has been evident in the literature on CSR in the international arena with particular reference given to the emerging economies. Studying the effects of the CSR isomorphism on the performance in Turkish context is justified in three ways. First, Turkey is the largest emerging economy in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East (Tatoglu et al., 2003, p. 7). It presents the emerging nature of the market and the transitional characteristics of the institutional environment (Cavusgil et al., 2002). Second, the drivers for CSR in Turkey, such as the other emerging markets whose institutional characteristics and economic fundamentals is similar, are exogenous and institutional rather than endogenous factors (Ararat and Gocenoglu, 2006, p. 11). Excluding the philanthropic activities, the very first manifestations of CSR were observed in the business conduct of MNEs in Turkey (Ararat and Gocenoglu, 2006, p. 11). MNEs have a dominant and leader role in Turkey for CSR practices. Finally, the subsidiaries operating in Turkey are less likely to resist the transfer of the organizational policies and practices such as human resource management policies (Sayim, 2010, 2011) and organizational culture (Ilhan, 2008). In fact, they want to even transfer the policies and practices from MNEs (Sayim 2010, 2011; Ilhan, 2008). Therefore, Turkish context provides a good case to test the effects of the CSR isomorphism on the performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance; Institutional theory; Isomorphism; Social performance; Turkey",

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to understand smokers and non-smokers views of CSR activities by Indonesian tobacco companies. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from a large private university in Surabaya, Indonesia. There were 191 usable questionnaires with 91.7 per cent male and 8.3 per cent female. The number of smokers and non-smokers were evenly split, 49 per cent smokers and 51 per cent non-smokers which is slightly lower than the 67 per cent of male smokers in Indonesia. Of the 94 smokers in the sample, 69 per cent reported smoking on a daily basis. Findings – The results of this study suggest that CSR activities are able to cultivate favourable images of the tobacco companies especially for those who are currently smoking. CSR in the domain of the tobacco industry increases people’s favourable association with the company. Moreover, the findings show that consumer-company identification does not affect company evaluation (CE) and consumer sensitivity towards corporate social performance becomes a motivator which positively affects CE among smokers. Practical implications – This study has important implications for social marketing practice and research where the dominant focus remains on the downstream. In the case of smoking in Indonesia social marketing efforts directed towards mid and upstream may be more effective than downstream social marketing interventions which have to compete with global tobacco corporations. Originality/value – This is one of the first studies to explore the impact of CSR and one of the first studies to examine Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country which exhibits a very high male smoking rate. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Corporate identity; Corporate image; Social responsibility",

We examine changes underpinning managers' prioritization of stakeholders and focus on how managers' attention to salient stakeholders is represented and communicated in a firm's accounting and reporting system. We study the emergence and development of Social Return on Investment (SROI): an accounting methodology intended to permit managers both to incorporate stakeholders' voices and to communicate the social value created by the firm for those stakeholders. We find that the ability of SROI to account for specific stakeholders, thus categorizing them as salient for the firm, is shaped by managers' epistemic beliefs and by the organization's material conditions. Our findings contribute to stakeholder theory by showing that the prioritization of stakeholders is not solely a managerial decision, but instead is dependent on the construction of an appropriate accounting and reporting system, as shaped by managers' epistemic beliefs and by the organization's material conditions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.","Social accounting; Social return on investment; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder prioritization; Stakeholder salience; Value creation",

The authors examine this question in the unique context of Major League Baseball’s (MLB) relationship with the “buscones” (agents) representing prospects from the Dominican Republic. Design/methodology/approach-Using game theory, the authors model how MLB teams create rules to curb unethical behavior within the supply chain. The principal relationship the authors will model is that of the franchises and the prospects. This relationship has as its core an investment decision by the individual franchises: Should they incur costs to ameliorate the context in which the prospects find themselves, or not? The costs of investment, whether it is in academies, general education, a revision of recruiting policies or something else, must be weighed against the negative externalities that are likely to result if the exploitation of the DR recruits becomes common knowledge to other stakeholders, particularly the public. Findings-The model shows that when investments are roughly evenly distributed, the teams successfully vote to outlaw unethical behaviors and thus collectively avoid the negative externalities. However, when investments are asymmetric, the teams invested in the current system vote against a ban to maintain a competitive edge, even though the system imposes costs on all of those involved.

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative self-administered survey was conducted with a convenience sample of Vietnamese business students at a banking university in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This study used the 30-item Attitudes Toward Business Ethics Questionnaire (ATBEQ) constructed by Neumann and Reichel (1987) based on the work of Stevens (1979). The Vietnamese version questionnaire was distributed, and 282 surveys were used for analysis. An item-by-item analysis was conducted based on gender and the experience of having taken a business ethics course. Findings – Significant differences were found on seven items based on gender and four items based on the experience of having taken a business ethics course. However, respondents appeared to have similar attitudes on the majority of the items. Research limitations/implications – Perhaps the greatest limitation of this study is the relatively uneven distribution of the respondents in the sample. The sample is skewed slightly toward women who are a bit older, fourth year or post-graduate and those who have not taken a business ethics course. In addition convenience sampling technique reduced its generalizability. This study is important because it supports the idea of ethics education to improve ethical decision-making of future business leaders and that education has an effect in Vietnam. Practical implications – As business students are the main subjects of this research, it can be useful for those involved in development of management and business education in Vietnam to have an overview on how gender impacts business students’ ethics perception. For the executives of multinational corporations, this study provides important information and adds support to a decision to do business in Vietnam. Social implications – Although there may be a perception of a less than ethical climate in Vietnam based on its Corruption Perception Index scores, it appears that Vietnamese business students in general express an ethical viewpoint. This study emphasizes the importance of ethics education that is culture-specific to build a strong ethical business environment that can help Vietnam prevent bribery and corruption and achieve sustainable growth and prosperity.

Governance is important in the management of stakeholders in order to be entrepreneurial while being accountable. Stakeholders support the organization based on legitimacy that is gained through creating stakeholder value and by conforming to existing social structures as well as creating new operating models, practices and ideas. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","identity; opportunity; Social entrepreneurship; stakeholders",

However, actual stakeholder engagement processes are complex and problematic. While considerable research has been conducted in developed tourist markets, this study aims to determine stakeholder engagement in tourism planning in a developing country: the Penang Island in Malaysia. Semi-structured interviews with governmental agencies, industry associations, and community stakeholders were conducted to look at their views on the engagement process with the local authority (LA) and the current barriers to success. The findings revealed that the existing engagement process with the LA is insufficient and ineffective, and the key barrier to improvement is the unclear roles and responsibilities of the multitude of federal, state and local government entities that are involved in tourism planning and development, and also lack of clear tourism strategy at the state and local levels. Hence, there is a clear need to delineate the responsibilities of the parties involved, improve coordination, strengthen collaboration with the stakeholders through improved and effective communication channels, and apply a participatory approach of early and on-going engagement in tourism planning and development. © A.K.

The literature review is supported by a discussion on CR strategies in 10 major ports around the world. The paper argues that ports tend to replicate environmental strategies across regions and learn from each other, and that a competitive focus on logistics tends to strengthen the importance of CR and in particular of environmental performance in ports. For some ports CR has become an integral part of their value creation proposition mostly as a result of competitive pressure.

As a consequence business ethics was not very alert to anticipate, to predict or to prevent the recent crises in the IT and the banking sector.

These two ways are: (1) adding psychological realism; and (2) testing some quasi-empirical assumptions present in normative theory. In order to make good our methodological claim, we first describe the methodological rules of experimental economics, distinguishing this method from other behavioral business ethics approaches.

China currently has business ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) concerns primarily because its economy is in evolution. As the Chinese economy is in transition from the late 1970s from a command-Communist economy to a more hybrid system Beijing model (a system based on a capitalist market controlled through bureaucracy), much has to be understood if one wants to participate in its vast economic potential. Design/methodology/approach-The study is based on the building of a model that depicts the evolution of business ethics in China as a base for further research. Findings-With the rapid development of the Chinese economy, opportunities are opening up to Chinese entrepreneurs and connected officials. This has led to money worship and, in some cases, thorough unethical behavior. The uncertain and ever-changing rules of the game generate opportunity for business ethics and CSR problems. This wealth creates temptation and incentives to cut corners to get rich fast. Much research has tried to explain business ethics in China through the understanding of Guanxi (Chinese social network of reciprocal business relations common in Confucian cultures), but in my view, the evolutionary aspect of it is missing to explain the present and future situation. Whereas considerable research has dealt with the growth of Chinese industries in recent years, the key relationship between changes in its economy and shifts in Chinese business ethics has been neglected.

So far, there have been comparatively few research studies on participation within sustainability implementation at university level, and a more differentiated understanding of these processes is still missing, both in the practice of conducting a participatory process and in the sustainability assessment. This paper addresses some of the failures and successes experienced within participatory approaches in campus sustainability initiatives, and deduces a set of critical success factors and emergent clusters that can help to integrate the dimensions of participation more inclusively into sustainability assessment. Following a qualitative approach and inspired by the Delphi-method, semi-structured expert interviews (N = 15) and four focus group discussions (N = 36), with participants coming from twenty different countries in total, were conducted and compared according to qualitative content analysis. Findings give empirical evidence to some of the characteristics related to stakeholder engagement, and associate higher education for sustainable development to empowerment and capacity building, shifting away from a previous focus on environmental sustainability. The success of participatory approaches is interdependent with structural institutional conditions and the persons engaged, highlighting the importance of specific skills and participatory competencies. A better integration of the dimensions of participation into sustainability assessment practices can help in defining and establishing participatory approaches on institutional level and fostering a culture of participation in the transition to sustainable universities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – An annual fair held in Sohna, a small town of Haryana, part of the District Gurgaon that has shown an exponential decadal urban growth rate, has been taken as a case to reflect on the context of small towns in India. Findings – Due to out-migration and weakening of local indigenous population and change in occupation patterns, there is threat to continuity of the fairs and festivals. The processes revolving around the urban fairs and festivals are driven though participation of various local stakeholders and mechanisms; hence, any attempts at strengthening or sustaining these need to stem from understanding of the various participants and their roles. Practical implications – An understanding of the possibilities and issues in organising the fairs and festivals through stakeholder engagement can help develop solutions to sustain these, enabling cultural continuity and positive economic impact on the various stakeholders. Originality/value – This paper creates a discussion on sustaining the little known cultural wealth of small and medium towns in Haryana among all local and external stakeholders with focus on fairs and festivals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cultural and economic sustainability; Cultural tourism; Participatory approach; Rapid urbanization; Small and medium towns; Stakeholder engagement; Tourism potential",

This study explores how linking these seemingly disparate pillars of sustainability may be facilitated through a TBL construct. The notion of sustainable business practices has been evolving and is increasingly understood to encompass considerations of economic viability, as well as environmental sustainability and social responsibility. Design/methodology/approach – The research is quantitative in nature, exploring and analysing how companies in different Norwegian industries implement and manage sustainable business practices based on TBL. The survey results are reported here. Findings – The relevance of TBL to different aspects of sustainable business practices is outlined. The study generally supports the view that a heightened propensity for sustainable business practices ensures that organisations are better equipped for meeting the challenge of integrating TBL in companies and their business networks. Research limitations/implications – The study tested a construct of TBL in the context of sustainable business practices. It may be incorporated in further research in relation to other constructs. Suggestions for further research are proposed. Practical implications – Useful for practitioners to get insights into TBL-reasons for implementing business-sustainable practices in companies and their business networks. It may also be valuable to assess the general status of business-sustainable practices in a company and their business networks. Originality/value – Linking two traditionally separate and encapsulated areas of research, namely, the area of business sustainable practices and the area of TBL.

As developed economies strive towards greater progress, sustainable business models are of the essence in order to maintain a balance between the triple bottom line: people, planet and profit. In recent years, European Union countries have installed important capacities of renewable energy, especially wind and solar energy to achieve this purpose. The objective of this article is to make a comparative study between the current sustainable business models implemented in companies that are active in the wind and solar energy sector in Romania. Both sectors underwent tremendous changes in the last two years due to changing support schemes which have had a significant influence on the mechanism of the renewable energy market, as well as on its development. Using the classical Delphi method, based on questionnaires and interviews with experts in the fields of wind and solar energy, this paper offers an overview of the sustainable business models of wind and solar energy companies, both sectors opting for the alternative of selling electricity to trading companies as a main source of revenue until 2013 and as the main future trend until 2020. Furthermore, the participating wind energy companies noted a pessimistic outlook of future investments due to legal instability that made them to reduce their projects in comparison to PV investments, which are expected to continue. The subject of the article is of interest to scientific literature because sustainable business models in wind and photovoltaic energy have been scarcely researched in previous articles and are essential in understanding the activity of the companies in these two fields of renewable energy. © 2015, Editura Economica.

Technically, quantitative content analysis can be applied through human as well as software coding. Examples for both applications are provided and discussed. We make reference to the software solutions 'Leximancer', 'Crawdad', and 'Wordle', and examine their suitability and limitations with regard to ethical questions for researching business ethics. We recommend a mixed-method approach, combining human and software coding.

The findings revealed sex differences in the ethical attitudes of enterprise students, but not of nascent entrepreneurs. In addition, the business ethics of male nascent entrepreneurs were significantly higher than those of male enterprise students.

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative self-administered survey was conducted with a convenience sample of Vietnamese working adults obtained through educational institutions, businesses and entrepreneurs and private and public sector organizations. This study used Clark and Clark’s (1966) Personal Business Ethics Scores measure. The Vietnamese version questionnaire was distributed, and a total of 704 surveys were fully completed and analyzed. Findings – Statistically significant differences were found in the variables of age, gender and government work experience. Management experience did not lead to any significant differences. Consequently, Kohlberg’s moral development theory regarding ethical development is partially supported. Research limitations/implications – This study used a convenience sample population. Future studies can compare specific populations in different parts of the country with similar working backgrounds and demographic variables. The small sample size is not necessarily representative of an entire country or the culture in Vietnam. Furthermore, it would be meaningful to investigate the relationship between ethical development and the demographic variables among other Asian countries near Vietnam. Finally, longitudinal studies can be implemented by future researchers to investigate the effects of changes in demographic variables on moral development. Practical implications – Females should be studied more to determine the factors that they consider when making decisions that impact others. Having longer time “socializing” with organizational values might be a stronger influence on ethical behaviors of a person. Vietnamese people are less tolerant for unethical behaviors when they are much younger and when they are much older. Social implications – The importance of ethics education programs at the national and organizational levels is underscored as a key element to combat corruption. Several specific recommendations on how to enhance the fight against corruption and bribery were provided. Originality/value – This study contributes to the moral development theory research and sheds light on the impact of age, gender, government work experience and management experience gained through the development process on ethical decision-making of Vietnamese people.

Findings - Key findings from this research highlighted deficiencies in the effectiveness of the accounting profession in assisting SMEs in implementing SBPs despite a desire from clients for accountants to provide this advice and a belief that accountants are best placed to do so. Further, an expectations gap is evident between the level of involvement accountants believe they should be having in assisting SMEs and the level of involvement that is currently occurring. Research limitations/implications - This finding has implications for the accounting profession, with accountants needing to examine their current business approaches in an effort to close this gap. If this does not occur, SMEs will most likely seek this much-needed advice and support from outside the profession.

This paper explores the potential contribution of focus groups, reviews their contribution to date and makes some recommendations regarding their future use. We find that, while the use of focus groups is not extensive, they have been utilised in a non-negligible number of studies. Focus groups are usually used as a supplementary method, often as part of the development of a research instrument. Whether used on their own or in conjunction with other methods, we find that in the majority of cases there is insufficient information for a reader to judge that the method has been carried out well and hence that the 'findings' may be trusted. Nor is it easy for future researchers to learn about the practical application of the method in business ethics contexts. We therefore recommend improved reporting in future published studies. Based on an analysis of a subsample of papers that provided a reasonable level of methodological detail, we provide further insights into, and recommendations for, the use of focus groups in business ethics research. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,

We then present a couple of approaches we have used to advance the understanding and teaching of business ethics and entrepreneurship as a set of foundational principles. As contextual framing for our analysis we convened eight colloquia/workshops over the past three years that bring a wide-ranging group of business school faculty, scholars in complementary disciplines, and business practitioners into a small-group setting to have in-depth conversations about the role of business ethics and entrepreneurship within the business school. Data used in our analysis catalog the ways and the degree to which AACSB-accredited business schools focus their undergraduate curricula and degree program structure on ethics and entrepreneurship. Working through publically available data, primarily from business school websites, we use content analysis as a framework for statistical analysis of the alignment between how a business school articulates strategic focus (mission, vision, and purpose statements) and how it structures its curricular offerings and degree programs. Most business schools continue to operationalize their approach to business ethics and entrepreneurship as programmatic appendages rather than a foundational set of knowledge and skills that are central to the schools teaching mission.

We provide a theoretical and empirical basis for the proposition that the bridge between CR and corporate irresponsibility is the embeddedness of strategic decisions in ethically oriented corporate practices toward sustainable value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis was performed by meta-theoretical and economic philosophical approaches. The contemporary trends which have led to the institutionalization of sustainability questions, are explained. Special attention is paid to the historical, cultural and the international institutional context within which organizational culture becomes saturated with deviance.

Relationship closeness is discussed with regard to brand communities, gifts, special possessions and brand love, and the often hidden ways that social discussed with reference to materialism. Materialism is sometimes misunderstood as an obsession with physical object, or as occurring when people care more about products than they do about people. In contrast, I argue that materialism is better understood as a style of relating to people. Originality/value - This paper integrates a range of disparate findings in support of a broadly applicable generalization that nothing matters more to people than other people.

Although interest in sustainable businesses is on the rise, these businesses are not yet widespread. Venture capital investment has a key role to play in the development of sustainable start-ups. The research area of 'sustainable' venture capital is still emerging. More research is required to understand how venture capital can support the development of sustainable businesses. This paper provides insight into how venture capitalists can contribute to sustainable business success, by investigating their role, motivations, investment theses, and barriers and enablers to success of sustainable ventures. The following question is investigated: How can sustainable venture capitalists contribute to the success of sustainable start-ups? Interviews were conducted with an expert sample of leading sustainable venture capitalists and other key stakeholders in sustainable entrepreneurship. It was found that next to financial support, venture capitalists provide triple bottom line business advice and network support. Key success factors include business model innovation, collaborations and a strong business case, whereas failure factors include a lack of suitable investors, a strong incumbent industry and a short-term investor mind-set. Sustainable start-ups should focus on triple bottom line business model innovation, find opportunity in new technology and funding platforms and develop multiple business cases to create success beyond the 'green customer base'. Sustainable venture capitalists can help prove the success of sustainable business formats, mitigate financial risk through co-investments and exercise patience by balancing financial with social and environmental returns. © 2015 The Author.

It reports on several governments' regulatory roles as their societal governance is intrinsically based on interdependent relationships. There are different actors and drivers who are shaping CSR communications and policies in relational frameworks. This paper mentions some of the countries that have already introduced intelligent substantive and reflexive regulations. It also shows how certain businesses are stepping in with their commitment for sustainability issues as they set their own policies and practices for laudable organisational behaviours. Very often, corporate businesses use non-governmental organisations' regulatory tools such as process and performance-oriented standards. These regulatory instruments focus on issues such as labour standards, human rights, health and safety, environmental protection, corporate governance and the like. Afterwards, this paper discusses about the relationship between governance and sustainability. It makes reference to some of the relevant European Union Expert Group recommendations for non-financial reporting and CSR audits. Relevant academic contributions are indicating that customers are expecting greater disclosures, accountability and transparency in sustainability reports.

Hence there is a risk of losing reputation if a company does not comply with environmental norms.

Thus, we consider the case of a German manufacturing company and present a mixed-integer linear programming supply chain design model with a demand function that is influenced by sustainability requirements.

It will also be necessary to cultivate 1,000,000,000 acres to meet the need for food. All this inevitably has an impact on metropolitan areas development: city becomes widespread and productive places diminish. City consumes but does not produces.

To address this, we propose a unified framework to properly incorporate the influence of social relationships into recommendation by the guidance of buddy (friends who have strong influence on user) and susceptibility (the willingness to be influenced) mining. Specifically, the Social Influence Propagation (SIP) method is proposed to identify each user's buddies and susceptibility and the Social Influence based Recommendation model is proposed to generate the final recommendation.

Design/methodology/approach – An online survey was conducted. Among the 978 respondents, a total of 548 respondents who used B&I foodservice equal to or more than five times a month on an average were included for analyses. Findings – The result revealed that consumers tended to perceive the concept of sustainability as “equivalent to (32 per cent) or beyond (28 per cent) being green or eco-friendly”. Consumers appeared to perceive the need for and the quality of sustainable B&I foodservice highly, but their awareness was comparatively low. Consumers’ awareness was significantly different across all demographic and food-related lifestyle variables. However, significant differences in the need and perceived quality were found only among food-related lifestyle variables.

The economic development leading to a globalised market brings forward additional arguments in supporting an enhanced quality of life. The abode where the optimum allocations of resources meet the society needs requires deeper understanding.

In this article, we argue that the social and the environmental practices (SEPs) associated with business sustainability not only contribute to short-term outcomes, but also to organizational resilience, which we define as the firm's ability to sense and correct maladaptive tendencies and cope positively with unexpected situations. Because organizational resilience is a latent, path-dependent construct, we assess it through the long-term outcomes, including improved financial volatility, sales growth, and survival rates. We tested these hypotheses with data from 121 U.S.-based matched-pairs (242 individual firms) over a 15-year period. We also tested, but did not find support for, the relationship between SEPs and short-term financial performance. Managerial summary: Most managers look for short-term financial benefits to justify socially responsible or sustainable practices. In this article, we argue that such practices also help firms become more resilient, which helps them avoid crises and bounce back from shocks. However, it is difficult to measure the avoidance of shocks, so we analyzed long-term outcomes. We show that firms that adopt responsible social and environmental practices, relative to a carefully matched control group, have lower financial volatility, higher sales growth, and higher chances of survival over a 15-year period; yet, we were unable to find any differences in short-term profits. We hope this research provides good reasons for firms to practice sustainability beyond the pursuit of short-term profits. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Business sustainability; Corporate social responsibility; Organizational resilience; Short-termism; Social and environmental practices","Finance; Managers; Profitability; Sales; Business sustainability; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Organizational resilience; Short-termism; Social and environmental; Sustainable development"

Thus, the possibility of irreconcilable tensions between 'sustainability' and 'economic development' has been identified, together with an apparent domination of the discourse on 'sustainable development' by corporations. In relation to this latter claim and mindful of Foucault's tenet that power also comes from below, we suggest that alternative 'voices' significant to the discourse should not be jettisoned because they are 'managerial' or 'corporate'. This argument focuses on the significance of 'voice' generated by managers taking strategic action with salient stakeholders. Given increasing strategic ambiguity, managers are leveraging broad stakeholder knowledge and input to achieve credible strategic outcomes that stakeholders can accommodate. We contend that the relationship between knowledge and power is significant in the discourse on sustainable development and that knowledge generated by stakeholder collaboration be recognized as an alternative 'voice'. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Collaboration; Dominant discourse; Grounded theory; Knowledge; Power relations; Stakeholders; Sustainable development","corporate strategy; knowledge; power relations; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development"

The aim of this study is to help companies better understand the issues around decarbonization and environmental performance by suggesting a holistic management process on which they could embark. This process comprises two crucial steps, which are (a) sustainability reporting and (b) low-carbon roadmaps. These steps are covered and further developed based on a detailed study of the UK food retail sector. This sector is relevant due to its economic and environmental importance, but most importantly it has a significant record of available environmental reports in the public domain and a large potential to influence consumers, policy makers and multiple supply chains. Sustainability reporting is assessed by analysing environmental KPIs disclosed in corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, and then these are compared against industry standards. This analysis highlights a general lack of consistency and transparency in CSR reporting of UK food retailers. Consequently, a low-carbon roadmap based on relevant KPIs and on the 'backcasting' framework is presented as a case study in order to showcase how a hypothetical UK food retailer can employ a low-carbon roadmap. The case study demonstrates that ambitious environmental targets are achievable if robust corporate action plans are followed. Furthermore, the case study indicates that capital might be misallocated in favour of highly visible environmental stores and on-site energy generation technologies, whilst more could be done by applying energy efficiency measures that have the potential to deliver substantial carbon savings. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental indicators; Roadmap; Stakeholder engagement; Supermarkets; Sustainable development",

To clarify what is meant by “pragmatism” as a philosophy for social and environmental accountability (SEA) research, to survey its use within this research field and to explore how a further pursuit of pragmatism may extend this research field. Design/methodology/approach – An extensive review of the SEA literature was conducted in order to determine what aspects of the philosophy of pragmatism have been used within the research. The authors organised the discussion of the literature around the pragmatist ideas of “truth” and “sensemaking”. Findings – SEA research is a heterogeneous space in which various ideas are commonly attributed to the philosophical notion of pragmatism. However, there is a tension in the literature between seeing accounting as a medium for representing social and environmental organisational activities and a pragmatist view of accountings as a way of allowing managers and stakeholder to make sense of these same activities. Research limitations/implications – A clearer development of the ideas of pragmatism may be used to redirect the focus of SEA research in a number of useful ways. Seeing accounting as a medium of sensemaking between organisations and their stakeholders allows the authors to widen the exploration of accounting not only to the production of reports but also their interpretation by users. The ideas of pragmatism also allow the authors to explore the ways stakeholders might affect change within organisations and how accounting may support this process rather than capture or limit it. Practical implications – This paper concludes by providing a set of methodological prescriptions for conducting future SEA research in a way that is inspired by pragmatism. It outlines an approach to research that focuses on users and their sensemaking and encourages an exploration of the possible ways accounting may create positive change in organisations. Originality/value – Overall, this paper refines what it means to follow pragmatism within SEA research. It will promote a clearer understanding of how we, as a research community, may engage with practice in more positive ways in order to facilitate corporate social responsibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Pragmatism; Social and environmental reporting; Stakeholder engagement",

The problem of how to engage local culture in this process, however, has received comparatively little attention, despite the recognition of stakeholders and the importance of their involvement. This research examines how collaboration between stakeholders might be established to conserve and thus help regenerate the historic and largely abandoned port town of Suakin. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives of Suakins stakeholder groups and supported through archival analysis and observational studies. The intention was to explore the stakeholders views of the conservation drivers, conservation practice, and conservation challenges and enablers affecting Suakin. The stakeholders response provides a preliminary status to the various perspectives concerning the conservation of Suakins built heritage. The findings identify a number of major issues impacting Suakins conservation and reveal a potential for implementing a comprehensive and inclusive conservation approach. The research establishes the case for further research to determine best methods to enable stakeholders to collaboratively address the issues impacting Suakins conservation.

The scope of value sensitive design can be extended beyond the technology, however. Values are also embedded in the institutional context and in the processes of interaction between stakeholders. Hence, the prevention of controversies over conflicting values may be pursued by redesigning the institutional context, and by taking the dynamics of stakeholder interaction explicitly into account. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Energy projects; Institutional design; Stakeholder engagement; Value sensitive design; Values",

This paper responds to these knowledge gaps through a case study of curriculum renewal that involved embedding sustainability into a first year engineering curriculum. The initiative was guided by a deliberative and dynamic model for curriculum renewal that brought together internal and external stakeholders through a structured sequence of facilitated workshops and meetings. That process identified sustainability-related knowledge and skills relevant for first year engineering, and faculty members teaching in the first year program were guided through a process of curriculum renewal to meet those needs. The process through which the whole of curriculum renewal was undertaken is innovative and provides a case study of precedent in the field of education for sustainability. The study demonstrates the contribution that can be made by a web-based sustainability portal in supporting curriculum renewal. Learning and teaching outcomes were evaluated through 'before and after surveys' of the first year engineering students. Statistically significant increases in student's self-reported knowledge of sustainability were measured as a result of exposure to the renewed first year curriculum and this confirmed the value of the initiative in terms of enhancing student learning. While applied in this case to engineering, the process to achieve integration of sustainability into the curriculum approach is likely to have value for other academic disciplines. Considering student performance on assignments and exam questions relating to sustainability would provide a stronger basis for future research to understand the impact of initiatives like this on student learning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Monitoring spatial plans increases knowledge of whether they achieved their goals in guaranteeing sustainable development on a territorial level. Indicators are suited for this task and could play an important role in determining the applicability or effectiveness of plans. The contribution of indicator sets for effective strategic sustainability monitoring needs to be supported by an analysis of consistency and meaning at each stage of indicator development, from design to implementation. Indicator selection is usually done by experts and/or through participatory approaches and often little is known about the robustness of the selection stage, its utility, accuracy, validity, feasibility and redundancy. The main goal of this research is to identify, through a participatory approach and data reduction techniques, a set of sustainability indicators for strategic monitoring of regional spatial plans. Decision makers and planning practitioners from regional and local authorities, as well as academics, were asked to assess through a scoring procedure the importance of a base set of sustainability indicators to monitor the effects of a spatial plan. Principal Components Analysis, followed by sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulation were used in the data reduction phase. This approach was tested on a set of outcomes/effects indicators developed for the Algarve's regional spatial plan (southern Portugal). It was possible to highlight the importance of involving different groups of stakeholders and to identify relevant indicator selection criteria, as well as a final set of indicators that are more representative of different stakeholders' opinions and more able to translate, in an integrated way, overall changes in sustainability performance. Factors that can influence the results of the approach are discussed, such as stakeholder representativeness and data availability. Recommendations regarding the use of the approach and its results are also presented, for example concerning the use of information conveyed by indicators in an aggregated way, in the form of an index. The approach could be useful to guide the collection of regional sustainability data, contributing to the reporting and assessment of spatial plans, tailored to each particular territorial reality and stakeholders' perceptions, values, needs and concerns. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This chapter provides an introduction to the landscape of responsible innovation, drawing from the contributions to this volume and an emerging body of literature. First, the concept of responsible innovation is explored: What does ‘responsible innovation’ refer to? The concept can be seen as an ideal, of incorporating social and ethical values or aspects in the innovation process, and as a project, a joint enterprise of an increasingly large community of people who want to bring us closer to this ideal. Next, approaches to responsible innovation are discussed: How can we go about innovating responsibly? While all approaches seem to have in common a key role for stakeholder engagement, one can distinguish two broad types of approaches to make innovation in a certain context more responsible. There is a product approach, characterised by a focus on developing some kind of output-a method, a framework, or guidelines; and a process approach, focused on developing some kind of procedure, usually with an element of self-learning. Subsequently, the current landscape of responsible innovation is briefly sketched: Who is doing what in which areas? The chapter ends with explaining the structure of this edited volume and a brief tour through the chapters, which together provide a rich body of work that anticipates, reflects, deliberates, and responds to the challenges of responsible innovation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Definition; Process approach; Product approach; Reflexive learning; Responsible innovation; Responsible research and innovation (RRI); Stakeholder engagement",

The differences between companies' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of the companies operating in the three countries with highest number of firms committed to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) -Spain, France and Japan- is assessed through a multidimensional HJ-Biplot technique, which is a statistical technique that provides a joint graphical representation in a low dimensional Euclidean space (usually a plane), of a multivariate data matrix. This research contributes to the existing literature providing quantitative evidence of how different country-specific social and institutional schemes influence companies' ESG performance. The main results reveal the existence of two clusters of companies behaving in different ways with regard of sustainability issues. First, Spanish and French companies exhibit similar levels of social and corporate governance performance, higher than those of Japanese firms. Second, Japanese firms seem more committed to environmental issues than Spanish and French companies. These results confirm that the different countries, with different institutional backgrounds, induce different priorities among their firms, in terms of ESG performance, even under a common commitment to the same principles of adopted CSR initiative. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate environmental; Corporate social responsibility; Institutionalism; Social and governance performance; Stakeholder engagement; United Nations Global Compact","Economic and social effects; Societies and institutions; Corporate environmental; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Institutionalism; Social and governance performance; Stakeholder engagement; United Nations; Sustainable development"

Contrary to parts of the extant literature, we do not find that corporate sustainability directly adds measurable value (e.g. a better brand image); neither does it exert coercive control over critical supplier relationships. However, corporate sustainability minimizes the downside risk of the business model. It does so by (1) creating implicit contracts that reach beyond traditional 'shareholder value', (2) transferring risk to suppliers and (3) improving leadership by motivating management and employees, and by directing their attention to critical issues. For companies, we offer the insight that corporate sustainability is a necessary complement to shareholder value, even if the relationship is not obvious at first sight. We also suggest that concerted actions of companies or a positive connotation of certification create effective control over suppliers. As to public policy, we conclude that regulators could introduce mandatory disclosure of suppliers to facilitate controls through stakeholders, or alternatively an industry-wide comply-or-explain code of conduct. We also address how regulators can take direct actions against countries with unsustainable labor policies. Last, we suggest future research topics, e.g. expanding the notion of a business model by interpreting 'adding value' as prevention of losses. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Business model; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability; CSR policies; Environmental policy; Information disclosure; Labor practices; Public policy; Risk management; Shareholder value; Stakeholder engagement; Supply chain; Sustainable development",

This is done in a context where prior studies in the literature do not relate these concepts to each other or place the concepts within a meaningful context, nor integrate them into a single framework. The framework demonstrates an organisational journey towards achieving legitimacy in environmental endeavours. Environmental legitimacy is conditional upon the public evaluation of corporate environmental performance and environmental reporting (environmental accountability), which in turn, requires organisations to invest in environmental management and accounting systems and stakeholder engagement (environmental proactivity). The paper identifies company, stakeholder and other characteristics that influence the constructs in the framework and also propose a research agenda based on this framework. Environmental performance constitutes the central concept in the framework, acknowledging that improved environmental performance promotes the ultimate goal of sustainability. The framework suggests that the judicious management of environmental performance and reporting, the two components of environmental accountability, results in environmental legitimacy. Furthermore, environmental accountability can be enhanced by environmental proactivity, a concept comprising environmental management and environmental accounting, as well as stakeholder engagement.

Greed represents extreme self-interest whereas altruism reflects concern for others. We argue that managerial greed leads to a focus on short-term decisions and short-term firm performance. Alternatively, managerial altruism normally produces a focus on longer term decisions and long-term firm performance. Managerial greed is also more likely to produce wrongdoing, whereas managerial altruism produces greater corporate citizenship behaviors. Managerial greed is likely to lead to turnover for non-performance–related reasons whereas managerial altruism is more likely to produce managerial turnover for performance reasons. Overall, we conclude that measured self-interest keeps managers focused on the firm’s goals and measured altruism helps the firm to build and maintain strong human and social capital. The extremes of either greed or altruism likely will harm firm performance. Thus, balance between managerial self-interest and managerial altruism leads to the greatest success. © 2015, © The Authors 2015.","agency; CEO altruism; CEO greed; self-interest",

In a search for diversification, tourism and film may be targeted by these regions. Challenges of regional planning, however, include lack of local expertise, decentralized decision making, and diverse stakeholder groups. Specifically for film tourism this includes anticipating visitation numbers and assessing potential negative impacts. Broken Hill, located in Outback Australia, was used to investigate the complementary integration of film into regional development and tourism strategies. A stakeholder engagement process that adopted a transactive approach was implemented. The main findings of this process highlighted the need to develop the strong film presence into a visitor-friendly product, coordinating the film product with other destination strengths, establishing an expert and sector-diverse governance team, and developing a consistent brand with film as a component. Implications for other regional areas include considering how a film presence can be harnessed to develop film tourism experience opportunities, utilizing film tourism and production expertise to develop a coordinated and sustainable product, and to promote film experiences reflective of their place in the destination hierarchy.

On the basis of some main critical aspects, which are common to various socio-technological systems, this approach identifies criteria for a generalised governance assessment methodology for evaluating the possibility of systems for more sustainable futures. Underpinning these criteria is a multidisciplinary approach, a ‘Governance Assessment Matrix Exercise’ (GAME), which provides a toolkit for setting general criteria for sustainability for each of the dimensions of the five capitals model and choosing between alternative futures through a participatory process of stakeholder engagement. The central theme of the article is that the choice between alternative futures should be participatory in nature and the success of this process can be aided by an acceptance of a commonly derived set of sustainability criteria supported by a governance structure.

In spite of the slowly emerging trend of SR in higher education, it is still unclear for certain actors within this field what SR entails. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the existing literature on SR in higher education, aimed at providing guidance on the topic, uncovering gaps and inconsistencies in the literature, and finding new paths for research. The findings show that the topic of SR has been approached in a rather fragmented way in the literature, while the scientific field would benefit from more in-depth studies, preferably supplemented by empirical evidence. Important issues for future research are: the potential of SR for organisational change, the influence of stakeholder engagement processes on SR, the link between SR and general sustainability management, and the link between existing reporting indicators, tools, and management standards. Structuring and defining these topics can stimulate scholars to further study them in depth, leading to a better understanding of the dynamics of the reporting process, and in a broader sense of the process of sustainability integration in higher education. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While there are many MNCs in Vietnam that warrant analysis regarding their CSR efforts, American coffee giant Starbucks is an instructive starting point as it is generally renowned for its strategic CSR efforts in the United States and other developed markets. The authors believe there is a need to examine whether there is a spillover effect in Vietnam, due to Starbucks' recent establishment in the country, to further CSR and PR research. Using content analysis, the authors investigated content relating to Starbucks Vietnam's CSR efforts on Starbuck's Facebook page and website, and in the mainstream media in Vietnam.The authors found a remarkable lack of strategy and sophistication regarding Starbucks Vietnam's CSR efforts and the communication of these efforts, resulting in unfocused, ad hoc and short-term CSR activities with limited stakeholder engagement, including with media stakeholders. The authors' paper recommends clear identification of beneficiaries of CSR, and more strategic, sophisticated and long-term activities promoted with more engaging communication that would enable MNCs such as Starbucks to expand CSR in Vietnam and steer the country's emerging PR industry in a socially responsible direction. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Multinationals; Public relations; Vietnam",

It has been assumed that all industries understand and apply the social licence to operate concept in a similar way, as previous research has tended to adopt a single-industry focus. This article is one of the first known cross-industry examinations of social licence to operate, comparing the use of this concept in four Australian energy industry contexts: mining, wind, carbon dioxide capture and storage, and geothermal. Semi-structured interviews with industry representatives were conducted to provide a comparison of views on the understanding and application of social licence to operate in these industries. The findings identified shared expectations of increasing stakeholder engagement in energy project development, and a view that a social licence to operate could guide this engagement. Yet the duration of use, the maturity of the industry, and the ways in which the industries related to the concept influenced the understanding and application of this concept. This research provides evidence of how the meaning and application of social licence to operate does vary between industries. Further exploration of community and government perspectives on social licence to operate is recommended in order to broaden the findings of this research. Such research will provide an emerging platform for encouraging discerning use of the concept by industries, and also practitioners who may be engaged across multiple industries. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It explores the role of regulation and procurement consortia in sustainable procurement. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a case study of the UK social housing sector and uses an online survey (n = 116) of UK Housing Associations. Factor analysis identifies three parsimonious dimensions of sustainable procurement. Attitudinal data are analysed to explore the field-level adoption of sustainable procurement and the role of consortia. Findings - The results delineate sustainable procurement activities into three factors; direction setting, supplier-centric assurance and local socially oriented supply. High yet sup-optimal levels of sustainable procurement activity are revealed. Prevailing attitudes identify positive commitments to sustainable procurement at individual, organisational and sector levels. The value of network collaboration is identified. Tenants as critical stakeholders do not prioritise sustainable procurement creating challenge for inclusivity. Regulators are seen to a have low level of sustainable procurement knowledge and procurement consortia a high perceived knowledge. Research limitations/implications - Results provide insight into the effect of sustainable procurement policy, the role of regulators and network structures and consortia, raising issues around legitimacy, coopetition, stakeholder engagement, performance measurement, and functional/sectoral maturity. Social implications - The identification of the potential exclusion of tenants in sustainability debates is particularly significant to deliver social value.

However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies - descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics - for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies' delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research. Finally, the limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are presented. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Application Programming Interface (API); Big data; Content analytics; Data analytics; Network analytics; Social media analytics; Supply chain management; Twitter","Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Chains; Computer systems programming; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Information management; Manufacture; Natural language processing systems; Research and development management; Risk management; Social networking (online); Content analytics; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Data analytics; Environmental standards; Social media analytics; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain risk management; Twitter; Supply chain management"

In order to infer the current level of environmental performance and the progress being made it is imperative that universities measure and report their campus greening efforts. This paper shows that sustainability reporting can be a simple task and is of significant value for directing sustainable campus operations. To do this, Environmentally Extended Input Output Analysis was used to derive the carbon footprint for the University of Leeds. Being driven by financial data which is readily available to universities the assessment is easy to conduct and maintain through time. Environmentally Extended Input Output Analysis provides complete coverage of the campus system and thus accounts for the majority of emissions sources. Accordingly, it enables comparisons of environmental performance to be made between institutions. The reliability of comparisons falters when organisational boundaries vary between carbon footprints, and thus, in the interest of methodological consistency, a framework should be established that defines universal organisational boundaries which universities must adhere to. Interviews with university procurement staff showed that carbon footprints can provide a screening assessment which identifies emissions hotspots in supply chains. Such as assessment is currently lacking and provides evidence of win win situations where emissions and costs can be reduced simultaneously. Although carbon footprinting considers only the environmental dimension of the triple bottom line, it is recommended that universities intensify its application. For the institutions themselves the results will be of significant practical value for directing initiatives such as sustainable procurement and for enhancing stakeholder engagement with the sustainability agenda, whilst an increased application will help build much needed momentum for sustainability reporting overall. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Campus greening; Carbon footprinting; Environmentally extended input output analysis; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable procurement","Carbon footprint; Decision making; Education; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Campus greening; Carbon footprinting; Input output analysis; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable procurement; Sustainable development"

Design/methodology/approach – First, a theoretical framework is provided to help in the characterisation of reputational risks and how they impact supply chain members that may be multiple tiers away from the manufacturer. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners who were familiar with reputational risks and who were engaging in varying mitigating techniques. Cognitive modelling was utilised to report the findings. Findings – The practitioners in this paper were very familiar with the risks and were active in varying mitigating practices as budgets and resource constraints would allow. The brevity of the risks identified and the significance of specific risks with how they impact a reputation was revealed. Mitigation is an ongoing and haphazard process with very little information available as would be expected with a typical risk management approach. Research limitations/implications – This paper serves to provide practitioners insight into the varying methods used by firms with supply chain members that number in hundreds. Based on our findings, a recommendation was made that utilise corporate social responsibility as a foundation that is proposed to address a number of risks including those related to price, availability and quality. The limits of this work are that it is specific to a select group of practitioners specialised in this area. Although the information is rich, it is not generalisable.

Specifically, we argue that the profession should embrace the development of standards for reporting information important to a broader group of stakeholders than just investors and creditors. The FASB has recently moved in the opposite direction. Nonetheless, an institution around accounting for stakeholders continues to grow, backed by a groundswell of support from many sources. Based on institutional theory, we predict that this institution and the forces supporting it will cause changes in the public accounting profession, even if through coercion. We also provide examples of stakeholder accounting, building from the premise that a primary responsibility of accounting is to provide information to address the risk management needs of stakeholders. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.","Accounting principles; Corporate responsibility; FASB; Stakeholder accounting; Stakeholder theory",

This often calls for the creation, use and exploitation of new knowledge. Therefore, knowledge resources must be properly managed to enable wellinformed decisions. There is, however, little empirical research on the key drivers for managing sustainability-related knowledge in the UK industrial sectors - which is the core aspect of this paper. For this study, four industry sectors: energy and utilities, transportation, construction and not-for-profit organisations were considered, based on the environmental, social and economic impact on UK society. A semi-structured interview method was used to collect industry perception, which was then analysed at both aggregate and sector levels using content analysis for inference and conclusion. The data analysis revealed four key drivers that have fuelled the need for managing sustainabilityrelated knowledge. They are: to improve access to knowledge associated with sustainability initiatives, to identify knowledge assets associated with sustainability initiatives, to improve the flow of knowledge associated with sustainability initiatives and to capture key knowledge associated with sustainability initiatives. The paper concludes that identifying and understanding the key drivers for managing knowledge within the context of sustainability is a complex process. Before embarking on a knowledge management journey, decision makers have to understand what they would like to achieve with their knowledge management programme and what value it needs to add to their organisation in the context of sustainability.","Corporate responsibility; Knowledge management; Sustainability","Decision making; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Complex Processes; Corporate responsibility; Empirical research; Industrial sector; Industry Perceptions; Knowledge resource; Semi structured interviews; Social and economic impacts; Sustainable development"

For the empirical investigation, we use quantitative survey data collected from 60 of the world's leading forestry companies. This study's empirical results indicate that incentives for adopting forest certification are more often external rather than internal, and more market driven than regulation driven, which would suggest the dominance of extrinsic motivation.

Drawing from resource dependency theory (RDT) and related theories of social networks and the resource-based view of the firm, the authors develop a series of hypotheses that draw from this conceptual foundation to predict a range of factors that influence firms to collaborate with NGOs. These factors include the level of commitment of the firm to CSR, the strategic fit between the firm’s and the NGO’s resources, the level of trust the firm has in NGOs, the frequency of contact with NGOs, prior level and perception of experience with NGOs, and the level of pressure exerted by NGOs. The authors report on results of a survey of the Top 500 firms in the Netherlands on their interactions with NGOs, finding general support for our hypotheses, and suggest that understanding the motives for firm–NGO interactions can teach us more about firms’ corporate social activities and the way such activities are shaped in the dynamic interplay between firms and their stakeholders.

Design/methodology/approach-The paper consists of a literature review and two surveys. The literature review concentrates on exploring investors’ and tenants’ CR and sustainability drivers. Empirical evidence was gathered via two specific surveys. The first survey targeted investors, and the second survey targeted tenants to determine the focus areas of sustainability. Findings-The findings of this study indicate that the vicious circle of blame can be turned into one of cooperation with respect to sustainable buildings if the mutual drivers for improving sustainability are linked with investor–tenant collaboration. Based on the survey, the tenants claim that productivity, corporate culture and image are the primary drivers for sustainable buildings, whereas the investors claim that corporate culture and image, tenant demand and marketability are the primary drivers. Both parties mentioned the same sustainability drivers: corporate culture and image and lower operating costs. However, it was found that investors are not communicating their CR actions to public or promoting image and productivity benefits of green buildings to potential tenants.

What heretofore has been essentially regarded as an issue to be tackled by governmental institutions, and therefore not perceived as an important component of the value that is created for the institutional and private owners of profit-driven companies, is explicitly treated here as a corporate responsibility. Bridging knowledge domains, I review major research works conducted by management, corporate sustainability, and (welfare) economics scholars and focusing on water management issues to unveil the conditions under which corporations are likely to manage, or to be challenged in managing, water in responsible/sustainable ways. Three types of “tensions” that confront academics and managers alike are discussed: voluntary actions versus coercion, free riding versus cooperation, and economic versus corporate water responsibility motives. I propose a three-dimensional framework of corporate water responsibility for thinking through the managerial response patterns contemplated to address these tensions. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.","business sustainability; corporate water responsibility; integrative literature review; water resources management","conceptual framework; corporate strategy; literature review; sustainability; water management"

This chapter focuses on the uses of social media for marketing communications, in particular for public relations and corporate social responsibility (CSR) by Pfizer's European offices. In doing so it evaluates the relationship between public relations and CSR as well as reviews some of the uses of social media for healthcare communications and CSR. Methodology/approach - Using a deductive approach and a methodology that combines qualitative content analysis aimed at identifying communication themes and social media audits on brand integration and communication coherence, this chapter aims to identify how Pfizer's European offices use social media to communicate online. To establish the corporate line and branding general guidelines for Pfizer, we have recorded from the company's official website (www. pfizer.com) its corporate overview and corporate responsibility information, embedded into the 'About us' section of the website. From the home page, social media links were then sought. To ensure all links were recorded the researchers used two gateways, one using the social media links on the website and one through each country's website and their social media links on their home page. The Pfizer official accounts were excluded from this analysis, the interest being on the country uses of social media and not Pfizer's official general channels. General traffic and engagement data automatically reported by each social media platforms such as number of tweets, followers, fans, and number of views were recorded manually. For more insight into Twitter activity FollerMe was then used to capture and record each account's most recent activity as it enabled the discovery of each account's creation date and the most frequently used words and hashtags in its tweets. It also helped assess the levels of performance of each country on Twitter by looking at the reported ratios of replies, mentions, tweets with links, hashtags or media to the last 100 tweets sent from the each account. For Facebook and YouTube data, only the publicly reported data was recorded. The text in the Twitter bios and about sections was also recorded and compared with the company's corporate and CSR descriptions included on the main website. Findings - Out of the 20 countries that do have a Pfizer country office, only 10 of them have a social media presence. Turkey and Spain have four social media channels each and Belgium has three. All the other countries are present on only one social media platform. They show an overall integration and coordination of messages with themes mirrored from one platform to another. The channels also show an overall compliance and consistency with the brand, most of them displaying bespoke backgrounds, bios and links to the country website. When it comes to social media integration, the accounts are poorly integrated and interlinked. Moreover, although social media provides a platform for dialogue, two out of the three platforms analysed have very little user interaction. This high concern for message control can be indicative of a variety of elements: a lack of certainty/security in handling social media, a risk-averse attitude towards social media, a lack of training of staff about how to handle social media or perhaps a lack of resources. The platforms used have all different functions and address different target audiences. YouTube proves to excel as a public information/CSR medium for the general public, the most popular content fitting into those categories. Twitter is a corporate communications environment by excellence, a true mouth-piece of the organization. Finally, Facebook is Pfizer's user engagement environment but within Pfizer's own comfort and rules, the presence of a policy document making the boundaries of communication very clear. Research limitations/implications - Although looking only at one company and its social media communication practices and although it uses only publicly reported data, this chapter raises a variety of questions about the use of social media by big, multinational corporations, the resources they allocate and the amount to which they perceive these channels as anything more than just another company mouth-piece. It also raises questions about how companies choose to portray themselves on social media in comparison to joining conversations, commenting on current trends and celebrating their partners and employees. Perhaps future research could explore these aspects in more depth. Practical implications and originality/value - Pfizer who declares itself the 'world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company' is currently among the most influential companies in the world, occupying currently the 148th position in the Global Fortune 500 list. Due to its position within the industry, Pfizer has been the subject of previous research materials including marketing and health communications; however, no study yet has analysed Pfizer's uses of social media. By analysing the social media communications of Pfizer in Europe and by pointing to the inconsistencies between country accounts, this chapter raises further questions about social media strategy and its implementation by corporations. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,

Financing civil wars with stolen diamonds seems strange. But it did happen in Angola and Sierra Leone a while ago. At that time the world diamond business was still being controlled by just one producer plus trader. In retrospect not so surprisingly, De Beers allowed itself being talked into providing active support to the two governments fighting the respective rebellious groups and to a number of other governments appalled at reports of atrocities occurring on both sides but proving reluctant to commit their own soldiers. As a result business, i.e. De Beers, along with governments, mainly of consumer States, started operating a worldwide certification scheme effectively distinguishing between stolen blood diamonds and their legally marketed clones. The bottom line was that the rebels' financial resources were gradually being dried out while De Beers managed to secure its near monopoly for another decade or so. On other occasions, it may not be that simple to identify equally effective incentives when business is being asked not only to abide by solemn rules of corporate responsibility but to actively promote human rights and good governance. But given the mixed prospects of judicial enforcement, Kimberley should be kept in mind. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,

This chapter argues that such activities illustrate a particular notion of Baumol’s (1990) criminal entrepreneurialism where both creative and constructive compliance combine to subvert environmental regulation and its enforcement. Design/methodology/approach — This chapter employs a case study approach assessing the current corporate environmental responsibility landscape against the reality of corporate environmental offending. Its case study shows seemingly repeated environmental offending by Shell Oil against a backdrop of the company claiming to have integrated environmental monitoring and scrutiny into its operating procedures. Findings — The chapter concludes that corporate assertion of environmental credentials is itself often a form of criminal entrepreneurship where corporations embrace voluntary codes of practice and selfregulation while internally promoting the drive for success and profitability and/or avoidance of the costs of true environmental compliance deemed too high. As a result, this chapter argues that responsibility for environmental damage requires regulation to ensure corporate responsibility for environmental damage. Originality/value — The chapter employs a green criminological perspective to its analysis of corporate social responsibility and entrepreneurship. Thus, it considers not only just strict legal definitions of crime and criminal behaviour but also the overlap between the legal and the illegal and the preference of governments to use administrative or civil penalties as tools to deal with corporate environmental offending. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CSR/CER; Environmental crime; Ethical standards; Polluter pays; Pollution; Social justice",

Whilst striving to start an equity fund for developing countries, he discovered that there is a stigma attached to the term ‘developing countries’ and is synonymous with lack of progress. Consequently he could not attract funding. To overcome this problem, he coined the term ‘emerging market’ so that they would be associated with ‘progress, uplift and dynamism’ (Economist, Sept, 2008). In current times, the developed markets’ growth rate has slowed down considerably. So companies are looking at emerging economies in order to improve their sales and consequently their growth rates. Further, emerging economy countries have about 75% of the world’s population. These countries have a better growth in income as also consumer purchasing power. They have low-cost, large untapped high-quality sources. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in international business. Consequently, many entrepreneurial and business enterprises have started operations in these emerging economies. The authors wish to study whether these businesses pay attention to conserving natural resources through green business endeavours. Today, uncontrolled business activities have considerably harmed our ecological system leading to global warming and depletion of natural resources. The world has now slowly woken up to the need for following green practices both in day to day activities as also businesses. India, as one of the BRIC nations, also is seeing a lot of entrepreneurial and business activity. It is therefore imperative to note the amount of weightage given by business houses to green business measures that will be eco-friendly. For the present study, the methodology adopted was a survey of the kind of measures that corporates in Pune follow in order to get an idea of whether Indian businesses are aware of the need for having entrepreneurial eco-friendly systems for maintaining a more sustained environment. A structured questionnaire was administered to proprietors of small businesses in the major busy areas of Pune to find out whether restaurant owners and shopkeepers are aware of global warming and whether they are contributing toward a green environment. Both primary and secondary resources were used to determine whether businesses big or small are adopting green business endeavours. It was found that many of the well-known corporate houses have initiated green ventures. For e.g., Mahindra has started its green technology drive. Tata Motors has reduced its oil consumption through conservation, recycling and reuse of industrial oils. The company was the first to introduce radial tyres for enhancing fuel efficiency. New technology in the manufacturing process of companies such as the New IBF Factory, Tata Marcopolo Motors Limited and Eastern Complex facilities has improved productivity as well as quality which indirectly translates into less consumption of resources or less carbon footprint. A study of these companies along with some newspaper reports of polluted rivers and flooded gutters in Pune indicates that while some well-known companies have realised the importance of green business practices for both sustainable ecological environment and also a positive corporate image, many business houses still need to be educated and brought round to conforming to legal norms of enforcing environment-friendly practices and social corporate responsibility. Only then can India hope to encash on its present economic growth for long-term, sustainable development. © Springer India 2015.",,

It reviews the use of a whistleblower to highlight AML irregularities rather than official reporting through the current AML compliance system. The article uses secondary data to offer a viewpoint on the HSBC issues from a money laundering and financial crime perspective. It extracts key statements from staff at HSBC and regulators, and examines how AML risk assessment was undertaken at this time and what changes need to occur in the future. It considers the implications of the current theoretical context for AML from an agency theory perspective. The main findings are that AML compliance needs to be embedded into a proactive corporate social responsibility approach, rather than relying solely on regulation to improve detection and reporting of money laundering activity. The research topic is new and therefore analysis papers and other academic writing on this topic are limited. Future research could consider the outcomes of the Swiss bank's attempts to prosecute the whistleblower and whether this would have implications for future internal reporting and whistleblowing approaches to support AML compliance. The outcomes from the research are the recommendations to the banking sector on addressing AML deficiencies, especially within the context of an evolving level of criminal sophistication towards money laundering. The article supports the argument for integrating social corporate responsibility and AML compliance in order to produce a whole bank response to financial crime. This is in contrast to the current systems that seem to be prevalent within the financial services, of profit and business being seen as separate rather than integral to regulation and control. The value of this article is the current example of the HSBC Swiss case and the focus specifically on AML compliance rather than tax evasion, which has been the media angle on the issue. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1741-3591.",,

The second objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between the dimensions of CSR disclosures and corporate financial performance (CFP) among Nigerian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach - To carry out this research, content analysis was conducted to extract CSR and financial data from annual reports of 68 companies listed on the Nigeria Stock Exchange. Financial data were cross-referenced with the NSE Factbook. CSR indexes and financial performance measures were computed for estimation of the regression analysis equation. The percentages were used to describe the nature and trend of CSR practice in Nigeria. This was followed by the hierarchical multiple regression analysis to examine the relationship between CSR and CFP. Findings - The results of the descriptive statistics show that the listed companies used CSR initiatives to communicate social performance to their stakeholders. From the regression analysis, community involvement disclosure, products and customer disclosures and human resource disclosures were found to enhance CFP. The results also reveal a negative relationship between environmental disclosure and CFP, which indicates that disclosure of environmental impact information could be value destroying in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications - The major limitation of this paper is the sample size. Also, failure of corporations to disclose CSR in the annual reports will have a material effect on these findings. Practical implications - The findings of this paper have practical implications on the management of Nigerian companies to re-think and re-strategize their CSR policies that incorporate social and economic performance to improve their CFP. Social implications - This paper has implication on stakeholders in validating the corporate citizenship of corporations based on the level of commitment and participation in CSR initiatives. Also, findings of this paper will alert the enforcement agencies on the status of CSR practices in Nigeria. Government in collaboration with private and public agencies should consider the needs for CSR framework and database to guide social and environmental reporting in the country.

Both researchers and practitioners would therefore benefit from having a rigorous instrument to measure reputations and the ability to develop predictive modeling of reputation's impact on stakeholder outcomes. The RepTrak® System evolved from studies conducted by Reputation Institute since 2000 to provide a systematic tool for tracking and analyzing stakeholder perceptions that could help companies better manage their reputation and its effects on stakeholder behaviors. Prior research has demonstrated the validity of the RepTrak® Pulse as a short form measure of 'corporate reputation'. This study reports empirical tests developed to validate the seven dimensions that the RepTrak® System uses to predict corporate reputation and stakeholder support. Although these seven dimensions have been verified internally by Reputation Institute, this methodology and its validation have not been reported publicly, limiting researchers' and practitioners' abilities to use the seven dimensions in their respective efforts. To shed light on the model's structure, this paper reports tests conducted to validate the measures empirically across five stakeholder groups in six countries. Multivariate analyses confirm the existence and stability of the seven underlying dimensions in the factor structure, each of which is constructed from a set of 3-4 underlying attributes.

Design/methodology/approach - The author presents a sample consisting of data corresponding to 573 pension plans in relation to such aspects as financial performance, inception date, asset size, number of participants, custodial and management fees, and whether their managers adopt ethical screening or give part of their profits to social projects. On this data the author implements the fixed effects panel data model proposed by Vogelsang (2012). Findings - The results obtained indicate that investors/consumers prefer traditional or solidarity pension plans to ethical pension plans. Furthermore, the findings show that ethical investors/consumers are more (less) sensitive to positive (negative) lagged returns than caring and traditional consumers, causing traditional consumers to contribute to pension plans that they already own. Research limitations/implications - The author does not know what types of environmental, social and corporate governance criteria have been adopted by ethical pension plan managers and the weight given to each of these criteria for selecting the stock of the firms in their portfolios that could influence in the investors’ behaviour. Practical implications - The results obtained in the current paper show that investors invest less money in ethical pension plans than in traditional and solidarity pension plans; this could be due to the lack of information for their part. To solve this, management companies could increase the transparency about their corporate social responsibility (CSR) investments to encourage investors to invest in ethical products so these lead to raising CSR standards in companies, and therefore, sustainable development. Social implications - The Spanish socially responsible investment retail market is still at an early phase of development, and regulators should promote it in order to encourage firms to adopt business activities that take into account societal concerns.

The theoretical foundation of the proposed equity analysis is grounded in the area of social welfare theory. The ontology was verified and validated using automated consistency checking, automated redundancy checking, expert evaluation, and real-life case study evaluation. The proposed ontology-based system may support infrastructure system decision-making by assessing the social (group) welfare based on the economic, social, and environmental benefits of transportation project alternatives and taking stakeholder preferences into account, and may lead to better identification of the alternative(s) that offer the highest social welfare. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Benefit analysis; Information and knowledge management; Knowledge-based computer models; Ontology; Project planning and design; Social welfare theory; Stakeholder management; Sustainable infrastructure development","Decision making; Design; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Semantics; Transportation; Benefit analysis; Computer models; Information and knowledge managements; Project planning; Social welfare; Stakeholder management; Sustainable infrastructure; Economic and social effects"

Other ethical framings have been subordinated, marginalized, or denied. Through the explicit commitment of prominent international certifying bodies of management education, educators, researchers, and practitioners will be encouraged to give increasing effect to the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME). The PRME is a United Nations-led, institution-level mechanism for reorienting the direction of business schools and for increasing both educator and student capacities to contribute to a more inclusive and sustainable mode of development globally. We propose greater emphasis be given to various forms of relational ethics from which to guide the functional aspirations of institutions. We explore the creative opportunity for institutional change by contrasting the prevailing Western economically driven instrumental institutional logic with indigenous ethical framings. We draw upon Seo and Creed's conceptual framework of institutional change to discuss two films-Mann v.Ford and Waste = Food-to bring greater attention to the generative potential of indigenous perspectives in institutional praxis. Our examples could equally invite an application of other systems of relational ethics that have been overshadowed by the current domination of economic instrumentalism in almost all realms of decision making.

The redesigned course should help students understand our threshold conception that business has social, environmental, and economic responsibilities that are interconnected and interdependent. This study shows that multiple, interconnected theoretical concepts can serve as threshold conceptions in certain disciplines.

We provide a conceptual framework for evaluating the communication strategies a (landlord) Port Authority (PA) relies on in the management of its relevant stakeholders and the adoption of disclosure to critical issues. The theoretical arguments are supported by empirical evidences from the Port of Rotterdam (PoR), i.e. a major port which leverages disclosure to successfully manage stakeholders and support the implementation of corporate strategy. The research questions are addressed using a content analysis on the annual reports (ARs) of PoR in the period 2000–2012. The overall research design enables the investigation of PA disclosure as a tool for managing the evolving interests of stakeholders from a longitudinal perspective. The PoR case shows that the relative importance of topics reported in the ARs change over time, as a result of external pressures and internal key events. The outcomes demonstrate the growing attention of PoR on topics relevant to the broader community (e.g. environment and safety/security) after a period characterised by a prominent focus on financial and governance issues. Besides, key breakthrough forces stimulating the shifts in landlord communication strategies are identified and discussed. Finally, by suggesting an indirect approach to evaluate how PA prioritises its salient stakeholders, the paper adds to extant port literature and brings methodological implications. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","disclosure; longitudinal analysis; Port Authority; salience; stakeholders",

Yet there is currently no theoretical lens through which to understand the nature of - and psychological contributors to - these employee-stakeholder relationships at the individual level. Drawing on social identity theory, the proposed framework reveals that when an employee identifies strongly with the organization, this affects the way the employee views external stakeholders in the social landscape at work, resulting in some surprising consequences. Specifically, when organizational identification is heightened, an employee's engagement with external stakeholders will paradoxically become more adversarial and less collaborative. This effect can be attenuated, or even reversed, to the extent that (a) the employee construes that the stakeholder is an organizational member and (b) the organization's identity orientation is collectivistic. The proposed framework also reveals antecedents to an employee's construal of a stakeholder's membership in the organization - antecedents that are unique to the boundary-spanning context. © Academy of Management Review.",,

Specifically, through a combination of Stakeholder Theory and specific concept within the Innovation Theory framework (called Social Innovation Capital), this work explores the relation between effective stakeholder management and how marketable innovation production affects a company's possibility of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. By doing so, new insights on CSR management to gain competitive advantage are provided. Design/methodology/approach - The present study analyzes the role of a firm's international presence, and the company's social commitment initiatives as drivers of the enterprise's corporate intangible assets. A company's reputation has also been considered as a control variable. To achieve this goal, the Spanish market was analyzed. Specifically, those Spanish companies who had the highest reputation in the global reputation pulse and showed the highest level of brand awareness, according to the latest report published by the Forum of Leading Spanish Brands, were considered. Findings - Findings show that companies including their stakeholders' interests in the knowledge-creation and innovation process are able to enhance their intangible assets and thus the capitalization of such knowledge. Similarly, firms with international presence have a large number of global stakeholders, which also evidences a positive relation with its intangible assets. By honoring the social contract, firms benefit from stakeholders while contributing to social welfare, creating a win-win situation. Originality/value - This study categorizes how intangible assets can be increased through stakeholder's involvement and firm's international presence. Consequently, researchers studying business strategy can incorporate these variables as key elements in strategic planning. Scholars in fields of information systems, operations management, knowledge or supply chain management can also evaluate the inclusion of corporate social responsibility into their studies to evaluate how it reflects on tangible assets, production process, supply chain management or the knowledge production life cycle.

With fundamental design principles founded on definitive risk allocation, this transactional based approach fails to acknowledge or foster the cooperative relationships considered to be vital to the success of any project. Contractual design encourages stakeholders to defend their own individual interest to the likely detriment of project objectives. These failings are not disputed, however, given that trust is a fundamental requirement for human interaction the influence of trust is potentially important in terms of stakeholder relationships and ultimate project success. Trust is therefore examined within this context. A conceptual framework of trust is presented and subsequently used to code and analyse detailed, semi-structured interviews with multiple stakeholders from different projects. Using a phenomenological investigation of trust via the lived experiences of multiple practitioners, issues pertaining to the formation and maintenance of trust within traditionally procured construction projects are examined. Trust was found to be integral to the lived experiences of practitioners, with both good and bad relationships evident within the constructs of traditional procurement mechanisms. In this regard, individual personalities were considered significant, along with appropriate risk identification and management. Communication, particularly of an informal nature, was also highlighted. A greater emphasis on project team selection during the initial stages of a project would therefore be beneficial, as would careful consideration of the allocation of risk. Contract design would also be enhanced through prescriptive protocols for developing and maintaining trust, along with mandated mechanisms for informal communication, particularly when responding to negative events. A greater understanding regarding the consequences of lost trust and the intricacies of trust repair would also be of value. © 2015 Scott Strahorn, Thayaparan Gajendran and Graham Brewer.","Relationships; Traditional project procurement; Trust; Trust repair",

Conversely, a lack of supplier awareness, negative perceptions and inadequate government support are identified as barriers to SSCM implementation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Barriers; Corporate social responsibility; Motivators; New Zealand; Stakeholder theory; Supply chain management; Sustainable supply chain management","adoption behavior; corporate strategy; risk; social network; stakeholder; sustainability; New Zealand"

Multi-value Qualitative Comparative Analysis (mvQCA) was used to examine the events that took place during a large Dutch Design, Build, Finance and Maintain (DBFM) transportation infrastructure project. The analysis found that most events were social in nature. Private managers' responses to these events were internally-oriented and resulted in dissatisfactory outcomes. In contrast, externally-oriented managerial responses were associated with satisfactory outcomes. The article concludes that both public and private managers need to invest sufficiently in stakeholder management resources and capabilities when implementing projects. Although the intention of DBFM contracts is to lower the burden on the government, public managers still play an important role as intermediaries between the contractor and the local stakeholders and this role should not be underestimated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and International Project Management Association.","DBFM; MvQCA; Project implementation; Project management; Public-private partnership; Transportation infrastructure project","Project management; Transportation; DBFM; MvQCA; Project implementation; Public private partnerships; Transportation infrastructures; Managers; comparative study; project management; public-private partnership; qualitative analysis; stakeholder; transportation infrastructure; transportation system"

This achievement is challenging for management, as expectations from different stakeholders are only partly apparent and often conflicting. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a process model that supports the management of housing companies to systematically explore, evaluate, and integrate stakeholders’ interests into the company’s strategic targets. Findings – The integrated process model improves sustainable value creation, as stakeholders’ interests are transparent and can thus be better satisfied. Research limitations/implications – Due to the action research design, further research cycles and empirical testing with other companies are needed before findings can be generalised. Practical implications – The process enables housing companies to focus on value-generating activities, to react timely to changing needs, and to improve their relationships with stakeholders. Management benefits from increased clarity and legitimacy for strategic decisions as stakeholder demands are made transparent and integrated into the strategic targets. Originality/value – Compared to common participation approaches, all stakeholder groups are consulted, and their expectations are documented transparently within the suggested process model. This results in a better foundation for sustainable management planning and decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Balancing of interests; Housing; Participation; Stakeholder involvement; Target setting; Value creation",

BoP projects address how companies contribute to fulfilling the needs of the poorest populations; increasingly, academics are applying theory to explain these projects. The need for integrating the BoP population into value-adding activities is widely acknowledged, but this is not yet reflected in supply chain management (SCM)-related concepts. The links to SSCM are frequently mentioned but in a scattered manner. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a structured literature review of BoP papers published between 2000 and 2014 in peer-reviewed, English-speaking journals available on Web of Science. A content analysis of BoP papers is conducted based on SSCM constructs from the framework presented by Beske and Seuring (2014). Findings – The frequencies of SSCM constructs identified in the BoP papers indicate the prevalence of SSCM arguments in the BoP discourse. Technological integration emerges as the core SSCM practice frequently identified and is contingent with a number of other practices. Further, SSCM practices including long-term relationship development, partner development, joint development, enhanced communication, learning, stakeholder management and innovation have regularly been referred to and are considered important by respective BoP scholars. The contingency analysis shows significant correlations among various pairs of categories and allows us to point to major lines of related arguments. Research limitations/implications – The paper offers insights into the potential links between the SSCM and BoP research streams and sets ground for further theoretical exploration of the subject. Limitations are the uptake of one particular conceptual framework, the selection of BoP papers for the review process and the interpretation of the frequency and contingency analysis. The paper offers a foundation for developing a research stream where BoP-related issues are integrated into research on (S)SCM. Practical implications – SCM has many practical applications, which help to establish and improve supply chain design and operations. This would benefit BoP projects and should improve their practical outcomes. The relevance of technological integration seems straightforward, but needs a lot of effort to be implemented in each single project. Social implications – BoP-related research has gained increasing attention in recent years and should help drive the global sustainable development agenda further in the respective geographic locations. Establishing capable supply chains that deliver sustainable outcomes will be at the core of such projects. This paper highlights fundamental practices for firms targeting BoP markets with an effort to alleviate poverty. Originality/value – The paper applies SSCM theory to analyze BoP issues and thereby interlinks the two research streams. Until now, research amalgamating the two concepts has been disconnected. Therefore, by providing an overview of existing publications, more focus for future studies is created, which is valuable and necessary for advancing both fields. Additionally, assessing BoP-type projects in low-income countries will allow the SSCM agenda to look beyond what is so far typically researched. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Base of the pyramid; Content analysis; Literature review; Supply chain management; Sustainability; Technological integration",

The purpose of this article is to provide an option for solving Jensen’s “problem of governance”; this approach will allow the agent to manage the stakeholders having ascertained that the needs of stakeholders overlap and, accordingly, the agent should be able to monitor multiple stakes as they are aligned. Design/methodology/approach – A Delphi method was used with the aim to achieve consensus about the interests of stakeholders for companies in Spain. The confirmatory phase was based on interviews to test whether the interests identified in the preliminary study match the interests that the IBEX-35 firms recognized in relation with their stakeholders. Findings – The main contributions are: the addition of a new interest-based perspective to the different classifications made by stakeholder theory; a solution to the diversity of indicators between stakeholders and shareholders; and, finally, a proposal for an integrated accounting system, incorporating economic as well as social issues employing a common metric (monetary). Practical implications – A new perspective focusing on stakeholder interests and the confirmation that interests may converge permits the control and management of multiple principals in transnational corporations operating in different countries. Originality/value – There is a gap in the applicability of stakeholder management that the interest-based perspective can help resolve; moreover the monetization of social value is an option to efficiently manage transnational corporations. © FECAP.","Accounting; Social value; Stakeholder approach; Strategy",

This study examines how the public's perceptions of the distributional fairness of the benefits of mining, procedural fairness in the interactions between the mining industry and society, and confidence in the governance arrangements surrounding the industry affect the public's trust in the mining industry and, in turn, their acceptance of mining activities at a national scale. The aim of this study was also to understand how the contexts in which mining companies operate influence the public's perceptions of and attitudes toward mining. To this end, large-scale national surveys were conducted in Australia (N = 5121), China (N = 5122), and Chile (N = 1598). The results reveal that the key predictors of the public's acceptance of the mining industry were found to be relatively low across all three countries. In addition, distributional fairness, procedural fairness, and confidence in governance were all found to affect acceptance of mining, both directly and indirectly, by influencing the level of public trust in the mining industry. The findings also reveal that each of these three elements predicted trust and acceptance to varying degrees across the three countries. This suggests that the different elements are variously important to the public in accepting mining activities in their own contextual landscapes, highlighting that acceptance of mining is highly context dependent. The relatively low public perceptions of the three key predictors further suggest that in order to achieve a more socially sustainable mining industry where social conflict around mining operations is minimised and the public is able to experience the benefits of resource development, both the mining industry and governments may need to review their own methods of engaging with citizens to build trust in those stakeholder relationships. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Acceptance; Distributional fairness; Governance; Procedural fairness; Social licence to operate; Trust","Acceptance; Distributional fairness; Governance; Procedural fairness; Social licence to operate; Trust"

This study aims to investigate the status and the trends in megaproject research by conducting a structured literature review. A total of 85 relevant articles identified from eight peer-reviewed CEM journals between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed based on the number of articles published annually, institutional and regional contributions, citations, and categorization of research interests and methodologies. Analysis results indicated that developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, have enjoyed significant advantages in megaproject research because of their greater experience, while megaproject research in developing countries, such as Russia, India, Turkey, and Vietnam, remains weak or lacking. These results also revealed that many theory-based findings have been reported in five subareas; namely, construction and site management, cost and schedule management, risk analysis and management, innovation and utilization of information technology, and leadership and professional development. The subareas of organization and stakeholder management, project planning and procurement, and project monitoring and control remain to be promising domains for future research, particularly in developing countries which have yet to develop a research tradition.

This paper also introduces a new process framework that can be instrumental to practitioners and can be operationalised by researchers. Design/methodology/approach-The paper is underpinned by social strategy literature, the service-dominant (S-D) logic framework of value co-creation, stakeholder thinking and the creating shared value (CSV) framework. The process framework is based on the P.A.S.C.A.L. (perception, analysis, synthesis, choice, action and learning) decision-making process introduced by Goodpaster (1991). Findings-Although the evidence that we have presented shows that some clubs are already applying some of the strategies that are part of our process framework, the paper highlights further opportunities particularly for clubs with less-developed social schemes. Research limitations/implications-This paper is a conceptual paper based on an ongoing multi-case study of four English Premier League clubs. The evidence we introduce is to bring our proposed process framework to life. As implications for future research, the process framework can be tested empirically. Future studies might also focus on how the international footprint of the community trusts influences their strategic integration with the rest of the club. Lastly, the leader plus team might be used as a new unit of analysis in future research. Practical implications-This conceptual paper can mitigate the separation fallacy that decouples social schemes from football and commercial objectives. Our process framework illustrates how stakeholder relationships are governed and lead to value creation. The strategies within the CSV framework are a roadmap for expanding social and economic value co-creation. Social implications-Our process framework for collaborative value co-creation can guide practitioners on how to develop and implement their social strategies.

Previous research on CSR in Europe has made few attempts to identify stakeholders and their contribution to this topic. Design/methodology/approach - To derive this map, publicly available documents were explored, augmented by 27 interviews with key stakeholders (consumers, media, government, trade unions, non-profit organisations [NPOs], banks, certifiers and consultants) and management of different companies (multinational enterprises [MNEs], small- and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] and large national companies). Using MAXQDA, the quantified codes given for power, legitimacy and urgency were triangulated between self-reporting, external assessments and statements from publicly available documents and subsequently transferred into stakeholder priorities or, in other words, into positions in the map. Further, the codes given in the interviews for different CSR interests and the results from the document analysis were linked between stakeholders. The identified concerns and priorities were quantitatively analysed in regard to centrality and salience using VennMaker. Findings - The paper identified SMEs, MNEs and cooperating NPOs as being the most significant stakeholders, in that order. CSR is, therefore, not driven primarily by regulators, market pressure or customers. Further network parameters substantiated the importance of SMEs while following an unconventionally informal and idiosyncratic CSR approach. Hence, insights into these ethics-driven, unformalised business models that pursue broader responsibility based on trust, traditional values, regional anchors and the willingness to ""give something back"" were formed. Examples of this strong CSR habit include democratic decisions and abolished hierarchies, handshake instead of formal contracts and transparency in all respects (e.g. performance indicators, salaries and bonuses). Research limitations/implications - In total, 27 interviews as primary data that supplements publicly available documents are clearly only indicative. Practical implications - The research found an innovative, vibrant and practical CSR model that is emerging for reasons other than conventional CSR agendas that are supposed to evolve. In fact, the stakeholder map and the CSR practices may point at a very different role businesses have adopted in Switzerland. Such models offer a useful, heuristic evaluation of the contribution of formal management systems (e.g. as could be found in MNEs) in comparison to the unformalised SME business conduct. Originality/value - A rarely reported and astonishing feature of many of the very radical SME practices found in this study is that their link to commercial strategies was, in most cases, not seen. However, SMEs are neither the ""poor relative"" nor the abridged version of CSR, but are manifesting CSR as a Swiss set of values that fits the societal culture and the visionary goals of SME owners/managers and governs how a sustainably responsible company should behave. Hence, as a new stance and argument within CSR-related research, this paper concludes that ""informal"" does not mean ""weak"". This paper covers a myriad of management fields, e.g. CSR as strategic tool in business ethics; stakeholder and network management; decision-making; and further theoretical frameworks, such as transaction cost and social capital theory. In other words, this research closes scientific gaps by at once applying quantitative as well as qualitative methods and by merging, for the first time, network methodology with CSR and stakeholder research. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Network analysis; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Stakeholder analysis; Switzerland",

Acquiring another language provides the tools for interpreting that culture's values and rules guiding social engagement. Hundreds of millions of consumers are currently learning and using English as a second (or third, etc.) tongue. To what extent does this appropriation of English entail convergence towards the consumption values/behaviors of consumers living in the Anglo world? Objective: This international study examines the impact of language, specifically multilingualism, as a conveyor of culture and shaper of consumer behavior. Method: Over 2000 individual consumers were surveyed in eight countries (Sweden, Hungary, Greece, Mexico, Chile, Canada, Korea, and India). A quantitative questionnaire included an array of measures related to use of various languages, along with numerous items to tap each of the multifaceted cultural constructs and consumer dispositions, along with many food behaviors, and pertinent demographics. For each language (vernacular, English, and up to two others) two components (media, interpersonal) are linked to ethnic identity, global acculturation, consumer dispositions (cosmopolitanism, consumer ethnocentrism, and materialism), and the consumption of various foodstuffs. Results: Subsequent to factor and reliability analyses, a series of comparisons were made on the construct interrelationships, between high- and low- context languages, as well as between bilingual and multilingual consumers. The findings demonstrated that acquiring English espouses numerous values and behaviors characterizing global consumer culture, including enhanced materialism and cosmopolitanism, and diminished levels of consumer ethnocentrism and communication in the vernacular. Consistent with cultural integration, however, English usage promoted the interpersonal expression in minority tongues. The various languages considered-in isolation and in tandem-were significantly linked to food consumption and several acculturation patterns were identified. Conclusion: Asymmetries are present between monolingual Anglo-American marketers and their potentially bilingual/multilingual consumers. As consumer behavior becomes more global, its meaning remains partially embedded in local terms, even among English-fluent consumers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Bilingualism; Culture; English; Ethnic identity; Globalization; Language",

Companies consider territorial specificities when selecting a location (e.g. low production costs, highly qualified labor pool) in a utilitarian perspective. This research proposes encouraging companies to consider territory as a value creation network where exploitable resources flow. The proposal presented in this paper is to integrate these latent territorial resources into the product development process to create value for both the company and its territory in a sustainable perspective. The literature review highlights that current eco design practices have great impact on territories, but that this dimension is not considered in terms of resources. Moreover, current assessment practices are not adapted to overall performance evaluation and need revision to meet the system innovation goal. After clarifying the concept of territory, two industrial cases are provided to analyze how territorial resources were included in the design process and how it improved the overall performance of the company-territory system. From the success factors emerging from literature and cases, a method to release the potential of territorial resources is presented. A revised strategic process dedicated to senior management is proposed as the enabler of system innovation with the intention of improving the design of sustainable products. This paper concludes with the necessary cultural evolution that every stakeholder in the value network must undergo to promote territorial values in a sustainable perspective.

It examines the role-model status and obligations of the business leaders who direct such activity. This approach has two potential benefits. First, since ethicists often appeal to role-model obligations and many are concerned about corporate political activity, business ethics literature would benefit from expanding the examination of role-model status and obligations to encompass the business leaders who direct political activity. Second, it will help ethicists determine what we should demand from business leaders who direct such activity. This is important given the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010 that guarantees corporations the free-speech right to make political expenditures in support of political causes. I seek to demonstrate that we should hold business leaders morally accountable for how they direct political activity because of their role-model status that arises from their greater fame, authority, or power than ordinary persons possess. © 2015 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Specifically, it explores the environmental activities and social engagements of a sample from the largest 200 companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through a questionnaire survey posted to 200 listed companies. Fifty-one usable responses were received. The companies were analysed based on size, ownership and geographical scale of business. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and Mann- Whitney U tests were used for hypotheses testing. Environmental Activity Percentage Score (EAPS) and Socially related Activity Percentage Score (SAPS) were calculated to measure the extent of companies' CSR engagement with regard to environmental and social activities, respectively. Findings - Social issues such as unemployment and poverty, the typical issues in developing countries, often override environmental issues. This is more prominent in Sri Lankan-owned companies than those with overseas ownership. The explanation for this may involve historical, cultural and religious elements. Overall, corporate managers in Sri Lanka are concerned with social issues. Practical implications - The findings indicate that environmental practices are not widespread in the Sri Lankan corporate sector. It appears that environmental consequences are not taken into account in formulating business strategies, especially by local companies.

The notions of property and contract, traditionally thought to ground such a right, are now widely recognized as incapable of playing that role. This leaves shareholder theorists with two options. They can either abandon the project of arguing for their view on broadly deontological grounds and try to advance consequentialist arguments instead or they can search for other morally relevant properties that could ground shareholder rights. The most sustained argument in the latter vein is Marcoux's attempt to show that the vulnerability of shareholders mandates that managers are their fiduciaries. I show that this argument leads to the unacceptable conclusion that it would be unethical for corporations to make incomplete contracts with nonshareholding stakeholders. © 2015 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

The article presents a variety of papers that document leading examples of recent developments in understanding and knowledge, before assessing gaps within current progress and posing questions and challenges for future research and practice. An overview framework is constructed to categorise the papers, and to illustrate key actors and factors for sustainable production and consumption. The themes covered include specific examples of progress in areas such as sustainable production, covering topics such as eco-efficiency, waste management and the use of renewable resources, as well as sustainable consumption and the role of consumers. Supporting actions and themes are included, showing recent advances in design and innovation for sustainability and the role of assessment and benchmarking. Finally, contributions that consider how to connect production with consumption, and upscaling and bridging, are examined. The article concludes by proposing that continued progress is reliant on further connecting production and consumption, and ensuring that consumer and user perspectives are integrated into innovation and design processes so as to overcome hindering factors such as rebound effects.

Findings – Sixteen elements are identified and presented in a framework along with their proposed constituents. The elements capture structures and management principles of supply chains that are important for social responsibility. Research limitations/implications – The elements provide a basis to better understand how social responsibility in supply chains is related to contextual factors. The framework of elements is still only an initial step toward enhanced understanding of how the context affects social responsibility in supply chains.

We report a quantitative study, conducted in Shanghai and based on 119 paired responses by government officials and business managers, which sought to establish the antecedents of co-operative business-government goal relationships. We found that business enterprises in China that were represented by managers with favorable attitudes toward ethics and social responsibility were considered by government officials as more inclined to engage in reflexivity, i.e. to hold open discussions with them about organizational objectives and procedures, with a view to mutual adjustment and improvement. Greater reflexivity was, in turn, more likely to lead to business-government relationships based on co-operative rather than independent or competitive goals. Given the considerable importance of business-government relationships in China, these findings imply that concern for corporate social responsibility (CSR) may be advantageous for firms there, and we discuss how the HRM function may contribute to development of suitable CSR policies, projects and practices, to greater reflexivity, and to the increased likelihood of establishing co-operative goals. © 2015 Australian Human Resources Institute.","Business ethics; Co-operative and competitive goals; Corporate social responsibility; Government-business relationships; HRM; Reflexivity",

Since every entrepreneurial venture is essentially a one-of-a-kind enterprise, each startup is a chance for the entrepreneur to express their unique vision, values, and goals. Philosophers would recognize this exercise as existential in nature. This paper explains how reading existential literature provides inspirational heroes for entrepreneurs seeking to build companies that stand out from their peers. The paper provides an overview and history of existentialism and then applies it to entrepreneurship. The paper is conceptual and provides a brief overview of existentialism and explains how it relates to entrepreneurship.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper tracks changes in the contents of the codes of large Canadian corporations longitudinally by analyzing their contents at two points over two decades, in 1992 and 2012. In particular, the paper tests three hypotheses related to the institutionalization of codes. Findings – It was found that the codes have become more prescriptive, they are more concerned with social responsibility and are more likely to identify their moral and legal authority. Overall, the fndings support an institutional interpretation of the observed changes. Research limitations/implications – While large corporations are critical in establishing new and innovative management practices, their selection as the study population limits the generalizabilty of the fndings. Another limitation of this paper is that it used an a priori determined set of items to analyze the contents of the codes and while this was needed to facilitate the comparison across time, it also meant that some important items were not clearly identifed.

Common accounting principles are primarily focused on determining annual profit/loss figures, contributing to shareholders' interests and paying taxes. This accounting model must be complemented with a new approach that can interact with stakeholders while informing them about the value that firms are generating.

This development has been recorded in the current academic debate, and the views regarding its implications for business, the state, and civil society diverge. However, there is agreement within the CSR and corporate governance literatures that there is a lack of thorough empirical studies of these effects. Based on a case study of the multinational wind energy company Suzlon Energy's CSR projects in rural India, this article contends that CSR projects implemented through cross-sector partnerships can help to build the capacities of civil society organizations (CSOs). Although the risk of corporate steering of the civil society agenda is reduced when CSR prioritizes community needs over business imperatives, CSOs tend to bear the highest costs in partnerships, through credibility losses and insecurity concerning project terms and funding, reinforcing the importance of critical cooperation and complementary core competencies in cross-sector partnerships. The results have implications for the strategies of corporations, CSOs, and governments as well as for the planning of national and international development aid. © 2015 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

In Part I, peace is defined as different, evolving visions and goals necessary for creating a more peaceful society and world. These seven aspects of peace also build on each other, collectively creating a more holistic, integrative view of peace for the 21st century, along with the need for various forms of nonviolence for bringing about these needed visions and goals. Each of these seven aspects of peace can also be seen as being based on certain underlining principles. What is most interesting to see is that these underlying principles seem to also be at work in the evolution of business ethics, implying that humanity is indeed moving towards addressing evolving aspects ofwhat must be addressed for creating a world that increasingly works for everyone.

Similarly to their public counterparts, private sector regulators set standards, apply standards, monitor for compliance, apply sanctions and require corrective action. Private sector regulation differs, however, in the source of authority, external oversight, analytical requirements, public participation and available sanctions. This article argues that supply chain management by firms goes beyond business objectives by creating positive environmental externalities for society, and that more systematic study of the similarities and contrasts between the two forms of regulation may provide valuable lessons for both. Further, it may be possible to increase the effectiveness of private sector regulation to achieve both public societal and private business goals. From a business perspective, supply chain management enables firms to strategically redefine their relationships with government, reduce uncertainty and promote goal-oriented collaboration. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Corporate environmental strategy; Environmental governance; Environmental regulation; Environmental supply chain management; Private sector regulation; Sustainable business",

We posit that as an organization’s susceptibility to institutional pressure increases, its proclivity to conform to and alleviate environmental concerns and pressures to establish or maintain its legitimacy increases. To explain variation in a firm’s strategic response to institutional pressures and its engagement in Corporate Social Action, we focus on two factors: public ownership and media attention. Analysis of the largest publicly traded German firms indicates that greater public ownership reduces a firm’s propensity to engage in Corporate Social Action, while firms with less public ownership are more proactive in social engagement. However, when confronting greater media attention, firms with greater public ownership are more reactive in pursuing conforming strategies and increasing Corporate Social Action engagement. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Corporate Social Action; institutional pressure; institutional theory; media attention; public ownership",

While the literature has concentrated on why downstream original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and retailers become ""sustainable,"" much less is known regarding why and how upstream suppliers implement sustainability practices. Based on findings from a cross-case analysis of eight first-tier (FT) suppliers and an integration of resource dependency theory (RDT), this study explores the drivers and mechanisms of FT supplier engagement in sustainable supply chain management. Suppliers need to understand the sustainability priorities of customers and stakeholders to derive the effective focus and depth of further upstream integration with subsuppliers. Therefore, the integration between the two functions that manage the relevant external interfaces, namely marketing (downstream and stakeholder communication) and procurement (upstream), appears to be the essential cornerstone to move beyond FT supplier compliance to actual commitment to sustainability practices. We present findings on how (1) stakeholder-related, (2) process-related, and (3) product-related drivers influence the choice and effectiveness of the procurement-marketing integration (PM integration) mechanisms. Stakeholder pressures are considered to be the principal drivers of sustainability efforts. However, on their own, they rarely provide sufficient grounds for permanent and embedded PM integration initiatives at FT suppliers. Evidence suggests that suppliers' commitment to PM integration is motivated by the opportunity to leverage sustainability initiatives in their product offerings and sustainability certificates recognizable by customers and secondary stakeholders. © 2014 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.","Case study; Cross-functional integration; Resource dependence theory; Sustainability; Sustainable supply chain management",

This paper aims to identify sustainability features and practices adopted in retirement villages and associated benefits to improve the life quality of older people. A case study of an existing retirement village 10 kms from Brisbane CBD was conducted involving a series of interviews with the village managers and residents together with documents relating to the village's operations and activities. The environmentally friendly features that were incorporated into the development mainly include green design for the site and floor plan and waste management in daily operation. More importantly, a variety of facilities are provided to strengthen the social engagement and interactions among the residents. Additionally, different daily services are provided to assist independent living and improve the health conditions of residents. Also, the relatively low vacancy rate in this village indicates that these sustainability features offer good value of money for the residents. The paper provides a first look at sustainable retirement villages in terms of triple bottom line sustainability with emphasis on social aspects, reveals the importance in maintaining an appropriate balance, and provides examples of how this can be achieved in practice.

Three approaches to character traits can be used to incorporate ethics into organizations: virtues (philosophical approach), character strengths (psychological approach), and competencies (management approach). The aim of this article is to clarify the concept of character traits, or virtues, and provide a unified operational version of it for incorporation into management. To this end, we first discuss the analogy among virtues, character strengths, and competencies.

Green demarketing refers to a strategy whereby a brand encourages consumers to buy less at the category level through purchase of the company’s brand for the sake of the environment. Two studies show that consumer motive attributions and attitudes may depend on the brand’s perceived fit with sustainable business practices. Specifically, results show that the brand’s environmental reputation is the strongest predictor of consumers’ responses towards a green demarketing campaign, with effects persisting above and beyond the influences of the brand’s length of commitment to environmental protection and consumers’ brand habits.

The validity of a discipline’s constructs is a prerequisite for effective theory development and testing. Construct validity thus lies at the very heart of both decision-making and scientific progress in marketing. The use of marketing instruments that do not demonstrate sufficient evidence of construct validity can lead to invalid results, erroneous conclusions and poor decision-making. Despite several attempts to develop an instrument to measure the corporate reputation of service organizations effectively, lingering doubts remain about the construct validity of several published instruments. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical data were collected from the clients of service organization using an online survey during three waves of data collection and scale purification. Invariance testing in two different service industries confirmed that the final instrument is completely invariant, suggesting that the measurement parameters of the measurement model are the same in both samples. Findings – Rigorous scale development led to the development of a 19-item instrument that effectively measures a large service organization’s corporate reputation along five dimensions, namely, emotional appeal, corporate performance, social engagement, good employer and service points. Research limitations/implications – The study was limited to the measurement of the corporate reputation of large service organizations. Practical implications – Given the fact that corporate reputation has been described as “the ultimate determinant of competitiveness” by some executives, the outcome of this study is a proposal that large service organizations measure this intangible asset along five dimensions, namely, emotional appeal, corporate performance, social engagement, good employer and service points. Originality/value – Despite several attempts to do so, a valid and reliable instrument to effectively measure the corporate reputation of service firms (particularly large ones) has remained elusive. After more than two decades after the first attempts at measurement, there are many who now call for improved methodologies and more valid instruments to measure corporate reputation, based on more rigorous theoretical and conceptual development.

In the conceptual model, we propose that three ethical frames of reference, represented by perceived organisational ethics, perceived employee ethics and reflective moral attentiveness, antecede ethical judgements, which further influence the ethical intentions of Millennials. Using structural equation modelling, we test the model for three different business ethics scenarios: paying a consulting fee, dumping hazardous waste, and running an offensive advertising campaign. The findings confirm the link between ethical judgements and intentions across the board, while the influence of the ethical frames of reference varies among the scenarios. We propose that the differences in the predictive ability of the ethical frames of reference depend on the nature of the ethical issue, which holds important implications for today's managers in their attempts to encourage ethical behaviour of Millennial employees. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,

Design/methodology/approach – The method is four-fold, weaving together an auto-ethnographic approach, a contextual dialogue between accounting academics and lobbyists, a Morris-inspired utopian metaphor and a stakeholder accountability event in the form of oral disclosures written as a song cycle. Findings – Current efforts at integrated reporting are unlikely to change how large companies do business in order to address the risk of climate change in the short term. If the UN reports on climate change are correct, the authors need to take immediate action. The authors argue that, instead of waiting for climatic disaster to lead to a paradigm shift in corporate practice, “monetisation” of the costs of climate change is one way to encourage integrated thinking and sustainable business models. This relies on existing finance and accounting discourse to create a new “field of environmental visibility” which engenders environmental awareness on the part of the world’s companies and policy makers.

Giving residents with disabilities a fair chance to access and participate in leisure and tourism activities will help nurture a more positive feeling towards tourism development amongst this group of people and extend it to their family members and friends. Using in-depth interviews with 32 people with disabilities in Macao, this study explores their experiences in accessing the city’s IR amenities and whether the degree of accessibility has any effects on their level of support for the gaming industry. Results indicate that people with disabilities have encountered physical, human, and economic difficulties before, during, and after their visit to an IR.

Design/methodology/approach: A proposed framework illustrates four factors that nurture socially driven service innovation in emerging economies: solution, inclusion, culture, and technology. Extant literature from studies in India, Latin America, and China illustrates distinct indigenous innovations and service relationships that exist at the base of the pyramid (BoP), which provides a foundation for a better understanding of socially inclusive service innovations. Findings: A conceptual model of inclusive service innovation reflects an integrated, virtuous cycle, composed of service relationships that stem from the BoP at various levels of analysis across different income segments. These findings suggest notable research directions. Practical implications: This study reinforces the importance of a solution orientation as a competitive business model to gain customer engagement. Social implications: Researchers and practitioners in emerging and advanced economies can use the approach suggested by this paper in their efforts to build sustainable business cultures and improve the well-being of society.

Or we may be managers, inspectors, or auditors who serve as the official 'complaint recipient' when one of our colleagues wants to report wrongdoing in the organization. Whether we blow the whistle or are tasked with cleaning up after someone else does so, we are better off knowing in advance how the whistleblowing process usually plays out. In this article we discuss the pragmatic implications of 30 years of systematic research about whistleblowing: who does it and when, and why they choose to report the wrongdoing internally (within the organization) or externally (to outsiders). To avoid external whistleblowing, which entails all sorts of costs for the organization, we recommend that managers take clear steps: investigate the allegations, make the results of the investigation known to those affected, correct the problem if one is found, and avoid reprisal against whistleblowers. These actions can increase the chance that information about organizational wrongdoing stays inside the organization, where it may be remedied, instead of being made public. © 2015 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","Business ethics; External whistleblowing; Internal whistleblowing; Organizational wrongdoing; Retaliation against whistleblowers",

Companies of all sizes follow the mistaken belief that their products and services are best sold through mega-customers with pervasive market reach, such as Amazon and Walmart. Far too many business leaders fail to realize—until it is too late—that the relentless pursuit of volume at all cost is not the key to long-term profits and success. The Customer Trap: How to Avoid the Biggest Mistake in Business is Thomas and Wilkinson’s sequel to The Distribution Trap: Keeping Your Innovations from Becoming Commodities, which won the Berry-American Marketing Association Prize for the best marketing book of 2010. The Distribution Trap contended that cracking the big-box channel is not necessarily the Holy Grail that many marketers assume it is. The Customer Trap takes this thesis to the next level by arguing that all companies, regardless of the industry there are in, should maintain control over their sales and distribution channels. Volume forgone by avoiding the mass market is more than offset by higher margins and stronger brand equity. The Customer Trap shows that giving power to a customer who violates ""the ten percent rule"" sets a company up for ruin. Yet, when presented with the opportunity to push more sales through large customers, most decision-makers jump at the chance. As a result, marketing has come to resemble a relentless quest for efficiency and scale. Demands from mega-customers in the form of discounts, deals, and incentives erode the integrity of the brand and what it originally stood for. Lower margins become the norm and cost-saving compromises on quality take over. In time, the brand suffers and, in some cases, fails outright. Stark examples from Oreck Vacuum Cleaners, Rubbermaid, Goodyear, Levi’s, and others illustrate the perils of falling into the ""customer trap."" This book demonstrates in vivid detail how to thrive by controlling your sales and distribution. The authors show how many firms, such as STIHL Inc., etailz, Apple, Red Ant Pants, and Columbia Paints & Coatings, have prospered by avoiding the ""customer trap""—and how your company can have similar success. What you’ll learn Why making a deal with a mega-retailer is often a bad idea How innovators allow mega-customers to dilute the value of their products and services, while letting them impose costs and force changes in strategic direction and operational control How to take back control of your sales and distribution, using the newest direct marketing techniques and the most innovative electronic platforms How innovators can avoid the distribution trap, build a sustainable business, and maintain the brand equity and margins of the products and services they worked so hard to create Who this book is for Leaders of businesses of all sizes. © 2015 by Andrew R.

We then draw on French phenomenologist Michel Henry’s theory of the subjective body to advance our understanding of ethics as endogenous embodied practice rooted in life. Through the experiential realities of our ethnographic work, we show how the two interrelated dimensions in which embodiment occurs (subjective body and organic body) operate at two interrelated levels (subjective and intersubjective experience) to advance theory on the implications of corporeal ethics in organizations. More specifically, by reclaiming and specifying the ontologically embodied and shared dimensions of ethical subjectivity in life, we show the emergence and development of an esprit de corps, which allows embodying collective ethical practice while resisting to continuous external pressures. © The Author(s) 2014","Banking compliance; business-ethics-as-practice; embodied ethics; esprit-de-corps; ethnography; Michel Henry; phenomenology of life",

In this article, we review the state of the scholarship on trust and identify those qualities of trust that are common in organizations at similar stages of economic development, referred to as its etic aspects. We then also distinguish those elements of trust that are, to the contrary, culturally specific or emic in nature.

Combined with the unique challenges of an operating entity, this could potentially expose the profitability of sustainable businesses on a daily basis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate employees’ justice perceptions of performance management practices in a company in the chemical industry. The population includes all the employees in the chemical industry that was used in this study. A total of 140 questionnaires were issued to all the employees in an organisation which had undergone a performance appraisal and 102 respondents completed the surveys, giving a response rate of 72 per cent. A cross-sectional survey design was used in this study. The justice perceptions were measured according to an existing framework developed by Thurston and McNall (2010). The framework is founded on a hypothesised four-factor model constructed according to theories on organisational justice. The employees of the organisation in the chemical sector were involved in this study. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to measure perceptions of justice based on theories on organisational justice. The measuring instrument used was based on recognised models and theories. The study supports the construct validity of the measuring instrument and the reliability of the scales used. The justice constructs were used to identify specific items in the performance management practice that required improvement. The implications of the results are that continual interventions are required if employee commitment and productivity levels are to improve, resulting in a positive impact on business performance. Significant differences in perceptions by demographic groups were reported and discussed.

The Brundtland report of 1987 did help in setting the stage on sustainability for companies. However, in India one of the business models which lack several aspects of sustainability is e-Retail or the electronic retail. This paper outlines the need of sustainable business and also determines important parameters for sustainability of business. Further, the paper also analyses the sustainability of Indian e-retail business. The main agenda for most of the Indian e-retailers has been customer acquisition. Spending big bucks on marketing, and brand building is something which is seen round the clock 365 days a year. The aggressiveness of the e-retailers definitely makes sense in the Indian economy given the fact that the penetration of e-retail in overall retailing market in India is still in its infancy (with penetration less than 3 per cent). The companies in India are following a similar paradigm which was fooled by the global players like eBay Inc. and Amazon Inc. in the United States. Also, private equity players and venture capitalists are supporting the e-retailers by making massive investments which are purely based on base line assumption of promising future returns the business the investors would make. However, on the contrary, if the Indian e-retailers continue to offer huge discounts, they will only attract volumes thereby gaining significant market share but it would lead to un-sustainability as profitability with such deep discounts remains a distant dream. Lastly, the paper also makes a qualitative and quantitative correlation of emergence of e-retail in developed economies like US, UK along with developing economies like Brazil and Chine to that of Indian market. This correlation helped in understanding the tipping point post which a change in strategy for Indian players and increased focus on profitability will only result in sustainable business model. It is inferred from the analysis that the Indian e-retailers will have to relook their strategy and change their focus on profitability. This can be achieved by two means- one by means of cost optimisation and other by discount reduction. Cost optimisation techniques would involve reduction of cost in overheads like employee cost, fulfilment cost, payment gateway cost, logistic cost and others. This would be possible by inorganic growth route as the players have positive gross margins while negative operating margins which indicates high cost in operations. The paper outlines that the tipping point will be the ideal penetration of e-Retail in India and beyond this point players have to shift focus solely on profitability and returns. If not done, the companies won’t sustain in the market and continuous triple digit growth and whooping valuations will result in a bubble which will eventually burst. © 2015 Niraj S, et al.","Business sustainability; E-commerce; E-retail; Tipping point",

From this single in-depth case study and a comprehensive literature review, a model is developed comprising the necessary components to succeed in tribe building efforts in social media. These components include social cohesion of the inner tribe (founders) in terms of vision, the creation of an icon (a loudspeaker concept) that is able to generate strong customer response, and shape the brand or e-brand, which in turn can create a market and a sustainable business.

But it fails to address Coase's 1937 'killer questions', his pointing out that we have no rigorous theory of the firm that can explain or justify their existence. In particular we have no theory of how real people, as opposed to computational devices, fit into notions of the firm that can address Coase's critique. This is surely a problem for those teaching firm management in business schools and elsewhere - albeit an elephant that has been swept under the carpet. This paper sketches a theory of the firm that stands on the managers' creative judgments that their reasoning supports but does not dominate; hence the 'theory of the managed firm' (TMF) rather than merely the 'theory of the firm' (ToF). Along with Adam Smith, I presume human judgment is the source of all new economic value and so see the managed firm as democratic capitalism's principal apparatus for channeling creative inputs into the socio-economy. Thus managers have both economic and political functions. Firms generate value as managers contribute their judgment in the course of shaping their firm's responses to the Knightian uncertainties (KUs) and bounded rationalities (BRs) met with as the firm's freely chosen goals are pursued. Under KU/BR, an analysis of managers' agentic activity and rhetorical practice complements their rational decision-making and helps us see more of the nature of the managed firm. The TMF provides a post-positivist basis for re-theorizing entrepreneurship, business leadership, strategizing, and innovation management. Practice rather than theory is its basis. It also rejects the 'separation thesis' of the business ethics literature, and so provides a theoretical basis for an ethics of managing. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

We tested this theory with full-network data collected over three years from employees in a small functional-form organization, which we analyzed with a methodology drawing from the social relations model of interpersonal perception and Bayesian models for social network analysis. We found that, over time, the affective value of social relationships influences both perceptions of instrumental value and the formation of task-related ties through multiple paths not accounted for by either perceived instrumental value or formal-structural requirements. We also show that the emergence of task-related networks rests primarily on high-activation positive emotions, such as excitement (a subjective state of feeling energized) rather than positive emotions with lower levels of activation, such as pleasantness (a subjective state of feeling gratified).

To examine this problem, it draws on a presentation of the famous conception of property elaborated at the beginning of the previous century by the famous French lawyer Léon Duguit (1859-1928), and then intends to reflect on possible lessons that could be learnt from his project. Duguit, generally recalled as one of the main inventors of the notion of public service, intended a very radical critique of property on a sociological ground. His project could therefore be qualified as a pre-kelsenian socio-positivism. Drawing widely on the work of his Bordeaux colleague Émile Durkheim on the ""divison of social labor"", property should not be considered as a natural consequence of individual liberty, but, on the contrary, as part of inter-individual relationships and, eventually, of social solidarity. Hence, property should not be founded on individual free will, but on its ""social function"". This radical statement, however, cannot hide the fact that such function appears to be less an objective fact than the very expression of Duguit's claim for social justice; which explains many of the difficulties he encountered in order to define precisely what it means, how it works and by whom it should be determined. Duguit's ambitious attempt of a re-foundation of law, beyond the distinction between public and private law, thus bumps into the very uneasy articulation between facts and values. Finally, he seems to reconsider the sociological ground of the rule of law in a subjectivist light (referring to ""individual consciousness""), counterbalanced by universal conceptions of justice that can be traced back to Saint Thomas Aquinas. But this appears to be insufficient in order to define precisely a social function: consequently, his entire project tends to appear as a mere transformation of the sole justification of property, rather than as an actual limitation of it. Duguit's work, as a matter of fact, did not serve to justify the first French nationalizations, and even the modern notion of public service is only partially grounded on his views. But these limits of Duguit's project should not suffice to condemn it once and for all; on the contrary, his courageous attempt to face the problem of justification and enforcement of social justice can still be considered as a source of inspiration for social and political thinkers. The idea that property lies ultimately, not in a relation to things but on a relation between people can thus be illustrated in various ways in contemporary works in philosophy, sociology and political economy. First of all, this leads to recent attempts by André Orléan, a member of the French School of Regulation, to criticize the notion of value that can be found in standard political economy. In his view, value is to be considered not as a substantial property of goods, but as a result of the dynamics of social interactions on a given market. Consequently, appropriation, far from being the pure expression of free will, appears to be lead by unconscious social imitation. On the one hand, such analysis goes beyond Duguit's views in so far as it draws more radical conclusions of Durkheim's sociology: the actual ground of individual appropriation is not social solidarity, but social dynamics of valuation. Social interdependency does not spontaneously appear as harmonious but on the contrary, the failure of financial markets' self-regulation calls for a better involvement of State interventionism. But on the other hand, this theory appears to be not as ambitious as Duguit's, since it doesn't imply any consistent conception of social justice, nor does it reflect upon the role of law in social relationships. Thus, another and even more radical interpretation can be illustrated in recent public decisions to publically destroy massive illegal ivory stocks in order to confront the raising illegal traffic and the increase of elephant killings in Africa. Such gestures illustrate a concrete involvement of public institutions in the social dynamics of valuation. To fully understand them, one is forced to recognize their symbolical dimension, that is to say their self-attested, performative claim that these parts of animals cannot be recognized any value no more, and consequently, do not constitute goods that can be appropriated. Granted, these public destructions cannot constitute the unique way to fight illegal traffic and poaching, but they exhibit in a very pure way that the conditions of the very existence of markets and properties are not only social, but even public, and that they therefore involve political commitments. An anthropological look on modern social practices thus reveals that the search for alternative conceptions of property should also include institutional dimensions of social life. © De Boeck Supérieur.

It plays a key role in development and maintenance of relationships. Since many companies adopt social networking services for their organizational information sharing platform, it is important to identify the process of creating and maintaining social relationship in virtual spaces for successful adoption of SNS. In this research, we identify a selfdisclosure as a driving factor for initiating and maintaining online social relationships. This research assumes that the self-disclose strategy adopted by participants in a communication process would be very similar between a face to face communication and a communication through SNS. In addition, this study explores that how the strength of social relationship does affects participants’ self-discloser strategy in SNS. Self-disclosure on SNS is multidimensional and it consists of five dimensions; intent to disclose, amount, the positive-negative nature, the honesty-accuracy, and general depth-control of disclosure. Our research indicates that strength of relationship affect negatively the amount of disclosure on SNS. SNS users, in other words, less reveal themselves in terms of both frequency and duration to other user in strong tie than in weak tie.

We argue that both combinatory knowledge and new knowledge are accessed through collaboration networks, but that inventors' abilities to access such knowledge depends on its location in the network. Combinatory knowledge transfers from direct contacts, but not easily from indirect contacts. In contrast, new knowledge transfers from both direct and indirect contacts, but is far more likely to be new and useful when it comes from indirect contacts. Exploring knowledge flows in 69,476 patents and 89,930 unique inventors reveals evidence that combinatory knowledge from direct contacts and new knowledge from indirect contacts significantly affects innovative performance. Managerial summary: Inventors often combine ideas to create innovations. To do this, they need ideas to combine and they need the ability to combine those ideas. Inventors can get ideas to combine as well as the ability to combine ideas through prior co-workers. Prior co-workers can share ideas that may be relevant for the inventor's project and can tell the inventor about other things that other people are working on, especially people the inventor may not know. This can help inventors easily learn about ideas from friends-of-friends. The ability to combine ideas, however, is much harder to pass on. Prior co-workers must carefully work with the inventor to teach him or her the complex processes of combining ideas. This means that it is very hard to learn how to combine knowledge from a friend-of-a-friend, but it may be possible to learn from prior co-workers. We explore this phenomenon in the social relationships of software inventors. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Innovation; Knowledge filter; Knowledge pool; Networks; Pipes; Tacit knowledge","Complex networks; Information management; Innovation; Knowledge management; Networks (circuits); Pipe; Collaboration network; Complex Processes; Innovative performance; Knowledge filter; Knowledge pool; Knowledge transfer; Social relationships; Tacit knowledge; Patents and inventions"

On the basis of insights from this review, we propose a dynamic, psychological model of how and why individuals strategically network, which marries social exchange and expectancy theories with the concept of relational schema to explain the networking phenomenon across dyadic and intraindividual levels. This conceptual model posits that a networking interaction, construed as an exchange of resources within a given network relationship at a certain stage of relationship maturity, affects the relational schemas of those involved in the interaction and that each networking partner’s relational schema influences each partner’s perceptions of his or her network relationship and guides individual decisions to network with a specific network contact.

Using the Theory of Reasoned Action, and reviewing the literature on traceability, social relationships, involvement, values, motivation, and distribution channels, the authors propose a model explaining the antecedents and consequences of local food consumption for both locavores and traditional supermarket consumers. Design/methodology/approach – Face to face interviews were conducted in supermarket and farmers market contexts in a mid-sized city in France. A structural equation modelling was used to explain the relationship between the examined variables. Findings – The results suggest that consumers in traditional food distribution channels are not very involved with local food products. Alternatively, this research shows that for locavores, traceability and social links are positively related to involvement with local food products, which lowers price perceptions and positively influences utilitarian shopping value. Originality/value – The research provides a first empirical and academic perspective on local food consumption within different food retail channels in Europe. Much of the recent results on locavores and their behaviours have been conducted in North America and/or have remained rather conceptual. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer motivation; Europe; Food retail; Involvement; Local food consumption; Locavores",

It also studied whether or not the type of relationship between the recommender and the person who receives the recommendation and the expertise of the recommender moderate the impact of incentivization on brand attitude. The results should enable brand management to improve the design of WOM campaigns. Design/methodology/approach – An experiment was conducted utilizing a sample of about 645 respondents in Thailand. In a 3 × 3 experimental design, three levels of incentivization and three types of social relationships were manipulated. All other variables were measured through a respondent-administered questionnaire. For incentivization of WOM, monetary reward and non-monetary reward are compared to a non-incentivized control state. The three types of social relationships are an authority relationship, a kinship relationship and a market pricing relationship between strangers as the control state. Findings – The results of the experiment show that the introduction of rewards for recommendations harms the attitude of the receiver of a recommendation toward the brand. The attitude of potential buyers toward the brand can be tainted by the impression that a brand has enticed friends and relatives into profiting from their relationship. The negative effects increase further with the introduction of cash rewards. Contrary to expectations, however, the social relationship between the recommender and the new customer did not moderate the effect of incentivization. Source expertise has a direct as well as moderating effect on brand attitude. Practical implications – The findings suggest that companies should use referral rewards with caution. Brand managers need to be aware that there is a trade-off between the advantages and the disadvantages of incentivized WOM campaigns. Recommendations have been derived about how to improve the design of incentivized WOM campaigns. Whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages probably depend to some extent on brand-specific factors such as brand strength and market- or industry-specific factors, such as a credence good quality within the industry. It also emphasized that WOM campaigns need to be carefully monitored by measuring customer attitudes toward the brand. Originality/value – Although past research provides valuable conceptual and empirical insights into consumer responses in incentivized WOM situations, most research has focused on the immediate effectiveness of WOM by measuring purchasing intentions. There is still a lack of information about how different kinds of incentivization affect customer attitudes toward a brand that incentivizes WOM, and how various relationship types moderate the effects; in particular, authority relationships have not yet been studied in this context. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand evaluation; Experimental design; Services; Social influence; Word-of-mouth",

In this research, we conducted a comparative multicase study on returnee entrepreneurs and local entrepreneurs in China. We found that at the early stage of venturing, returnee entrepreneurs emphasized formality more than informality, while local entrepreneurs stressed informality more than formality. However, the formality-informality balance among both returnee and local entrepreneurs converged over time in line with the institutional transition in China. Returnee entrepreneurs increased the emphasis on informality (but kept the dominant position of formality), whereas local entrepreneurs gradually shifted from informality to formality.

New knowledge should be created to develop new practices, competences and capabilities to overcome these challenges. Studies that characterise knowledge creation as a transformation process through the networks of social relationships and intra-organisational teams are needed to understand, and thus improve such processes in project environments. Structural, relational and cognitive dimensions of Social Capital (SC) influence the utilisation of knowledge creation opportunities inherent in project networks. Hence, SC provides the essential infrastructure for knowledge creation. A fresh approach to operationalising the concept of SC through social network analysis and content analysis is thus required. This paper develops and explores the conceptual relationships between knowledge creation and SC in the context of two live building projects. There are two main conclusions. First, structural network indices are indicators of knowledge creation opportunities but they should be considered in conjunction with the relational and cognitive dimensions to determine whether and how opportunities are being utilised. Second, project communication strategies should be designed to enable actors in structurally advantageous positions for knowledge creation to utilise these opportunities. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","absorptive capacity; knowledge creation; social capital; social network analysis",

We put forward a classification of actions which can be considered investments in social capital, that the entrepreneur could promote. This classification should help us to understand how to influence social capital assets, especially by SMEs. These kind of firms, that are distinguished by scarcity of resources, could significantly take advantage of actual and potential resources, as well as appropriable ones, embedded in social personal relationships.

Although the Internet reduces many distance-related frictions, local and distant funders exhibit different funding patterns. Local funders appear less responsive to information about the cumulative funds raised by an artist. However, this distance effect appears to proxy for a social effect: it is largely explained by funders who likely have an offline social relationship with the artist (""friends and family""). Yet, this social effect does not persist past the first investment, suggesting that it may be driven by an activity like search but not monitoring. Thus, although the platform seems to diminish many distance-sensitive costs, it does not eliminate all of them.

Using China as an empirical case study, we investigate two separate, but related, hypotheses on the financial benefits of political connections for a sample of 1,435 Chinese foundations from 2005–2011. This extends Western donation determinants literature to a Chinese context and political guanxi (social relationships where individuals or organizations exchange future favors or gifts) research to non-corporate contexts. Our empirical results show that there is no relationship between the presence of state employees on an NGO's staff (a measure of political guanxi) and private donations. However, there is a small but positive relationship between the amount of government funding an NGO receives (a signal of legitimacy) and private donations. These findings suggest that, in post-communist countries such as China, donors may not be seeking future favors from their contributions and instead are interested in developing a robust civil society with legitimate, high-quality NGOs.

The effects of diversity management on the extent employees feel their organizational environment is inclusive and on their attitudes and behaviour, are expected to be dependent on how diversity management is perceived by non-native and native Dutch employees in the organization. Drawing on social exchange theory, the authors expect that employees who positively value diversity management practices will reciprocate through showing attitudes and behaviours that are valued by the organization. Since social exchange refers to a social relationship between the employee and the organization that goes beyond the formal contract alone, the authors analyse affective commitment and organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) as employee outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – The authors analyse data from a quantitative survey of a sample of Dutch central government employees and use structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the consequences of diversity management across non-native and native Dutch employee groups. Findings – Results show that diversity management is associated with higher levels of inclusion which in turn boosts affective commitment and OCB of both non-native and native Dutch employees. Practical implications – The findings show that higher levels of diversity management is associated with an increased inclusive environment, which in turn boosts employees’ affective commitment and OCB. This effect is equal for social-demographic diverse groups. Public managers should therefore implement diversity management that focus on creating an environment that is inclusive for all employees. The positive employee attitudes and behaviour resulting from this can contribute to achieving organizational goals.

Ostrom",2015,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84938908152&partnerID=40&md5=2684a54feb4dc54471387563e82cdbb9","Exploring Ostrom's approach to property rights and institutions is fundamental to any effort aimed at ""reconsidering property"" by discussing the existing ""alternative conceptualizations"". Beyond the fact that Ostrom was the first to introduce a conceptualization of common property based on the notion of bundle of rights, a crucial point is her rejection of the ""a-temporal and a-historical perspective"" of Alchian and Demsetz's theory of property right. Ostrom explicitly affirms the political dimension of any system of property rights or rules. By political dimension, one must understand the rejection of any spontaneous, natural and individualist approach to property in favour of a view in terms of a system of rules that cannot be separated from a permanent collective action and deliberation and in terms of property rights as social relationships. The aim of this article is to highlight the contributions and limitations of Ostrom's approach to the understanding of the political dimension of property rights and institutions. Having briefly set out the research program, the foundations, the conceptual tools and the major results of this approach, I emphasize its three contributions: (1) the overcoming of the naturalistic bias in Samuelson's taxonomy of goods by the recognition of the social and political attributes of the notion of rivalry and exclusion; (2) the understanding of markets as diverse, complex and institutional construction in which collective action, law and political deliberation are present at all stages, even at the level of the definition and delimitation of the object of exchange; (3) the reflexivity of appropriators or users of common-pool resources when they have to shape and apply a system of rules. The limitations of Ostrom's approach to property and institutions concern the absence of any clear account of the nature of this political dimension. This is explained by the absence of a theory of institutional change in Ostrom's approach. It is only recently that this approach has started to deal with this issue. I show that the account of institutional change already provided is purely empirical and do not address the controversy that this issue has stimulated in several social sciences. This evasive approach to institutional change results in a weak historical view of the evolution of property rights and it undermines the ability to shape a theory that take into account the structural factors - asymmetries of power, inequality, etc. - that drive the relationships that humans have with the environment. © De Boeck Supérieur.","Diversity; Institutional change; Ostrom; Political dimension; Property rights",

Truckers, a spatially dispersed group of workers with a traditionally independent culture and a high degree of autonomy, are increasingly subjected to performance monitoring via fleet management systems that record and transmit fine-grained data about their location and behaviors. These systems redistribute operational information within firms by accruing real-time aggregated data in a remote company dispatcher. This redistribution results in a seemingly incongruous set of effects. First, abstracted and aggregated data streams allow dispatchers to quantitatively evaluate truckers’ job performance across new metrics, and to challenge truckers’ accounts of local and biophysical conditions. Second, even as these data are abstracted, information about truckers’ activities is simultaneously resocialized via its strategic deployment into truckers’ social relationships with their coworkers and families. These disparate dynamics operate together to facilitate firms’ control over truckers’ daily work practices in a manner that was not previously possible. The trucking case reveals multifaceted pathways to the entrenchment of organizational control via electronic monitoring. © 2015, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.","electronic monitoring; information; organizations; social control; sociotechnical systems; surveillance; trucking; work",

Design/methodology/approach – An empirical study using structural equation modeling tests the relationships among factors of the social environment in pre- and post-consumption evaluations with a sample of over 400 outpatients. Findings – The results indicate that service value evaluations are influenced by health-related communications with family before being diagnosed, opinions from family and friends in the decision-making process and interaction with other patients after choosing a hospital. The level of evaluation is mediated by how willing consumers are to exchange thoughts and ideas with others. Research limitations/implications – Future studies could consider the differences in gender and culture, and include more various resources such as patients from different hospitals and geographical areas for better generalizability. Practical implications – The paper identifies the importance of understanding how social relationships are involved in creating satisfied customers who will be loyal, generate good news and recommend services to others. The findings are conducive to planning and executing public relations strategies throughout the pre- and post-purchase process. Originality/value – Unlike the previous research that focused on service provider-oriented factors influencing customer satisfaction, the study investigates the effect of consumer-oriented social elements on service value evaluation to extend the horizon of public relations planning. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication strategies; Family involvement; Opinion leadership; Patient-to-patient interaction; Service value; Word of mouth",

This study contributes to better understanding of the mechanisms of boards within the tourism sector, more precisely, destination-based tourism organizations wherein several stakeholders collaborate. First, we examine how tourism directors perceive their roles including strategic, control and service roles. Second, as tourism organizations are in a constant need for development and innovation, we study the role of innovative climates as part of the board dynamics. Third, we compare limited liability companies with other tourism organizations to explore the influence of legal structure on the perception of board roles and innovation. The directors perceived the control and strategic tasks as the most relevant for the boards of tourism organizations. Furthermore, they reported generally high scores on climate for innovation with somewhat stronger emphasis on the performance-related climate factors “objectives – mutual and achievable goals” and “task orientation – focus on excellence” than the factors more closely related to social relationships (“support” and “participative safety”). Limited liability companies scored significantly higher on the control and strategic roles as well as the combined climate for innovation variable indicating a stronger investment in the organizations due to the legal responsibility linked to the role of director in such organizations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","board roles; boards of directors; climate for innovation; innovation; tourism","climate; innovation; organizational change; perception; stakeholder; strategic approach; tourism"

This situation has recently begun to change, particularly in gentrified urban areas where middle-class families are growing in number and family outings in bars and restaurants are becoming more widespread. This paper examines the new practices of family consumption from two perspectives: the providers and the consumers. Entrepreneurs shape family-friendly spaces by reducing boundaries between eating, drinking and playing and by offering out-of-home pleasures in home-like environments for both parents and children. They balance between accommodating the families and retaining their childless clients. Families that consume in the food and drink spaces are primarily local middle-class families, and fathers and mothers equally participate. This study further reveals that leisure time spent with the family cannot always be classified as leisure time as a family. Parental involvement with the children differs. We distinguish leisured caring time with high parental involvement, own leisure time mainly directed at parents’ personal activities and social leisure time mainly directed at maintaining social relationships beyond the family. We discuss earlier research on the complicated character of family leisure related to the caring duties of parents. Empirical evidence comes from an exploratory study of ten consumption spaces in the inner city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","consumer culture; gender; geography; leisure; popular culture; sociology",

The study was undertaken through an analysis of the key themes in the most recent literature. The paper uses a framework incorporating organisational and industry attributes, personal employee dimensions, work-life conflict and organisational strategies and examines these in relation to whether job satisfaction, organisational commitment and employee retention improve. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses employee turnover literature to underpin a discussion of successful talent management. Using a key word search in both the hospitality literature and more mainstream management research, it divides the literature into four themes, namely, employee attitudes, personal employee dimensions, WLB and organisational strategies for employee retention. Findings – The key findings emerging from this examination of the literature show that WLB appears to have become one of the key variables when addressing issues of employee management and retention. In the recent literature, the link between employee attitudes, such as job satisfaction and organisational commitment, personal dimensions, such as stress and alcohol abuse, and WLB have become closer and intertwined. These links assist in gaining more focussed strategies to assist in retaining talented staff. Research limitations/implications – The meta-analysis of relevant literature provides an understanding of recent thinking in the area of WLB, talent management and the retention of talented staff. The article reframes the key issues in light of changes in the work environment and presents a new framework for future research and industry application. Practical implications – Given that WLB has become such an important factor, it is critical that managers regularly monitor the levels of WLB being experienced by staff. As staff are not always aware of WLB being a problem until it is too late, managers will need to find appropriate methods for assessing the presence of problems in this area. Social implications – The development of WLB strategies within the hospitality industry will assist in providing a healthier lifestyle for employees. This will then positively impact on family and social relationships.

Social relationships at work are important potential buffers against these threats, but the corresponding psychological processes are still unclear. We propose that the subjective experience of high-quality relationships with supervisors (i.e., Leader-Member Exchange [LMX]) is one of the protective factors against psychological health issues at work and that this effect is mediated by psychological empowerment. We tested these assumptions with two studies (one cross-sectional and one time lagged) on diverse samples of employees from different organizations. The first study employed emotional exhaustion as the outcome measure; the second used depression. Results from both studies support the proposed process by showing that LMX positively affects empowerment, which negatively affects emotional exhaustion (Study 1) and depression (Study 2). Additionally, Study 2 also showed that Team-Member Exchange is as important as LMX for preventing psychological health issues among employees. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Depression; Emotional exhaustion; Leader-Member Exchange; Psychological empowerment; Team-Member Exchange",

Drawing on embeddedness theory and the institutional logics perspective, we argue that embeddedness in a family, in particular the nuclear family, can strengthen identification and commitment to the firm, but can also induce owners to behave more conservatively. Consistent with this argument, we find that family-owned firms have higher profit margins, returns on assets, and survival rates compared to single-owner or unrelated-owners' firms, but also invest and grow more slowly, hold greater reserves of cash, and rely less on external debt. These differences are most pronounced when the two largest shareholders are married. Our results highlight the key role of marital ties in explaining differences in behavior and performance among firms. Managerial summary: Despite the prevalence of the married-couple ownership structure in firms, little research has been dedicated to understanding how these firms are managed and perform. We examine the behavior and performance of firms owned by married couples in a large panel of closely held Western European firms. We find that married-owner family firms are managed more conservatively relative to firms with unrelated owners and even to other family-owned firms. In particular, married-owner family firms invest and grow more slowly and rely less on external finance. However, they also exhibit greater performance stability and higher profitability. Our findings suggest that social relationships among owners have a large impact on firm strategy and performance, and highlight some potential trade-offs to performance when married couples control firms. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conservatism; Family ownership; Institutional logics; Marital ties; Social context","Profitability; Conservatism; Family ownership; Institutional logic; Marital ties; Social context; Economic and social effects"

The study findings indicate that, importantly, a consumer’s social relationship situation (social inclusion vs. social exclusion) with other consumers, self-affirmation (self-value/self-concept reinforcement), and the option popularity jointly influence consumers’ willingness to choose a green hotel.

The data were analyzed using constant comparative method and charted on a consensus map. Five themes have evolved from the consensus map: health, trying new food, sharing, enhancing knowledge, and happiness. Findings reveal that young Taiwanese consumers are health-conscious and have high acceptance of novel food. They perceive food as a means of enjoyment and fostering social relationships.

Using a 2 × 2 experimental design, we measured participants’ attitudes by employing a semantic differential scale and behavioral intentions by using a simple yes/no question regarding the action described. A questionnaire with 20 brief scenarios provided the euphemistic (transparent) versus non-euphemistic (less-transparent) condition. Oversight versus non-oversight conditions were manipulated through instructions to participants. Hypotheses regarding the effects of euphemism were supported; participants were both more likely to rate an action as appropriate and to indicate they would take that action when stated euphemistically. Oversight did not have a significant effect on attitude toward the action, but did significantly affect participants’ intentions to take that action.

To achieve this, we designed and built an immersive 3D simulation game in the style of a visual case. The effectiveness of the game was evaluated using a mixed methods approach measuring recognised and adapted constructs from the technology acceptance model. Results demonstrate that students found the game beneficial to their learning of ethics with the development of knowledge and skills applicable to the real world and that they engaged with the process due to game elements.

In this article, we explore the extent to which individualism moderates the relationship between organizational justice and OCB (organizational obedience, participation, and loyalty) among citizens in Kyrgyzstan. We make additional contributions to the literature because we know very little about these constructs in this former Soviet Union country, Kyrgyzstan, an under-researched and under-represented region of the world. Results of our data collected from 402 managers and employees in Kyrgyzstan offer the following new discoveries. All three justice constructs are related to OCB. Individualism moderates only the distributive and interactive justice to OCB relationships. We develop an intricate theory with provocative implications: Procedural justice produces obedience. For “individualists,” interactional justice inspires loyalty and, interestingly, distributive justice “can only buy” participation, but “can’t buy” loyalty.

The aim of this article, therefore, is to conceptualize the living wage (LW) in its philosophical as well as practical dimensions in order to open up the ethical implications of its introduction and implementation by companies. We set out the legal, socio-institutional and economic contexts for the debates around the LW and review arguments for, and against, it. Key philosophical arguments from the perspectives of sustainability, capability and externality are invoked and discussed in order to demonstrate the issues and challenges involved for companies, state and civil society actors. Relevant examples from the private sector are examined to demonstrate some of the practical issues involved when the LW is introduced by employers. The article also recommends avenues for a research agenda into the LW for business ethicists, CSR and management researchers in contexts such as the UK, where a voluntary, rather than mandatory, approach to the implementation of the LW is adopted. © 2015 The Author(s)","Business ethics; Corporate Social Responsibility; Living wage; United Kingdom; Voluntarism",

Focusing on three case study villages in Qiandongnan Hmong and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, we compare the livelihoods of one village without tourism to date (but slated for tourism development in the near future), one with a ‘medium’ level of tourism, and another where tourism is in full force. Our analysis of the transitional characteristics of these communities focuses on agriculture, income-related activities, cultural norms, and social relationships to shed light on the everyday politics of ethnic minority households under different stresses and demands from local government and state-controlled tourism businesses. We find that confrontations have arisen due to tourism expansion and state tourism planning directives among a wide range of stakeholders: Zhailao elites, core and peripheral tourism communities, country-level governments, local residents, and tourists. In turn, local residents have made broad concessions ranging from resignation to unwelcome changes in their livelihoods and new income inequalities, to acceptance of certain tourism-based changes and reallocation of resources. In sum, we find that villagers’ everyday politics involves coping with or challenging new tensions in diverse ways, yet at times marginalisation remains. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","ethnic minorities; everyday politics; Guizhou Province; livelihood diversification; tourism",

These social contracts are important to understand if firms are to adequately manage the privacy expectations of stakeholders. This paper explores a social contract approach to developing, acknowledging, and protecting privacy norms within specific contexts. While privacy as a social contract—a mutually beneficial agreement within a community about sharing and using information—has been introduced theoretically and empirically, the full impact on firms of an alternative framework to respecting the privacy expectations of stakeholders has not been examined. The goal of this paper is to examine how privacy norms develop through social contract’s narrative, to redescribe privacy violations given the social contract approach, and to critically examine the role of business as a contractor in developing privacy norms. A social contract narrative dealing specifically with issues of privacy is an important next step in exploring a social contract approach to privacy. Here, the narrative is used to explain to analyze the dynamic process of privacy norm generation within particular communities. Based on this narrative, individuals within a given community discriminately share information with a particular set of obligations in mind as to who has access to the information and how it will be used. Rather than giving away privacy, individuals discriminately share information within a particular community and with norms governing the use of their information. Similar to contractual business ethics’ impact on global commerce in explaining how and why norms vary across global contexts, the social contract approach to privacy explains how and why norms vary across communities of actors. Focusing on agreements around privacy expectations shifts the responsibility of firms from adequate notification to the responsibility of firms as contractors to maintain a mutually beneficial and sustainable solution. © 2015 The Author(s)","Fair Information Practices; Internet; Online; Privacy; Social contract; Technology",

In contrast to other prominent approaches to ethics, virtue ethics provides a useful perspective in making sense of various business ethics issues with an emphasis on the moral character of the individuals and its transformational influences in driving ethical business conduct. Building on Geoff Moore’s (Bus Ethics Q 12(1):19–32, 2002; Bus Ethics Q 15(2):237–255, 2005; Bus Ethics Q 18(4):483–511, 2008) treatment of Alasdair MacIntyre’s practice–institution schema, the paper discusses how individuals, as moral agents, can serve to promote virtuous business conduct and help foster a moral and ethical climate in the organization and in society at large.

It is noted that little attention is devoted to the explanation and application of ethics theory in business ethics textbooks, which suggests that ethics theory is held in low esteem by business ethics educators. This relative disregard has been justified by some critics on the basis of the limited usefulness of ethics theory to business ethics pedagogy. Notwithstanding these criticisms, the paper argues that ethics theory can play an important role in business ethics teaching which conforms to a speculative agenda. A speculative agenda is described, and a contribution that ethics theory can make to it is explained. This constitutes a form of immanent critique, which enables putative statements of business ethicality to be subjected to critique against the cultural values upon which their credibility rests. Ethics theory is offered as a mediating resource to facilitate such critique. Some criteria that the presentation of ethics theory needs to meet if it is to fulfill this speculative agenda are also outlined. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Business ethics teaching; Ethics theory; Immanent critique; Speculative method",

When two brands involved in CSR activities form a cobranding alliance, their respective CSR perceptions can impact consumer attitudes toward the alliance. As an ethically-oriented strategy, the alliance can be potentially beneficial to both partner brands, and can create opportunities for promoting CSR activities. The research streams on brand management, cobranding, and CSR, however, are silent about this important branding strategy that has several embedded business and societal benefits. This study examines how CSR-based consumer perceptions and ethical self-identity impact consumer evaluation of cobrands. Employing a quasi-experimental between-subjects design, the study tests six cobranding scenarios in three product categories. The data were collected via structured questionnaires resulting in 318 valid responses. The data were analyzed employing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The results confirm that positive CSR perceptions toward the partner brands are robust indicators of attitudes toward cobrands. Further, the match between the CSR activities of the partner brands (positive CSR fit) and the product categories (product fit) influences cobrand attitudes. The results also show evidence of ‘spill-over’ effects, where the alliance has a positive impact on subsequent CSR perceptions toward the partner brands. Additionally, the findings demonstrate an asymmetry in the effects of the cobrand on subsequent CSR perceptions wherein consumers with low ethical self-identity show greater spill-over effects from the cobrand than those with high ethical self-identity. The study contributes to knowledge in the domains of business ethics, cobranding, and social responsibility. The findings have managerial implications for designing CSR-based ethical branding strategies for cobrands. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Cobranding; Corporate social responsibility; Ethical self-identity; Partial least squares structural equation modeling; Spill-over effects",

In this study, previously un-researched areas of the difference between old and new media as well as competition among the new media are analyzed so as to suggest strategies for increasing the market share. The results showed that (1) Wechat, a service which has converged the positive attributes of old and new media, provided a high level of user gratification by meeting user’s diverse requirements, while Weibo beat other social media regarding information seeking because its network structure has advantage on extensive information acquisition. On the other hand, Renren was less competitive than Wechat and Weibo, but it still had its place as an information seeking media because of the plentiful amount of information such as pictures and videos. (2) There was keen competition among the media that provided high levels of user gratification. (3) Old media were competitively superior in media richness, equivocality reduction, and the social relationship, while new media were competitively superior in information seeking and remediation of media. The conclusions suggest that, for social network service/site-based new media to obtain the advantage in the media market, they need to provide users more diverse communication functions and a platform for more meaningful communications. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Media richness; New media; Niche theory; Social media; Social network service",

Through such an approach, the article gives an extrinsic motivation of the relevance of humility in business, and, from a theoretical point of view, links the intra-personal and intra-organizational perspective on humility to an inter-organizational one. The article contextualizes the virtue of humility by relating it to the economic, cognitive, and moral aspects of business practice and managerial work. It claims that the assumption of self-sufficiency in business is a grave misrepresentation of what business is—a practice characterized by interdependency.

We document a complex relation between management’s discussion of customer satisfaction and subsequently reported satisfaction.

This is not because of a lack of care or competence; rather, this situation points towards a more general tendency of education to become focused on economic growth, as Nussbaum (2010) claims. Revisiting the nature of ethics education, I argue that much moral learning occurs through the imagination, and not solely through the rational mind. Individuals are complex, and a great part of what we are lies below the threshold of consciousness. In this respect, ethics education must take into account the psyche and its influence on conscious behaviour, which can best be apprehended through the imagination. Echoing Jung’s concerns about unconscious and indiscriminate masses (the ‘million zeros’ of the title), I thus explore how imagination and creative material contribute to enhancing both self-knowledge and ethical reflection in the context of organisational life and business education. I especially consider how moral development and social awareness are tied up with individual psychological understanding, and argue that Jung’s analytical psychology offers insightful tools to explore our individuality. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Creative writing; Education; Fiction; Imagination; Jung; Moral development",

It is also regarded as both a catalyst and a solution to the 2008 financial crisis. Once a popular method of financing the mortgage and consumer credit markets, aspects of the global securitization market are now struggling to revive. In this paper, I discuss the role that ethics played in securitization prior to the 2008 financial crisis and find that it is not an obvious story of moral failures, but rather that it lies in more subtle elements of the financial system. The ethics uncertainty role in the securitization story is one of flawed incentives and the shifting of responsibility for handling risk. The role of securitization and the ethics of risk transfer have rarely been discussed explicitly in the literature. The historical origins of securitization and lessons learned from previous flawed uses of the process are also provided. I also detail the various global institutional reform proposals that have taken place. Moving forward, it is crucial to understand the causes, consequences, and ethical implications of securitization in the financial crisis so as to help individuals and managers better assess risk, align incentives, and design appropriate policy responses. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Asset-backed securities; Corporate responsibility; Credit crisis; Ethics; Finance; Finance ethics; Securitization",

If they do respond, are their responses simply neglect of areas associated with corporate social performance (CSP) or do they also cut back on positive programs such as profit sharing, public/private housing programs, or charitable contributions? In this paper, we argue that because CSP-related actions and programs tend to be discretionary, they are likely to receive less attention during tough economic times, a result of cost-cutting efforts. However, the various CSP performance areas vary in terms of their resource requirements and their influence on financial performance (short- and long-term), which suggests that firms may respond differently depending on area. Consequently, in addition to examining CSP concerns separately from positive actions and programs (CSP strengths), we also examine the influence of economic growth across the five areas of diversity, employee relations, the environment, product quality/safety, and the community. Based on data from 837 firms over 15 years, our results suggest that firms neglect some areas associated with CSP during economic downturns, resulting in increased concerns about community and employee relations, product safety/quality, and the environment. However, this relationship does not apply to positive actions and programs. Instead, firms tend to increase their positive CSP programs in areas such as diversity, employee relations, and the environment during periods of slow economic growth and reduce them when the economy picks up. We offer potential explanations for our findings and discuss their importance to research on CSP. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Economic cycles; Measurement of social performance; Recession",

The sample was composed of 1,445 employees from Spain and Austria. Results of structural equation modeling (SEM) supported mediation effects in both countries, especially for worries about a future deterioration of social relationships. Moreover, the study addressed the role of the economic and cultural contexts.

Using a vignette-based experiment, we found strong confirmation of the criticality of fairness in the firm–stakeholder relationship: stakeholder equity perceptions were unequivocally associated with the proclivity to sanction the firm, or to engage in prosocial behaviours of benefit to it. Stakeholder expectancy perceptions and resource dependence were related to only certain forms of stakeholder action, indicating that researchers should take care to differentiate between types of stakeholder response when investigating questions surrounding stakeholder mobilization.

Furthermore, consumers’ perceptions of retail business ethics exert a stronger effect on consumer trust in integrated social discount spaces, though social discount practices do not affect the link between such perceptions and loyalty.

Corporate commitment to preserving biodiversity is increasingly scrutinized by stakeholders and now represents an important aspect of business ethics. Although stakeholder involvement is often essential to the management of biodiversity, very few studies in the literature have focused on the details of this involvement. The objective of this paper is to analyze how mining and forestry companies can manage biodiversity issues through stakeholder involvement based on a content analysis of 430 sustainability reports using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework. The paper elucidates the reasons for such involvement, the nature of stakeholders involved, and the types of measures employed to manage biodiversity. Stakeholders’ motives for becoming involved revolve around four main issues: complexity and knowledge management; self-regulation and relationships with public authorities; legitimacy and social responsiveness; and commercial and strategic objectives. The stakeholders involved in biodiversity initiatives are essentially non-governmental organizations, experts and universities, public authorities, and coalitions of companies. In the end, the initiatives identified can be grouped into three categories: management practices, socio-political actions, and research and conservation measures. The paper provides various examples of these initiatives and shows how they can be implemented in collaboration with different stakeholders depending on the company’s objectives. The contributions the study makes to the literature on biodiversity management and the managerial implications of the study are analyzed in the discussion section. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Biodiversity management; Forestry; Inter-organizational collaboration; Mining; Stakeholder theory; Sustain ability",

Recent debates have explored whether these initiatives represent opportunities for the “democratization” of transnational corporations, facilitating civic participation in the extension of corporate responsibility, or whether they constitute new arenas for the expansion of corporate influence and the private capture of regulatory power. In this article, we explore the political dynamics of these new governance initiatives by presenting an in-depth case study of an organization often heralded as a model MSI: the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). An effort to address global deforestation in the wake of failed efforts to agree a multilateral convention on forests at the Rio Summit (UNCED) in 1992, the FSC was launched in 1993 as a non-state regulatory experiment: a transnational MSI, administering a global eco-labeling scheme for timber and forest products. We trace the scheme’s evolution over the past two decades, showing that while the FSC has successfully facilitated multi-sectoral determination of new standards for forestry, it has nevertheless failed to transform commercial forestry practices or stem the tide of tropical deforestation. Applying a neo-Gramscian analysis to the organizational evolution of the FSC, we examine how broader market forces and resource imbalances between non-governmental and market actors can serve to limit the effectiveness of MSIs in the current neo-liberal environment. This presents dilemmas for NGOs which can lead to their defection, ultimately undermining the organizational legitimacy of MSIs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Civic regulation; CSR; Deliberative democracy; Eco-labeling; Environment; Forests; Global governance; Gramsci; Multi-stakeholder initiatives; Non-governmental organizations; Transnational politics",

Our findings show that environment friendly firms pay their CEOs less total compensation and rely less on incentive-based compensation than environment careless firms. This negative relationship is stronger in institutional contexts where national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings have important theoretical meaning and practical implications. Results show that CEOs do not necessarily act opportunistically; rather some of them may be willing to act as stewards of the natural environment and accept a lower, less incentive-based compensation from environment friendly firms. This study also provides evidence of the important influence of the institutional context in setting-up CEO compensation as the relationship is stronger when national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings question the universal validity of agency theory in explaining CEO compensation. Compensation based on pecuniary incentives might be less indicated to motivate CEOs who feel rewarded by playing a stewardship role for environment friendly firms.

Although such considerations receive more attention in the ‘normative’ branch of the stakeholder literature, they have critical implications for ‘instrumental’ stakeholder theory as well. In research in the instrumental vein, although the position has seldom been articulated in significant detail, a stakeholder’s inclination to take action against the firm or, conversely, to cooperate with it, is often taken to be a function of its perceptions concerning the fairness or unfairness (or equity or inequity) of the treatment it receives in its relationship with the firm. Thus, from various works in this domain can be distilled what might be termed a ‘fairness-based perspective on stakeholder behaviour’. This perspective, as it currently stands, assumes a high degree of homogeneity in stakeholders’ responses to fair, unfair, or munificent treatment by the firm. This supposition is itself typically based on a presumption that stakeholders consistently and uniformly adhere to norms of equity and reciprocity in their relationships with firms. However, research developments in equity theory and social exchange theory suggest that such assumptions are likely untenable. Accordingly, in this work, after outlining the fairness-based perspective on stakeholder behaviour, I undertake to augment it by presenting propositions concerning the possible influences of stakeholders’ equity preferences and exchange ideologies on their propensities to sanction or support the firm. Incorporating these stakeholder traits into the fairness-based perspective should enhance the predictive validity of its propositions concerning stakeholder behaviour in response to fairness or unfairness in the firm–stakeholder relationship. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Equity sensitivity; Exchange ideology; Justice; Reciprocity; Stakeholder mobilization; Stakeholder theory",

Some factors were not determinants for the final outcome of the game. Other factors presented values much closer to the mean for winners than for losers. There were factors, though, which seemed to be determinant for winning the game: winners obtained much higher values with these factors. It could be perceived that this hands-on approach was well received by the students: the game boosted students' morale and interest in the subject; fostered entrepreneurship and less absenteeism; increased degree of class participation, awareness of team work and planning; created an environment which favoured discussion on business ethics; and provided motivation for further learning. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","Business Excellence Model; business game; Factor Analysis; Simulation and Gaming; teaching TQM",

They are considered in company with the third, complementary, idea of analysis. It is argued that the interplay amongst these is very important in business ethics. The relationship amongst the three ideas can be understood by reference to parts of modern cognitive psychology, including dual-process theory and the Social Intuitionist Model. Intuition can be misleading when based on fast and frugal heuristics, and reasoning needs social exchange if it is to support moral judgment effectively, but in the complex institutional environment of business, reflection and analysis can underpin social communication and feedback to develop sound intuition. Reflection and analysis are both more deliberate, systematic judgment processes than intuition, but are distinguished by the fact that reflection embraces hypothetical thinking and imagination, while analysis is careful, step-by-step reasoning. Examples of business ethics problems illustrate the need for both of these processes, and also suggest how they themselves can be enhanced in the same social exchange process that underpins the development of good intuition. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Analysis; Dual-process theory; Ethical decision-making; Intuition; Moral judgment; Reflection; Social Intuitionist Model",

This paper traces the conceptualisations and origins of the Circular Economy, tracing its meanings, and exploring its antecedents in economics and ecology, and discusses how the Circular Economy has been operationalized in business and policy. The paper finds that while the Circular Economy places emphasis on the redesign of processes and cycling of materials, which may contribute to more sustainable business models, it also encapsulates tensions and limitations. These include an absence of the social dimension inherent in sustainable development that limits its ethical dimensions, and some unintended consequences.

Meanwhile, the shares of total wage and welfare expenditures in total sales revenue are lower in these firms, which results in higher profitability. Moreover, firms with the governance structures invest significantly more into training and provide employees with better fringe benefits. Considering the low labor protection standard and the weak external regulations of China’s labor market, we explain the positive findings thusly: corporate governance structures induce managers to adjust wage payments to the “efficiency wage” level, which is the best balance point for the interests of both shareholders and employees and, therefore, for maintaining the stakeholder relationships.

This is achieved by drawing on concepts from Michel Henry’s phenomenology of life in the field of business ethics. The French philosopher Michel Henry (1922–2002) is distinguished by his identifying two modes of appearing: ‘intentionality’ (appearing of the world through representations) and ‘affectivity’ (appearing of life). Henry suggests that relying only on abstract representations constitutes a specific ideology that causes individuals at work to ignore the actual experience of being affected, and hinders the appearance of life to guide their actions, in turn hindering ethics. Empirical illustrations are provided by a case study that explores the practices of management accountants in a travel retail corporation. By observing the empirical practices of management accountants, a body of professionals whose role is largely dependent on information technology, abstraction and technical expertise to trace organisational flows and transactions, we shed light on the difficult ethical issues associated with their role of surveillance and control of other managers’ work. The case study illustrates a wide range of everyday working practices among management accountants. Some convey the impression that they lack empathy and consideration for other individuals, while others engage in close cooperation and ethical practices despite the constraining configuration of their role. A significant result of this research is that it illustrates and interprets, based on Henry’s phenomenology, a wide range of working practices. Consistent with Henry, we argue that the source of business ethics lies beyond professional standards, codes and values. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Financial controllers; Information technology; Management accountants; Michel Henry; Phenomenology; Work ethics",

In this study the intersection of these trends is examined through a content analysis of 112 publicly available social media policies from the largest corporations in the world. The extent to which social media policies facilitate and/or constrain the communicative sensibilities and values associated with contemporary notions of CSR is considered. Overall, findings indicate that a large majority of policies, regardless of sector or national headquarters, increasingly inhibit communicative tenets of contemporary CSR (i.e., free speech, collective information sharing, and stakeholder engagement/dialogue) and thereby diminish employee negotiation and participation in the social responsibilities of corporations. Moreover, policies generally enact organizational communication practices that are contrary to international CSR guidelines (e.g., the UN Global Compact and other international agreements). Findings suggest that social media policies represent a relatively unrecognized development in the institutionalization of CSR communicative norms and practices that call into question the promising affordances of social media for the inclusion of various voices in the public negotiation of what constitutes corporate social responsibility. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Boundary permeability; Communication rights; Corporate social responsibility; Dialogic processes; Employee communication; Social media policies",

We draw on mood-congruency theory and the affect infusion model to propose that mood influences managerial ethical decision making through deliberate and conscious assessments of the moral intensity of an ethical issue. By accounting for proscriptive and prescriptive morality—i.e., harmful and prosocial behavior, respectively—we demonstrate that positive and negative mood may have asymmetrical and paradoxical effects on ethical decision making. Specifically, our analysis suggests that individuals in a positive mood will be more likely to engage in prosocial behavior but less likely to refrain from activities that have harmful consequences for others, whereas individuals in a negative mood will be more likely to avoid activities that put others at risk or harm but at the same time less prone to engaging in activities that have positive consequences for others. Importantly, we account for the context within which managers make their decisions by examining how situational strength may moderate the influence of mood on managerial ethical decision making. Finally, we discuss how organizations can leverage the double-edged sword effect of mood on ethical decision making and prevent, control and manage the risk of unethical decision making on the part of managers. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Affective states; Behavioral business ethics; Ethical decision making; Mood; Moral intensity; Prescriptive morality; Proscriptive morality",

This study fills this gap, describing a qualitative content analysis of the congruence between six organizations and their various CSR activities. Ten annual reports and CSR reports were analyzed, and 102 specific CSR activities were identified. The results show that two levels of fit must be distinguished: based on the means for and the intended ends of the CSR activity. Furthermore, six different types of fit were found, focusing on (1) products and services, (2) production processes, (3) environmental impact, (4) employees, (5) suppliers, and (6) geographical location.

We investigate conditions under which materialists intend to resist consumption. We find that by enhancing self-control and long-term orientation, the intention to resist consumption and the frugality scores of high- and low-materialism individuals increase. These increases are stronger for those who believe that possessions are a source of happiness, but not for those who believe that possessions signal success or for those who believe that acquiring possessions is a central goal in their daily lives. The findings suggest that individuals who believe that possessions are a source of happiness and who are led to feel more self-controlled and long-term oriented become inclined to resist consumption in the short-term to achieve materialistic aspirations in the long-term. Similar findings were not obtained for the other dimensions of materialism because these dimensions do not motivate one to save in the short-term. Overall, these studies demonstrate that the happiness dimension of materialism may also motivate resistance to consumption.

Because it can be exerted at a distance, almost anytime and anywhere, IT-based control has become more subtle, indirect, and almost invisible, with many negative side effects. Yet the issues raised by this new form of control have rarely been interpreted, treated, and framed as ethical issues in business ethics literature. Thus, a more comprehensive inquiry rooted in ethical concerns is necessary to improve understanding of this more subtle form of control, its ethical consequences, and the way ethical considerations can be taken into consideration and acted on by management. This article addresses this goal with a qualitative, exploratory case study of a telecommunications company, in which salespeople have been equipped with ubiquitous technology. The findings specify the characteristics and consequences of ubiquitous IT-based control, thereby inviting a rethinking of the ethical issues related to the privacy, autonomy, human dignity, and health of salespeople. In particular, this article highlights four ethical issues raised by the use of ubiquitous IT at work: the ambivalence of this use of ubiquitous IT at work, the subtlety of the control exerted by ubiquitous IT, the invasiveness of ubiquitous IT, and the self-reinforcement of ubiquitous IT-based control. Such issues are not often taken into account, suggesting that ethical considerations fail to enter into managerial decision making. This study directly raises questions about the intentions, responsibilities, and divisions across different categories of organizational members who participate in such control systems. It also provides useful insights into employees’ perceptions and offers guidance to managers who want to apply a professional code of ethics to the uses of ubiquitous IT. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Autonomy; Control; Ethics; Information technology; Monitoring, privacy; Stress; Ubiquitous technology",

Collectively, these expectations and needs form a multi-faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management research has largely focused on monitoring as a self-managed set of narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to align with stakeholders' expectations and leverage accountability to stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a model that proposes how firms might address accountability for sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct of sustainable evaluation and verification (SEV) captures three interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality, reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is validated. Also, several antecedents of SEV systems are explored. Finally, the means by which an SEV system can create a competitive advantage are investigated. © 2015 The Authors.","Inclusivity; Monitoring; Social responsibility; Stakeholder engagement","Competition; Monitoring; Supply chain management; Competitive advantage; Extended supply chains; Inclusivity; Social responsibilities; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability issues; Sustainable evaluations; Sustainable supply chains; Economic and social effects"

It emerged as an antidote to the fast-paced imperatives of global capitalism that urge the entrepreneurial self to speed up and work harder to achieve and demonstrate desired social status. The entrepreneurial self can be understood in the contexts of neoliberalism and the class- and gender-based histories of time-thrift and rational recreation; the entrepreneurial self uses leisure time purposively in the pursuit of status, avoids idle pursuits and has restricted capacity to experience leisurely social relationships. In this article, it is argued that leisurely social relations can be reclaimed by letting go, even temporarily, of time-thrift and the compulsion to use leisure time purposively. Data drawn from in-depth interviews with repeat visitors at two Australian caravan parks revealed that for the period of their holiday the tourists relax, refuse to be driven by schedules, socialise with other tourists and feel no compulsion to use time purposively. The key reasons the tourists return to the parks each year were for the friendships and the sense of community they experience as part of the holiday. Slow tourism by its very nature rejects time-thrift, however, as the movement is harnessed by global capitalism, slow tourism risks becoming a source of conspicuous consumption. The findings of this study suggest that friendship and community thrive more readily in conditions where the need to achieve and demonstrate social status is discarded along with time-thrift. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","friendship; holidays; rational recreation; slow tourism; sociability; time sense",

Matten and Moon [Acad Manag Rev 33(2):404–424, 2008] suggested that cross-national differences in firms’ CSR are depicted by an implicit–explicit conceptual framework: explicit CSR practices are deliberate and more strategic than implicit CSR practices. We compared Canada and U.S. CSR and examined how CSR strategic alliances, CSR reporting, and CSR performance in the two countries correspond to implicit versus explicit CSR practices, which we link to stakeholder and signaling perspectives. We relied upon a new database, the Sustainalytics Global Platform (SGP), and we found a positive association exists between CSR strategic alliances and the number of years that firms have issued standalone CSR reports in both countries. Moreover, we found that CSR scores mediated this association in the U.S., as U.S. firms with high CSR scores typically engage in more CSR strategic alliances.

Moreover, family ownership attenuates the positive association between media coverage and corporate philanthropic giving. Our findings are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests and are still valid after controlling for the potential endogeneity between media coverage and corporate philanthropy.

We argue that a crucial reason for this criticism arises from the dominant in-house assumption of CR literature, which mitigates tensions and contradictions in organisational life by claiming that integrated rules result in coupled practices. We aim to provide new insights by problematising this in-house assumption and by examining how members of two organisations discursively make sense of CR, as a daily rule-bound practice, via three strategies: integration, differentiation and fragmentation. We elaborate the contemporary literature on CR as a daily organisational practice by examining the significance of discursive sensemaking for organisational rules for further development and learning regarding CR.

Therefore, this work attempts to provide a stakeholder salience scheme for stakeholder organizations, i.e., organizations with accommodative and proactive stakeholder orientations. In the process, this work reviews key scholarly contributions and points out some potential weaknesses in these contributions with an aim to develop a new stakeholder typology. This work contributes to the existing literature by: introducing a contingent variable, i.e., organizational strategy, in a stakeholder typology scheme; reaffirming the normative aspect of stakeholder theory by placing normative considerations at the center of stakeholder salience typology; and improving the descriptive validity of stakeholder theory by adding a new stakeholder variable, i.e., organization, in the presented stakeholder salience typology scheme. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Stakeholder management; Stakeholder recognition; Stakeholder theory; Stakeholder typology",

This study addresses this question by adopting a multilevel, multistakeholder, and multimethod approach to theorize and estimate the relative influence of macro (national business system and country), meso (industry), and micro (firm-level) factors on CSP. Applying three different methods of variance decomposition analysis to an international sample of 2060 large public companies over a time span of 5 years, our results show that firm-level factors explain the largest proportion of variance in aggregate CSP as well as CSP oriented toward communities, the natural environment, and employees. These results support our hypotheses according to which CSP is not primarily driven by macrolevel or mesolevel factors, except for shareholder-oriented CSP, which is relatively more influenced by country-level factors. As a whole, our findings also point to the value of subdividing CSP into its stakeholder-specific components as this disaggregation allows for a more careful examination of distinct drivers of distinct aspects of CSP. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Decomposition of variance; Hierarchical linear modeling; Stakeholders; Variance components analysis",

It discusses why innovation-based income growth reduces environmental impacts and how the huge global markets for sustainable innovation are currently hampered by protectionist policies. Subsequently, diverse sustainable innovators are presented in ascending order of the complexity of interactions between innovators and stakeholders. In this context, innovating consumers who create communities of peers in solar powered mobility are examined in the first case. It also focuses on regional tacit inventors, who spur innovation in tourism mobility thanks to the informal policies but whose efforts are obstructed by the formalities of the European Union. Artists with an interest in both innovations and the environment develop art services that deliver experiences of environmental qualities. Though these experiences have gone unrecognised so far, they are nonetheless socially beneficial. The book also shows how technology suppliers develop four different patterns of sanitation, each with its own pros and cons for the specific community's needs and conditions. It discusses how project developers also make innovations in office systems, including socially beneficial ones that do away with the need to commute. It includes an analysis of interactions between consumers pursuing ethical consumption and international trailblazers in corporate responsibility and concludes that it is more rewarding to support social entrepreneurs than to attempt to moralise consumers. Further analysis of interactions between sustainable investors and innovators reveals different groups' opinions about policies and markets, helping to explains their weak influence on policies. Mushrooming local energy initiatives are now evolving into energy service companies, producing shifts on energy markets. Why these innovators emerge and how certain policies are blocking them are explained. The policies of the United States and European Union are compared with regard to the main barriers to and drivers of, the renewable energy business. Though the US invests more money and takes more risks, it is less cost-effective in terms of the number of enterprises and jobs, thanks to the feed-in tariffs in Europe. Lastly, the book also discusses policies that invest in education, skills, knowledge and know-how exchange, but instead abolish perverse?? subventions of vested interests to?? create conditions for sustainable development. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

This attention is understandable because large firms have an obligation to shareholders who, as commonly assumed, seek to maximize returns on their investments, in turn, pressing corporate managers to show that firms’ expenditures in social engagement would pay off. Small firms, on the other hand, rarely face such pressures, yet the BCSR logic is increasingly applied to small firms as well. Our primary objective in this paper is to examine whether and how much do small firm owners’ perceptions of BCSR affect the firm’s social engagement. In finding a fine-grained answer to those questions, we consider BCSR as a two-dimensional construct consisting of tangible and intangible benefits, and also integrate the BCSR perspective with the slack resource perspective to offer a motivation-capacity lens to examine firm’s social engagement. Drawing on a multi-industry sample of 478 small firms in the US, we find that while small firm owners’ perceptions about potential tangible benefits of social engagement are not related to the firm’s social engagement, perceptions about potential intangible are positively related. Firm's financial performance is also positively related to its social engagement, but there is no interaction between potential benefits and financial performance. This study contributes to an improved understanding about small firms’ social engagement, which still remains an understudied area. Our results are in line with studies which argue that firms’ social engagement is a response to institutional factors. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Business case; CSR; Slack resources; Small firms; Social engagement; Tangible intangible benefits",

However, it would appear there are currently limited empirical studies carried out in this emerging industry. This case study analyses the cost effectiveness of one such wind turbine initiative by a company in the Republic of Ireland, who invested in a 300 kW embedded wind turbine project at the end of 2013. The research methodology which is primarily a case study analysis included comparing historical electricity utility bills which allowed the 2013 quantity of electrical energy units imported, i.e. the year before the turbine was installed to be compared with the 2014 value, i.e. the year after the turbine was installed. Numerous site visits were undertaken over a four-year period, during which electric meter readings were recorded and stored. The findings of this piece of research indicate that the installation of the embedded wind turbine had minimal positive effect on the annual electricity costs for the company. Indeed the turbine appears to have significant negative effects such as a need for an increased maximum import capacity and also it appeared to contribute to a deteriorating utility power factor. While the aesthetic nature of the on-site turbine seemed to create a positive image of the company, it would appear that caution should be exercised when business owners select alternative energy providers who claim to be experts in the energy field but may have limited knowledge in this area of wind energy, which as of yet has minimal robust research into all aspects of its benefits/attributes. © 2015 The Author(s)","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Embedded generation; Sustainable development; Wind turbine",

To address recent calls for microfoundations of stakeholder theory, we introduce a reconceptualization of stakeholders as social groups to examine how value is defined and interpreted in intergroup processes embedded in an issue-based stakeholder network. We establish a theoretical model of value creation that links individuals’ identification with stakeholder groups to intergroup trust, co-operation, and value creation. Specifically, we argue that the salience of preexisting social identities causes harmful tensions in stakeholder relationships that negatively impact value creation. We then propose that the development of a more inclusive stakeholder identity overcomes these negative intergroup consequences in multistakeholder settings. We discuss the impact on value creation of four stakeholder identity representations based on the salience of specific and superordinate stakeholder groups. The paper concludes with implications of our theoretical model for both research and practice related to value creation in issue-based stakeholder networks. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Social identity theory; Socio-economic issues; Stakeholder identities; Stakeholder networks; Stakeholder theory; Value creation",

However, studies that relate business ethics to corporate brands are either purely conceptual or have been empirically conducted in relation to the field of products/goods. This is surprising because corporate brands are even more relevant in the services sector, due to the different nature of services, and the subsequent need to provide a consistent high-quality customer experience across all the brand–customer interactions and touch-points. Thus, the purpose of this article is to study, at a corporate brand level and in the field of services, the effect of customer perceived ethicality of a brand on brand equity. The model is tested by structural equations, using data collected for eight service categories by means of a panel composed of 2179 customers. The test of measurement equivalence between these categories is conducted using generalizability theory. Confirmatory factor analysis marker technique is applied in order to check for common method variance. The results of the hypothesized model indicate that customer perceived ethicality has a positive, indirect impact on brand equity, through the mediators of brand affect and perceived quality. However, there is no empirical evidence for a direct effect of customer perceived ethicality on brand equity. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Brand equity; Common method variance; Corporate brands; Customer perceived ethicality; Generalizability theory; Services brands",

Despite the ever-growing attention sustainable supply-chain management (SSCM) has received, most SSCM research and models look at the consequences, rather than the antecedents or motives of such responsible practices. The few studies that explore corporate motives have remained largely qualitative, and large-scale empirical analyses are scarce. Drawing on multiple theories and combining supply-chain and business ethics literature, we purport that instrumental, relational, and moral motives are behind a firm’s engagement in SSCM practices. Specifically, we examine the links between corporate motives, SSCM practices, and firm performance. Using a sample of 259 supply-chain firms in Germany, we empirically test five hypothesized relationships. Our results reveal that relational and moral motives are key drivers, and that firms exhibiting high levels of moral obligations tend to outperform those primarily driven by amoral considerations.

Business schools have been deemed largely responsible for developing and teaching socially dysfunctional curricula that, if anything, has served to promote and accelerate the kind of ruthless behavior and lack of self-restraint and social irresponsibility among top executives that have been seen as causing the crisis. As a result, many calls have been made for business schools to accept their responsibilities as social institutions and to work toward becoming more socially embedded and better attuned to public interests. In this paper, however, we point to some of the barriers there may be in the way of business schools developing into responsible organizational citizens proper. We argue that there are lines of resistance against responsibilization operating at epistemological, institutional, and organization levels and that we need to take account of barriers on all these levels in order to properly capture the challenges that are involved in making the modern business school amenable to demands for more social responsibility. In terms of working toward overcoming such barriers, we discuss how business education can become more socially embedded via the inclusion of ethical reflection and critical thinking. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Business ethics; Business schools; Corporate social responsibility; Critical management education; Management education; Management paradigms; Right to operate",

After having explored what I call the “normative presumption of legitimacy” of CPAs, this paper identifies three different plausible strategies to criticize and object to corporate political involvement: the “egalitarian” strategy, the “corporate citizenship” strategy, and the “market failures” strategy. It constitutes an attempt to develop the market failures approach to reflect on CPAs.

We agree with May et al. (2014) that it is essential to augment students’ moral courage. However, it seems overly optimistic to believe that this improvement will result from any course in business ethics. Indeed, we question the appropriateness of their measure of moral courage and assert that business ethics educators must purposely design their courses to develop students’ moral courage. In particular, we advocate introducing business ethics students to works of literature featuring protagonists who exercise moral courage in organizations. Fiction provides rich accessible narratives that show students worlds beyond their experience, awaken their imaginations, and evoke their emotions. Further, we highlight morally courageous exemplars because they inspire the cultivation of character. Joining those who underscore the role of virtue in business ethics education, we argue that exposure to moral exemplars in fiction will help students to build the moral courage they need to carry out ethical decisions in the workplace. Results from 46 students at the end of an MBA ethics course featuring moral courage provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of our approach. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Education/pedagogy/teaching; Emotions; Fiction; Literature; Moral action/behavior/conduct; Moral courage; Moral exemplars",

In doing so, we offer an overview of ethics in entrepreneurship and finance, delineating the curious paucity of research at their intersection. Using twelve vignettes, we put forward the asymmetries between entrepreneurs and investors and discuss a set of ethical problems that arise among key actors centring on the dynamics of venture partner entry and exit, applying the multiple-lens ethical perspective to analyse these issues. This analysis culminates in the introduction of a general classification scheme for ethical problems across venture partners. Our analysis highlights the moral dimension inherent in the entry and exit of venture partners and the importance of considering moral judgement, as well as intention in future analysis of any decision-making. Our study also points to the moral responsibility in finance, especially to the mutual moral responsibilities of investors and entrepreneurs. By integrating ethics into finance, this research also demonstrates that in the case of venture partner exit, an ethical approach and decent governance go beyond compliance to the law. We conclude with implications for practitioners, specifically with some proposals for a solution to the problem of blocked and forced exit. Together, we make several contributions to the literature by integrating ethics, finance and entrepreneurship, and we call for future research to stimulate a growing body of research within this presently overlooked area. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Angel investment; Business ethics; Corporate governance; Entrepreneurship; Exit; Finance; Intention; Stakeholder management; Venture capital; Vignette",

Specifically, scholars note the inadequacy of generic categories of stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers) in providing a realistic portrait of the groups and individuals that interact with the firm, opening the theory to much criticism for a ‘simplistic’ and ‘meaningless’ stakeholder concept. In face of this challenge, recent research is pointing to social identity as a mechanism to refine our understanding of stakeholders as names-and-faces, however we argue that despite the advancements offered by the social identity approach, it too presents limitations in its ability to guide managers in prioritizing stakeholder claims. Building on these nascent efforts to offer much needed nuance to a theory of stakeholder identification and prioritization, this paper draws from new advances in the management literature and offers status as an attribute that helps explain and predict how managers accord attention to their various constituents. We set forth five propositions connecting stakeholder status to the attention stakeholders receive from managers. We argue that status is a superior attribute of stakeholder identification and prioritization because it (1) accounts for groups and individuals’ uniqueness within broad categories of stakeholders in a dynamic way, (2) reconciles the dual nature of stakeholders as holding simultaneously a social and an economic identity in their claim toward the firm, and (3) provides a plausible explanation of, and intuitive guidance to, how managers accord attention to their firm’s stakeholders.

In addition, we need to better understand how social beliefs are linked to ethical perception and the level of analysis at which social beliefs may best predict ethical perceptions. This research contributes to the cross-cultural ethical perception literature by examining the relationship of individual-level social cynicism belief, one of five universally endorsed social beliefs, together with individual social dominance orientation and the perception of unethical behavior. By means of two studies, we examine these relationships across societies that significantly differ on societal-level social cynicism belief. Using 371 business students from Russia and the U.S. in Study 1 and 268 professionals from Portugal and the U.S. in Study 2, we found that individual-level social cynicism belief was positively associated with social dominance orientation. Social dominance orientation, in turn, mediated the relationship between individual social cynicism belief and the perception of unethical behavior. Although we found significant societal-level differences in social cynicism belief in both studies, the relationships between individual-level social cynicism belief, social dominance orientation, and the perception of unethical behavior were structurally equivalent across societies in both studies, suggesting that societal-level differences did not significantly affect these relationships.

One reason may be that approaching the study of gift cards from a traditional economic perspective, i.e. ignoring social relationships, leaves little justification for the rapid increase in gift card sales.

This misses the important point that givers voluntarily buy cards and receivers enjoy gaining them. Consumers undoubtedly perceive the value in gift cards. We suggest that taking a broader perspective on consumer behavior and considering consumers involved in social systems that encourage gift giving, allows us to see the value gift cards create while allowing us to address the concerns gift cards raise more effectively.

Yet, they face sustainability challenges of economic decline, social injustices, and environmental degradation. Urban planning is a critical instrument to cope with these challenges. Visioning, the process of constructing desirable future states, can provide direction for sustainability-oriented planning and decision-making and is increasingly used in this capacity. However, there is ample evidence that urban visions are often not designed along a robust set of sustainability principles. We analyze nine explicitly sustainability-related urban visions from Sweden, Germany, Ireland, Canada, USA, and Australia with respect to their sustainability substance, i.e. in how far they, broadly and in detail, adhere to sustainability principles. Using rough set analysis, we identify a number of procedural components that enable or obstruct the inclusion of sustainability substance in urban visions. Results indicate that the sampled urban visions do not substantially and comprehensively include sustainability substance, instead narrowly focus on optimizing the built environment, for example. Furthermore, the sustainability substance of visioning processes benefits from stakeholder engagement that includes capacity building, whereas some other types of participation obstruct the inclusion of sustainability substance. The study concludes with recommendations for visioning processes to yield urban visions with sustainability substance inclusive of a diverse and integrated set of sustainability principles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Resilience thinking; Rough set analysis; Urban sustainability; Urban visions; Visioning","capacity building; decision making; stakeholder; sustainability; urban area; urban planning; Australia; Canada; Germany; Ireland; Sweden; United States"

Estimating a simultaneous equations model of ramping incidence, spreads, and the probability of deploying real-time surveillance (RTS), we show that quoted bid-ask spreads are positively related to the incidence of MTC across seven liquidity deciles. The magnitude is economically significant; improving market integrity by cutting MTC in half reduces spreads 6–11 %. Allowing direct market access in conjunction with RTS, conducting auctions at the close, and developing regulations that require surveillance, all reduce MTC and thereby lower spreads, assuring better market integrity and enhancing market efficiency.

A systematic review of relevant literature is undertaken which identifies three ontologically based accounts of the relationship between the aesthetic and business ethics: ‘positive’ ones (in which ‘the good is equated with ‘the beautiful’), ‘negative’ accounts (in which aesthetic craving is seen to foster ethical malfeasance) and ‘Postmodern’ renderings (in which the aesthetic and the ethical are seen to be ideologically informed). Five epistemologically based approaches are also made explicit: those in which the aesthetic is thought to develop enhanced perceptual discernment, those in which the aesthetic catalyses emotional sensitivity, those in which the aesthetic contributes to imaginative capacity, those in which the aesthetic prompts integrative apprehension and those in which the aesthetic is seen to foster critical reflexivity. The review reveals two key findings: firstly, the dearth of empirically based research to substantiate claims made about the aesthetic’s ability to foster ethical capabilities, which leads to proposals for further research; secondly, the analysis indicates the significance of critical reflexivity both in resolving the apparent dichotomy between ontologically based perspectives asserting the aesthetic’s ability to lead to ethically sound or egregious behaviour, and in underpinning the capacities of perceptual discernment, emotional connectivity, imagination and integrative apprehension which epistemologically based approaches assert the aesthetic can foster. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Aesthetic sensibility; Aesthetics; Art-based methods; Ethical astuteness; Ethical development",

These reflect, respectively, different accounts of its obligations: either to shareholders or to stakeholders (who include shareholders). Although these opposing constructions of corporate responsibility are diametrically opposed, they are also much more fluid and mobile in certain contexts, since they can act as discursive resources that are deployed and brought into play in the struggle over shaping what responsibility means. They are less the fixed, ideological “signposts” they might appear, and more like “weathervanes” that move alongside changing rhetorical currents. To show this, we analyse the Securities and Exchange Commission consultation process, and legislation, relating to the provenance of “conflict minerals”. We identify two dialectically opposed camps, each seeking to influence final legislation and with end goals in keeping with the shareholder/stakeholder dichotomy. One camp lobbied for firms to scrutinize their entire supply chain, constructing the firm as a “global citizen” with very wide social responsibilities. The second camp lobbied for a lighter touch approach, constructing the firm as a “trader”, with much narrower social responsibilities.

However, there is little empirical evidence to substantiate this assertion regarding adolescence academic cheating across cultures. In this study, we adopt social bonding theory and develop a theoretical model involving four social bonds (parental attachment, academic commitment, peer involvement, and moral values) and adolescence self-reported academic cheating behavior and cheating perception. Based on 913 adolescents (average age = 15.88) in France (n = 429) and China (n = 484), we show that parental attachment, academic commitment, and moral values curb academic cheating; counterintuitively, peer involvement contributes to cheating. We test our theoretical model across culture and gender, separately, using multi-group analyses. For French teens, peer involvement encourages and moral values undermine cheating; for Chinese adolescents, all four social bonds contribute to cheating, similar to the whole sample. For girls, parental attachment deters, but peer involvement enhances cheating. For boys, parental attachment is the only social bond that does not affect cheating. We treat social integration (popularity) as a mediator of the relationship between peer involvement and social bonds that construct, in turn, is related to cheating and ask: Considering popularity, who are likely to cheat? Our answers provide an interesting paradox: Popularity matters, yet popular French girls and unpopular Chinese boys are likely to cheat. Social sharing is a positive pro-social behavior in consumer behavior.

Academic research has explored how varying attributes of markets, industry sectors and firms might shape corporate social and financial performance, but includes little effort to examine the impacts of different kinds of CRA on corporate performance. We build on debate about the value of firms' reporting activities related to corporate responsibility. Recent literature suggests that CRA-R is superficial marketing or ""greenwashing."" Despite this viewpoint, corporate reporting activities related to responsibility are rising. In order to solve this puzzle, this article explores the impact of CRA-R on corporate performance. First, drawing from the institutional perspective, we propose that CRA-R will positively impact corporate social performance (CSP) oriented toward secondary stakeholders. Second, combining the stakeholder-agency perspective and corporate responsibility literature, we motivate the hypotheses that CRA-R positively influences corporate financial performance (CFP). Empirical testing with a unique dataset of large US corporations selected in the Fortune 500 support the proposed hypotheses. In particular, both corporate social responsibility and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) activities positively influence corporate environmental performance, and financial performance. In particular, GRI reporting is a strong indicator to impact both social and financial performance. Our findings indicate that CRA-R should not simply reflect shallow motivations, but deliver value to noninvestor stakeholders as well as investors. © 2015 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

While the economic benefits of this hiring practice for the company are undeniable, many commentators contend that it constitutes wrongful discrimination against unattractive job seekers. In this article, I explore the ethics of A&F-style lookism and challenge two common perspectives on this issue. I argue that on one hand, looks-based hiring cannot be defended based on its economic benefits alone, as race-based hiring also can be profitable in some circumstances. At the same time, I reject arguments that looks-based hiring is not ""job relevant"" given its economic impact in many contexts. Through a comparison between race- and looks-based hiring, I conclude that at least for businesses that are relevantly similar to A&F-firms for which lookism produces clear economic benefits-looks-based hiring is permissible. © 2015 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

On one side it is argued that advisers need only concern themselves with recommendations which meet certain suitability standards. On the other side, there are those who argue the suitability standard is not strong enough to adequately protect investor interests. Instead of ensuring investment recommendations are merely suitable, financial advisers owe their investors a fiduciary duty to ""act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interests ... of the investment adviser providing the advice."" (SEC, 2011). In applying a properly understood conception of what fiduciary means I argue that regulations should not be harmonized but that fiduciary duty should apply to all who provide personalized investment advice to retail customers. I will further argue that even if the regulations are harmonized as proposed, because of exemptions for broker-dealers as envisioned in the proposal, and which currently apply to Registered Investment Advisers, the efficacy of fiduciary duty is diluted to the point of rendering its current application, much less its potential uniform imposition, irrelevant. © 2015 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.",,

Findings also show that firms are less likely to bribe bureaucrats in case financial statements are reviewed by an external audit firm.

We start by discussing why companies have ethical and legal obligations, based on a stakeholder analysis, to assess the integrity of potential employees. We then move to a consideration of how companies currently use background checks as a pre-employment screening tool, noting their limitations. We then take up honesty and integrity testing, focusing particularly on the problems of false positives and due process. We offer a balancing test for the use of honesty and integrity testing that takes in three factors: (1) the potential harm posed by a dishonest employee in a particular job, (2) the linkage between the test and the assessment process, and (3) the accuracy and validity of the honesty and integrity test.

The commonly accepted view of perks suggests that they are a misuse of firm resources for managers’ private benefit (cost view), and thus perk consumption is unethical. However, an alternative view argues that perks can motivate managers to work hard and thus add to the value of the firm (incentive view): from this perspective, perk consumption is an ethical form of behavior. The fundamental difference between the two positions has critical implications for practice, and this article tests these competing views to determine the circumstances in which one view dominates the other. Using hand-collected data on perks in Chinese-listed companies, we find strong empirical support for the incentive view, which is more likely to be held in firms with moderate ownership concentration. This article not only contributes to the literature on business ethics, but also has critical implications for managerial incentive practices in emerging economies. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agency theory; China; Ethics; Incentive; Perks",

Legal aspects were the key drivers of CR, whereas advanced production technology, efficient wood procurement, customer focus, and a competent workforce formed the four principal cornerstones in their pursuit of competitive advantage.
