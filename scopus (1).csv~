In Japan, such change has promoted innovation, but it has also stretched to the limit questions of proper ethical conduct in the pursuit of profit. This article will offer several examples of the ethical challenges facing Japanese business, and recommend a new ethical framework in light of the reforms proposed by and ethical values of Shibusawa Ei'ichi in establishing modem Japanese capitalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.","Business ethics; Corporate governance reform; Globalization; Profit; Social responsibility",

In the past, this conversion has not been efficient or equitable, with benefits accruing mainly to First World investors and consumers by externalization of social and environmental costs to local people and places. Modern industry, led by large multinational corporations, is in the process of changing its modus operandi to embrace ideas of corporate and social responsibility. The damage from past practices to the developing world is severe, however, and may require measures beyond voluntary or current legal instruments to reverse degenerative trends. Central among these requirements is Third World debt cancellation. However, the mining industry can also contribute by fully internalizing the costs of mineral production, and paying a fair price for the resources it extracts; these internalized costs should be reflected in higher commodity prices. This can be achieved through a combination of financial instruments and incentives, innovation, and best practice, with essential consumer buy-in through increased awareness. © The Geological Society of London 2005.",,"mineral resource; sustainable development"

China's apparel production has grown by compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% in the year period 1990-2004, supported by both domestic demand and exports. The growth drivers for the domestic factors are rapid urban population growth, increasing brand awareness, and demand for higher quality products.

This ground-breaking book treats issues, strategies and societal interaction in a homogenous manner and analyzes the nature of the international bargaining society as it has matured. Discussing and contextualizing contemporary debates on international corporate social responsibility, globalization and the impact of reputation, this key text integrates them into a new and coherent framework: Societal Interface Management. Using this unique framework, it explores the interfaces between international corporations, governments and civil society representatives. Analytic and revealing, the text applies the framework to in-depth studies of Nike, Shell, Triumph International, GlaxoSmithKline and ExxonMobil. It investigates the conflicts surrounding Burma, blood diamonds, child labour, oil spills, food safety, patents on HIV/AIDS medication and labour rights that have resulted in a large number of disciplining activities. An accompanying website (www.ib-sm.org) contains additional case studies, as well as issue dossiers on the challenges confronting international firms. Drawing on a wealth of experience both in research and teaching, the authors have developed a text that integrates reputation, responsibility, ethics and accountability. Clearly constructed, it is a must-have book for all those studying or teaching business ethics, political economics, economic geography, public relations, and corporate social responsibility. © 2006 Rob van Tulder, with Alex van der Zwart.

This chapter reviews the efforts within the oil industry (with a particular focus on their operations in the less-developed countries) to develop corporate social responsibility and the related development of voluntary, legal, and statutory programs by governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), civic groups, and multilateral agencies to ensure that the oil industry is compliant with important human, social, political, and environmental rights. In reviewing these developments, I outline the current political economy of the oil industry, new bodies of research on the relations between oil, violence, and human rights violations, which include case studies of the human rights records of transnational and joint-venture oil operations.

Design/methodology/approach - As a generally accepted principle, the corporate social report is a communication and measurement object. But there are limitations concerning availability and accuracy of the data that could create constraints and diminish the scope of this report. Thus, the methodology for this paper is subdivided into two different aspects of research: First, an individual perspective about each enterprise studied and second, a general perspective applied to CSR in Portugal. The sample used was based on the survey developed by the Instituto ETHOS, applied to a sample of enterprises carried out in Portugal, during the year 2002. It was published by Exame in a special edition - ""The guide of socially responsible enterprises"". So, the authors analyze and present the results that are of interest in the area of CSR activity. In order to do so the authors develop a principal component analysis to sort and group the original data. Findings - The preliminary analysis generated three components of CSR: the external influence (CSR external), the market influence (CSR market) and the operative influence (CSR operative) of the enterprises in Portugal. Originality/value - This research shows cultural differences and helps to highlight the importance of more research in this area in the newly expanded European Community. It also highlights the relationship between CSR activity and corporate image and performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Corporate communications; Organizations; Portugal; Social responsibility",

Design/methodology/approach - This paper contributes to the conceptual framework of CSR which asserts that whereas all stakeholders of a company do not have an equal say in its strategic direction, they are affected by such direction, and must hence be considered. Findings - The findings reveal these points: activists are gaining a strong foothold in forcing oil companies to cooperate with their vision of social change; Nigeria lacks legislation compelling oil companies to contribute to the development of their host communities; and although internal oil company documents suggest efforts to help their hosts communities have been made, no meaningful agreement between the oil companies and the indigenous communities have been reached. Research limitations/implications - The paper encourages a broader conception of CSR. Shadow constituents have become such influence wielding stakeholders in organizations today that we need to explore more fully the role they play in dictating public agenda and influencing policy globally.

Brands have traditionally been studied only as an economic construct. Brands, as a social construct, have not yet been fully understood due to the lack of research. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper discusses major issues with references to existing literature and practical examples. Findings - In the conventional brand models the value of brand equity is defined and measured by its economic performance in financial terms. This model has a number of deficiencies. First, two basic elements are missing: legality and ethics, which form the foundation of brand equity. A good brand must be a legal as well as ethical one. Thus brand value needs to be assessed by both financial and ethical measures. Second, conventional brand models focus largely on product brands rather than corporate brands. Brands and branding have such a profound impact on the society as whole and not just on these people who buy them. There is a wider public, in addition to shareholders and consumers, who may be potentially affected by the branding decisions. The impact of branding on these stakeholders should also be taken into consideration. An ethical brand enhances the firm's reputation; such a reputation reinforces the brand in turn. On the other hand, any unethical behaviour will severely damage or even destroy the total intangible asset as evidenced by the recent high profile corporate scandals. Research limitations/implications - The paper questions the conventional branding practice, and explores the links between ethical branding and corporate social responsibility. Many questions remain to be addressed. Practical implications - Ethical branding could provide the company with a differential advantage as a growing number of consumers become more ethically conscious. It could also help overcome the increasing consumers' scepticism and cynicism towards branding communications. Originality/value - The paper is perhaps the first to raise the importance of ethics in branding. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Corporate branding; Corporate image; Ethics; Social responsibility",

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses content analysis of corporate texts and media; interviews with global philanthropy practitioners. Findings - The paper finds that: corporate philanthropy is a reflector of corporate values; global corporate philanthropists have a history of commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities; global companies practice international philanthropy; program delivery differs as a reflection of corporate history, values, mission, and business drivers; global corporations utilize CSR to gain and maintain their ""license to operate""; and corporate cultural learning is pursued as an explicit activity; cross-cultural learning is generally perceived as an implicit outcome. CSR shares values, opportunity for integrated cultural learning. Research limitations/implications - This research is not generalizable. Its findings could be explored by surveying a larger purposive sample. Practical implications - The practical implications of this research are the sharing of corporate values and the inclusion of cultural learning through the integration of CSR activities, including philanthropy.

The question does not lie in understanding if they are really doing a better job of avoiding unethical conduct on a large scale but the question is that do we understand Corporate Social Responsibility requirements for our society? A closer look reveals that in this era of globalization the present day business operations in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world are not as different as many assume. Both have to deal with the misted up explanation of what it means for a company to be ethical and responsible. Given the reality that the multinational corporations yield massive influence in developing countries like Pakistan, India etc, where working in the corporate atmosphere is considered a symbol of class, it is quite appropriate to insist that actions of these capitalist multinationals must be synchronized with the fact of realization of greater responsibility in helping address the rising encumber of basic human needs (yet ignored in South Asia). Objectives: This research is being undertaken to test the proposition that ethics, governance and corporate social responsibility practices of corporations based in the South Asia differ dramatically from corporations based in other parts of the world. The analysis is meant to provide companies in SA with a better understanding of the similarities and differences between the business environments. For any corporation in South Asia following are the important areas in which pondering would instigate after reading this entire article: What is the business rationale for corporate responsibility and how can we set key performance indicators? What is an effective corporate social responsibility for any organization? Who will be the stakeholders involved for defining corporate social responsibility? How will we measure the impact of responsibility initiatives? Scope of Work: This project/research paper will focus (but will not be limited to) on the following issues: I. The changing social trends in South Asia and their correlation with the corporate practices. II. The social factors responsible for decline of productivity in the hi-tech corporate environment and its repercussions. III. Managing these issues so as to reduce the unconstructive effect. IV. The corporate factors responsible for decline of motivation in employees in South Asia and its repercussions. V. Minimizing this effect through better management. VI.

This work attempts to create a framework for social responsibility auditing compatible with an existing commercially successful environmental audit system. The project is unusual in that it tackles the complex issue of CSR auditing with a scientific approach using Grounded Theory. On the evidence discovered to date in the literature review and the interviews, CSR seems to be perceived by many as the social strand of sustainable development. However, there is far less agreement regarding its measurement. Both the literature review and the interview analysis indicate that developing an applied CSR auditing procedure will be a challenging task. This is principally due to the lack of formal study of this complex subject, which, despite the widespread debate it has engendered, still lacks a single and broadly accepted definition. The concepts developed from the findings of this research, together with the key factors identified in a literature review of CSR, were developed into a prospective CSR audit protocol. © Springer 2005.","Audit; Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental and social auditing; Ethical investment; Measurement; Stakeholder management; Sustainable development",

We describe how CSR now extends beyond the traditional 'business case' to encompass new governmental and social drivers.

We examine this question through an analysis of all shareholder proposals introduced from 1969 to 2003 on the topic of international human rights and labor standards, a topic we call Global Corporate Responsibility (GCR). Our analysis demonstrates that religious organizations, activist groups, and universities played an important early role in identifying and raising issues of corporate responsibility and validating the topic for shareholder concern in the early 1970s. We also identify an important role for public pension funds in championing this agenda over time, beginning in the 1980s. When public pension funds supported shareholder proposals on the GCR theme, campaigns attain a level of persistence and success that is more likely to attract the attention of managers. Issues that fail to involve public pension funds exhibit more variable life spans and success rates. Many types of institutional investors played an important role as innovators and supporters in bringing new issues to the foreground of public GCR debate. The support of large pension funds, however, largely determined the success of an issue in consistently garnering the attention of managers.","Corporate social responsibility; Investor activism; Strategic agenda","Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Human rights; Investor activism; Labor standards; Life span; Pension funds; Strategic agenda; Investments; Managers; Shareholders"

These hypotheses are investigated through analysis of Web site reporting of 50 companies in seven Asian countries: India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand. The article concludes that CSR does vary considerably among Asian countries but that this variation is not explained by development but by factors in the respective national business systems.

We propose to treat the normative foundation on the one hand (value) and stakeholders and issues on the other hand (strategy) as two dimensions of CSR that are conceptually independent of each other. We suggest that the CSR engagement of a corporation can be either on value or off value, and that it can be either on strategy or off strategy. Cross-classifying two levels of each of these leads us to consider four CSR prototypes which we label - Robber Baron, Robin Hood, Book Keeper, and Statesman. Those prototypes are shown to exhibit specific characteristics on a set of features. Our framework for categorization of CSR, analysis of featural qualities of each type, and suggested pathways for migration, opens up both construct validity aspects and comparative studies into CSR. Rather than simply developing inventories of CSR activities, and seeking correlations with financial performance measures, it is possible to turn attention to a broad range of independent (i.e., CSR preconditions) as well as dependent (i.e., CSR consequences) variables, and attempt meaningful comparisons to achieve relevant benchmarks. Furthermore, it serves to bridge the gap between CSR scholarship and practice which seem to have evolved in parallel universes.","CSR practice; CSR theory; Managerial framework","Comparative studies; Construct validity; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); CSR practice; CSR theory; Financial performance; Managerial framework; Middle-range theory; Parallel universe; Robin Hood; Two-dimension; Benchmarking; Industry; Economic and social effects"

In addition, theories on the effects of sociodemographic variables on environmental concern have been applied to investigate the influence of individual consumer characteristics on the sensitivity to CSP. It was found that the Consumer Sensitivity Scale to CSP is a reliable one, and it also seems applicable to West European countries. For Dutch consumers, CSP serves more as a hygiene factor - it should be at a minimum acceptable level (a bottom line) - than as a motivator to buy a product. Having a left-wing political orientation, a higher level of education, being female, and being older are consumer characteristics that all have a positive influence on sensitivity to CSP.

While energy prices have increased at a shocking rate, so has interest in environmental responsibility. Progressive organizations are exploring ways to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gases. Some are even creating new positions for these issues, placing someone in charge of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The CSR's job is to help a company be more socially responsible and reduce harmful emissions. Energy management can accomplish both conservation and emission goals- plus, it lowers utility costs and strengthens your bottom line! In the past, reasonably priced energy made it difficult to justify new conservation projects. It was hard to meet the standard criteria of 2-3 years payback. However, natural gas prices have tripled in the last five years from $2 to over $6 per Dekatherm (Dth). Electric prices also have increased dramatically-by more than 100% in some parts of the country. These increased energy costs have made conservation projects more desirable. A natural gas improvement project that had a six-year payback five years ago may have less than a two-year payback today. New technologies also have helped drive down the payback of projects and opened up new areas for potential savings.

These cases are important for the future of holding non-state actors accountable for human rights abuses and for the future of corporate social responsibility (CSR), but positive and measurable impacts are not yet evident in Burma. This is due in part to the irresponsible nature of the Asian corporations that are competing for Burma's resources and in part to the unchanged nature of the military junta, which violates human rights while practising what can be called environmental militarism, i.e. strengthening the armed forces vis-à-vis exploitation and trade of natural resources.

In this framework the task of economists is to design policy instruments to meet human preferences for material commodities as efficiently as possible, that is, with the minimum amount of society's scarce resources. An interesting perspective on this aspect of contemporary economics is offered by anthropologists who trace the origins of economic man back hundreds if not thousands of years. Such a long-term perspective is all the more important since the standard economic preference satisfaction model of consumer and firm behaviour is being replaced by models consistent with current research findings in the fields of psychology, anthropology and other behavioural sciences about human decision-making. Much of traditional management theory and the theory of the firm are based on the preference satisfaction model, so the demise of that conceptual base has far-reaching implications for the analysis of sustainable corporate behaviour.

They have proved to be an effective approach in helping corporations build sufficient understanding of market dynamics, develop and assess different strategies, design and test business capabilities, and, last but not least, improve their human performance. The challenge facing simulation and gaming professionals is to replicate this success within the arena of corporate social responsibility and help corporations, as well as the groups interacting with them, to address the CSR-related challenges in an innovative and effective way. An example of a successful application of simulation and gaming for CSR is a game developed by the Rabo Bank branch office in Bernheze, Netherlands. The bank was facing two issues: (1) How to increase the awareness of what socially responsible entrepreneurship is, both within the bank as well as within the communities the bank is serving, and (2) how to create a vision of how to effectively develop and implement socially responsible entrepreneurship in the local communities; a vision that is not only shared with but acted upon by all relevant actors in that community. With these questions in mind the bank developed a board game called The Game of Profit and Values (Spel van Winst en Waarden) and played it with the employees of the bank, the bank clients (members), members of the local government, representatives of political parties, and representatives of business associations. Based on the experiences and insights created by playing the game, the bank (together with their clients) shaped a vision on socially responsible entrepreneurship in the local communities. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Tokyo.",,

This paper discusses four approaches to securing corporate responsibility to prevent and redress such viola. tions. It first examines the effectiveness of voluntary initiatives based on corporate social responsibility (CSR), but these are found to lack effective implementation mechanisms. Then, the international law regime as it applies to corporations is discussed. Despite conceptual differences about their scope and application, a number of binding human eights and environmental norms do already exist under which corporations can be held to account. These and other evolving norms can be incorporated into national laws, while pursuing a new international treaty as a long-term goal. Third, it considers the adoption of a human rights-based approach and argues that incorporating human rights values, principles, standards, mechanisms and processes in the functioning of the industry could create a win-win situation for communities and corporations. Fourth, aggrieved party initiatives adoptinga legal liability are examined. This paper makes the case for an inclusive approach, employing both voluntary and obligatory initiatives to secure CSR, accountability and, where necessary, legal liability.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR; Environmental law; HRBA; Human rights; Mineral development industry; Voluntary initiatives","accountability; corporate strategy; environmental legislation; human rights; industrial development; international law; minerals industry; Violaceae"

The effectiveness with which corporations perform this function determines their contribution (or lack of contribution) to social cohesion. This article therefore presents a discussion of some of the social cohesion issues involving corporations, particularly concerns over how corporations make profits, create jobs, hire, promote, fire, treat shareholders, run their boards, and give back to the communities in which they function. Most of these functions depend on the quality of corporate governance, which in turn has implications for social cohesion. The article begins with a discussion of the concept of CSR. Then it presents an identification and discussion of some corporate behaviors that promote CSR in the following areas: governance; employment practices; and involvement in communities, environmental protection, and ethical investment. In conclusion, successful business strategy that contributes to social cohesion in society is that which fosters integrity in internal governance while promoting positive engagement in communities in which corporations operate.

Milton Friedman argued that because managers are agents of the company's owners, their sole moral responsibility is to maximize owner returns. Thomas Pogge has recently suggested that such a view involves a kind of moral incoherence and that we should reject the efficacy of social arrangements like the principal-agent relationship in altering moral obligations. Both views fail to give proper account of the dispersal of moral responsibilities in business contexts. We must distinguish ""minimal moral obligations"" (stemming from justice and rights) from ""maximal moral obligations"" (stemming from all other moral considerations, including duties of aid, beneficence, and the virtues). Minimal obligations apply to all persons, but maximal obligations can be effected by social arrangements like the ownermanager relationship. There may be moral obligations incumbent on owners that do not apply to managers. Understanding this distribution of responsibilities enables us to develop a new and attractive model of business ethics - ""the ownership model"" - which places greater emphasis on the rights and responsibilities of the owners of business than has been traditional in business ethics. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.","Beneficence; Business ethics; Charity; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Ethical investment; Justice; Milton Friedman; Responsibility; Rights; Shareholder value theory; Stakeholder theory; Thomas Pogge; Virtue",

It does so by drawing, in the first instance, on an example of apparent good corporate social responsibility and exposing the possibly unethical dimensions of the incident. The paper suggests that corporate governance always has a subjective ethical dimension and that such regimes are best understood as 'regimes of practice' - actions, actors and discourses - that shape and mould both thinking and action. Such regimes, it is posited, can best be explored by looking at actual instances or events of significance and analysing these. The paper then offers the example of international pharmaceutical companies' HIV/AIDS drugs pricing policies, especially in South Africa, as such a critical incident and interrogates it using the 'analytics' approach outlined by Dean (1999).

It begins with the influential role that agency theory has played both in the conception and reform of corporate governance. Its grounding assumption of self-interested opportunism leaves little or no room for ethics beyond what pays. This conception is then contrasted with a Foucauldian view of governance in which ethics is explored in terms of how an 'ethic' of shareholder value has been promulgated in the last decade. The third section of the paper explores the contemporaneous explosion of interest in corporate ethics and social responsibility and suggests that there is a nascent disciplinary regime being assembled which may redefine the terms of shareholder value to include environmental and social performance. What is paradoxical about both an ethics of shareholder value and corporate responsibility is that they are effective only through creating a preoccupation with the self and how the self is seen, rather than the other. The final concluding part of the paper suggests that ethics, following Levinas, should be understood in terms of sentience and the 'responsibility for my neighbour' that this assigns. Such a view of ethics refutes the individualism that agency theory takes as the essence of human nature, and Foucauldian analysis suggests is the product of disciplinary processes. Its grounding in sentience and proximity however offer it only a local role in corporate governance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,

That works of art can be recognized as aligned with a company's identity has important implications for companies that use reproductions of works of art to decorate their walls insofar as customers may take the art as a symbol of the company's identity. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.","Corporate art collections; Corporate communication; Corporate identity; Corporate image; Corporate social responsibility",

The idea of CSR presupposes some forms of bounded social world within which the allocation, the distribution of economic resources and the determination of the scale of corporate business activities come into existence. According to this, the corporative context is partly non-functional and resorts to the intrinsic motivation of the agents and to the responsibility of people who manage the corporations (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Barclay & Smith, 2003; Birch, 2003; Greenfield, 2004; Manokha, 2004). It is to be mentioned that some theoreticians are sceptical about CSR as the blanket term and corporation-as-person theory. The CSR advocates argue that on the basis of managing social and environmental issues, companies will perform better financially with less risk in the long run. As the recent corporations-related meltdown events have demonstrated, the management systems, per se, offer no assurance of improved ethical performance. It is necessary to articulate the aspects of CSR in the light of the common ground of the existing market society. When corporations praise the free market, they often (too often, actually) mean freedom from having to subordinate the use of property to external value. The market power of the corporations serves as a means of escaping from market's freedom of entry condition; consequently, market power of corporations is the means to unmake the entry to market on the basis of industrial protection and intellectual poverty (Kingston, 2000). Many firms have adopted some of the relevant CSR management techniques, but there is a lack of information on whether or not social and environmental performance has, in reality, been altered. CSR gets relevance only through a systematic approach defining the changes needed to make business responsible and sustainable. The CSR discourse is legitimised if it proves to be an impetus for the rethinking of the structure of the contemporary market society and the massive rents of corporations, i.e. the structural tendencies of the non-responsible property rights in the context of the ""race to the bottom"". One potential path of interpretation is to differentiate the features of responsibility in connection to the diverse components (economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary or philanthropic). Also, there is corporate social responsibility, at the institutional, organisational, and individual levels. At the organisational level, CSR addresses public responsibility in that businesses are responsible for outcomes related to their embeddedness within society. In addition, at the individual level, the principle of managerial discretion states that managers are moral actors. Within every field of corporate social responsibility, they are obliged to exercise such discretion as is available to them, toward socially responsible outcomes. This principle is not limited to corporate philanthropy or community involvement, but covers the entire area of managerial actions. It is very important to accentuate this principle in the case of Serbia, in fact, in Serbian corporate law the manager is a leader in the strong sense. In addition, this position of manager is in line with the earlier tradition. Without any exaggeration we could say that his/her discretion power and impact on the corporation practice is enormous. Accordingly, any reflection on the corporate responsibility in Serbia should begin with the elucidation of the manager's responsibility in relation to the social embeddedness of the corporation. In order to avoid the empty normativity it is always indispensable to interpret the apparent contextual dimensions of CSR that are to be detected as the starting point of further reconsideration. Above all my interpretation stresses the ambiguous character of the meaning of CSR in Serbia. This article covers matters as diverse as law and government, corruption-practices, war, and so on. Some trends are simply ignored and others dealt with rather summarily. The purpose is to shed light on the complex social processes in and through which specific institutional orders and their broader social preconditions are structured in Serbia.",,

What changed then was not so much the attention paid to social and environmental issues, because this had been a tradition for many years. Rather it was the way in which companies developed their individual visions and ideals to incorporate this theme and went beyond mere compliance with regulation. In addition, companies needed to communicate more openly than before about their performance with their employees and with the diverse stakeholders. The main driver of corporate social responsibility in the Netherlands was the clear change in positions between enterprises, government and citizens. Complementing this development was a rise in social responsibility, within the framework of the civil society. In order to underpin this explanation, a brief overview will be presented of the historical roots of corporate social responsibility. Next, it will be explained which events triggered the development of corporate social responsibility in the Netherlands and which actors are presently involved.

In this building and starting up process, political and business leaders as well as society were neither ready to think about the issues of ethical business or corporate social responsibility, nor did they consider the importance of these topics in their action. It is true that over the last 10 to 13 years, after restoring the countrys independence, Estonias development has been relatively successful compared to other transition countries. But at the same time it seems that we have forgotten ethics and ethical behaviour, caring for others and taking responsibility, which is creating many problems on personal, organisational and societal levels. Today, more and more people in Estonia realise that in order to be recognised as an equal partner and competitor in the globalising world, we need to make important strategic decisions and changes, which will guarantee us a strong society, conscious citizens, administrative responsibility, defined national interests, protection of these interests and local high-level competence in the key areas, etc. The pressure from society and the media for discussing these issues is perceptible and it is quite obvious that corporate social responsibility is gaining importance also in Estonia. As business ethics and CSR are relatively new concepts in Estonia and companies are only starting to implement the ethical and CSR processes, there is not much research being done in the field. Some research focuses on ethical decision-making and ethical leadership and other related topics revealing how the attitudes towards ethics and CSR have changed and how the businesses and organisations see their responsibilities towards society and the environment today.",,

By its very nature CSR is a complex, multi-faceted phenomenon arising at the interface of business and society. Moreover, the issues covered by the CSR agenda raise important questions about the role and responsibilities of business and the capacity of managers and companies to respond to the challenge of those new roles and responsibilities. The perspective taken in this paper is that CSR involves companies in organisational change as they learn ways to interact with new and enlarged sets of stakeholders and develop responses to their concerns, pressures and expectations. CSR can be seen to involve generic as well as context-specific aspects. Generic aspects of CSR centre on the notion that the adoption of new roles and responsibilities demands a process of organisational change and the development of routines to manage those demands. This process implies a need to appreciate the demands and pressures on the organisations, to acknowledge, make sense of, and prioritise the areas for change, and, gain the commitment of members of the organisation to that process and the new ways of thinking and routines it demands. This in turn requires the direction of change to be signalled and communicated through some statement of vision of what the organisation needs to become, and, to prepare for that change through a strategy or plan which sets targets, allocates resources, provides for the managerial and organisational competence and sets in motion a process to move the organisation and its members toward the chosen vision. This strategy is then implemented through action programmes, which are supported by a system to monitor and review progress toward specific targets and the broader vision as a basis for the development of new plans and/or to review the vision itself. These aspects of CSR as organisational change are not held to be controversial. Identification of the elements of a vision, making commitment and gaining commitment of others, formulating and implementing a strategy leading to performance on CSR issues (and other unintended out comes) that feed into a cycle of review and reflection is well established in business.The source of fascination (and frustration) for researchers and managers stems less from the elements of this generic model and more from the specific issues in managing CSR as organisational change. These issues focus around questions such as: 1. How does the practice of CSR differ from the generic model outlined above? 2. What processes for stakeholder engagement are effective? 3. What institutional and other factors influence the adoption of CSR practices by companies? 4. What processes are effective in gaining commitment to CSR as organisational change? 5. Why do some organisations effect change better than others? 6. How do managers make sense of, rationalise, or develop a business case for CSR? 7. What capabilities and competencies support organisational performance in CSR? 8. How do companies integrate CSR with mainstream business practices? 9. How are choices made when there are conflicts between CSR issues and more conventional business choices? Although these questions about the rationale, process and repertoires of CSR are critically important for research, policy and practice the purpose of this paper is to address more basic context-specific issues. To this end the paper explores what constitutes the overall field or agenda of CSR and how far this agenda and the response it elicits from companies, is shaped by national culture and institutions as norms, values, customs and rules. It is proposed that this most basic line of inquiry is a cornerstone to understanding the phenomenon of CSR and its managerial, organisational and social implications in a pan-European or international context. Indeed, the paper addresses two intersecting themes of this book. The first is the great variety of issues, managerial choice and practices, which defines corporate social responsibility (CSR) in European firms. The second is the extent to which it is possible to detect patterns in the issues of and approaches to CSR in Europe and how far these are accounted for by the national (cultural and institutional) origins of firms and their senior managers. While CSR practice reflects the fact that companies are assuming new roles and responsibilities, when viewed from a European perspective, the CSR agenda contains a wide set of issues. This is not a trivial issue. CSR is a complex, dynamic agenda. It has so many different dimensions that no company can claim mastery of these issues, making it an extremely difficult phenomenon to research. With this background the paper is structured in three sections. The first section reviews different perspectives on CSR and how they relate to notions such as the socially, environmentally and financially sustainable enterprise. This section seeks to demarcate the overarching agenda of CSR issues. The second section reviews the factors that influence this agenda and how these issues appear to translate in to company practices in different European countries. The paper concludes with acall for the development of a research framework for empirical comparative research that provides a basis to measure and compare CSR practices within European firms.",,

Industrial districts and small firms have often engaged in sustainable forms of conducting business through the convergence of employees, management and local community interests (Confindustria, 2002). Also in academia the concept of the social role of business was pioneered during the 1950s: ""Profit doesnt represent the final end of the firm, but is instrumental for satisfying the needs of shareholders and workers"" (Masini, 1979). In order to understand the social and economic context in which a first phase of socially responsible initiatives emerged especially in the post-war period and to better contextualize the more systematic and widespread current CSR approach, a historical background of Italys socio-economic situation is provided. After the Second World War Italy found itself in a dramatic situation: the country had to recover from war destruction and start living within a new political context, thus passing from monarchy to democracy. At the beginning of the 1950s Italy was still an underdeveloped country, mostly agricultural. 36% of labour forces were employed in agricultural sectors; industrial sectors employed another 32%. In 2003, according to Istat1 data, 4.8% of labour forces were employed in the agricultural sector, 31.8% were employed in the industrial sector and 63.8 % in the services sectors and others. On one side this shift in employment percentage (from a higher employment in the agricultural sector to service and industrial sectors) shows that Italy, during the last sixty years, has undertaken a major economic development. On the other side, the high rate of development has affected more northern areas than southern ones. The higher percentage of Italian family income is still concentrated in the northern regions (53 %), while 26% of family income can be found in southern areas and 21 % in the central areas. Italy is a country characterised by a huge gap between North and South since the beginning of the previous century. This gap has historical roots which can be found in the southern agricultural frame where wide properties were concentrated among a small amount of owners; an underdeveloped agricultural commerce where very few products reached external markets and most products were produced for internal demand. This situation was very different from northern Italy, whose development was tied to northern European countries. Being close to these important markets gave the opportunity for rapidly growing trade and wealth accumulation. The income gap associated with wider job opportunities, caused more than four million people to emigrate from southern Italy to North Italy between 1951 and 1974. According to Istat (2003) data, the emigration flow, which had slightly diminished during the first years of the 1990s, started again between 1994 and 2000. 30% of Italian families transferred from the southern regions to the North-Eastern areas and Central Italy.",,

Ukraine has not experienced an institutionalisation of the CSR movement. In fact there is no CSR movement as such but rather the existence of socially conscious managers. A national framework for corporate citizenship has not been developed and no business or multi-stakeholder fora on the topic have been established. Rather than focusing on an assessment of CSR as an institutionalised approach, this paper endeavours to provide a background and to highlight factors, which arguably will be crucial for the inception of CSR in Ukraine.",,

Many social economic processes, which are peculiar to most Western countries, are just evolving here. Though private business, a free market and all features of modern enterprises testify to the progress of Lithuania, many global initiatives and advanced social innovations are rather late in arriving here. The idea of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has not emerged in Lithuanian public discourse yet. It is still a new paradigm of social economical development. In the country where the civic society has not fully formed, there is no clear comprehension of the idea of business social responsibility and most companies do not actively express readiness to meet the expectations of society. On the other hand, the expectations of various social groups towards business are just forming and are not properly articulated. The communitys expectations of business enterprises are often reduced to the creation of new workplaces. In turn, companies regard all social problems (unemployment, social security, healthcare etc.) as entirely a concern and responsibility only of the Ministry of Social Security and Labour. Their understanding of responsibility is bound to the creation of jobs for the community and tax payment to the state. In many cases philanthropy is emphasised as the essence of CSR. Some elements of CSR can be traced in management practices of certain companies. However, CSR issues are not officially put on the public agenda in all their completeness. Ethical issues and social consequences of companies downsizing, hiring and dismissal practices, career planning are still not considered. Though certain forms of discrimination (e.g. on the basis of sex, age, ethnic origin, etc.) are discussed in the public arena, they are not reflected in companies policies and the necessity to reflect these issues has not reached them yet. Taken as a definite quality option of business activity, CSR constitutes a process of ""achieving commercial success in ways that honour ethical values and respect people, communities, and the natural environment"" (www.bsr.org). To a great extent CSR can be regarded as a substantial parameter of business performance and an efficient means for economics humanisation and sustainable development. It can be practically realised through the tools provided by business ethics (ethics programmes, codes of conduct, ethics officers, ethics committees/commissions, social audits, round tables, ""hotlines"", etc.). Its constructive, rational and goaloriented options in aggregate with enhanced moral competence and ethical sensitivity enable companies to implement CSR principles and establish them as an indispensable and advanced remedy for performance improvement, as an essential contribution to sustainable development.",,

Even the sceptical Martin Wolff, Chief Economics Correspondent of the Financial Times commented that ""CSR is an idea whose time has come"" (Wolff, 2002: 62). CSR is a cluster concept which overlaps with such concepts as business ethics, corporate philanthropy, corporate citizenship, sustainability and environmental responsibility. It is a dynamic and contestable concept that is embedded in each social, political, economic and institutional context. Notwithstanding this recent flurry of CSR activity in Europe, business social responsibility was traditionally regarded in Europe as a peculiarly American phenomenon, reflecting American traditions of participation, self-help and small or at least indirect government. There is, however, no evidence that those taking a comparative view of business-society relations on either side of the north Atlantic over the twentieth century would necessarily argue, by virtue of the relative low salience of CSR in Europe, that its businesses were socially irresponsible. Indeed there is evidence to the contrary. Vogel concluded that UK business is ""more susceptible to social pressure both from government officials and from other forums to behave 'responsibly'"" (1986: 50). This raises broad questions about the changing nature of, and the reasons, for European corporate social responsibility. In particular it raises a conceptual paradox: was it possible for business in Europe to be socially responsible in the absence of a language of CSR in Europe. And, to what extent does the recent adoption of a language of CSR in Europe reflect a fashion in management, or something genuinely new in the European corporate landscape. We reserve the term ""genuinely new"" to describe a situation in which the advent of modern CSR implies a previous disregard by corporations in Europe to live up to a set of responsibilities towards society, however defined. Our argument developed in this chapter is that CSR in Europe, as defined by the majority of recent academic writings and corporate publications, is only ""new"" in the sense that it represents an innovation in corporate policies. While we would maintain that there is a long tradition of business involvement in many of the issues associated with modern CSR. These have been tackled by corporations in Europe for most of the last century (in some cases even longer). However, this company-social engagement was understood, articulated and performed in different ways.1 We seek to reconcile this contradiction by proposing a distinction between ""explicit"" and ""implicit"" CSR. We conceptualise CSR as a way of thinking and a set of practices enacted and addressed by - mostly voluntary - corporate policies, which explicitly circumscribe the responsibilities towards society, which corporations seek to address. On the other hand, the majority of issues which count as corporate responsibilities towards society in a European context are not part of the corporation's explicit policies but they are implicitly codified in the norms, standards and legal framework of Europe and its nations. We use the distinction between explicit and implicit CSR to make sense of: 1. the rise and role of the new CSR in Europe, and 2. the way this approach to CSR interacts with deeply embedded national institutional contexts as CSR transforms from an implicit to an explicit form; and 3. the contextualisation of CSR in different national cultures, particularly those without a history of the Anglo-Saxon system of capitalism. As background, we recognise that twentieth century Europe has experienced a wide range of political and economic systems including systems in which business motivated by profit and open and democratic forms of civil society have been suppressed; those with no independent business sector; those where corruption and irresponsibility flourished. However, we would argue that there are certain similarities between European countries, which manifest themselves in the way CSR is understood and practised and that this understanding is different from, for instance, the USA. We also acknowledge that there are still significant differences among European countries and that most of our thinking is informed by the experiences of CSR in west and north European countries and only to a lesser degree Central and Eastern Europe. The first group of countries have enjoyed extended periods of liberalism, democracy and regulated capitalism in a mixed economy and which, all things being equal, we would expect to resemble American business-society relations.2 Secondly, we recognise that some features of American societal governance have similarity with features of the European model. Indeedin some cases the USA pioneered regulation for social responsibility (e.g. the postcivil war pensions and public sector employment, the New Deal, the regulatory work of the Environmental Protection Agency in the 1960s).",,

Since the 1980s, citizenship theories have predominated in academic literature and ""two types of experiments with citizenship are emerging: those concerned with the extension of the market, that is the re-expression of market freedoms as integral to, rather than in conflict with, citizenship; and those concerned with trying to transcend formal political patterns with more social and participative approaches"" (Crouch, Eder & Tambini, 2001: 8). In the context of these theoretical debates and more specifically, adhering to the theoretical strand of the experimentation with ""market extension"", we define corporate citizenship as a political commitment undertaken by corporations towards the global society and local and international stakeholders in order to address pressing social and environmental issues. We regard CSR as a major driver of corporate culture change, in an era where corporate reputation, competitiveness, leadership and risk management are increasingly embedded in corporate social and environmental performance. The notion of CSR is also directly linked with the concepts of civil society and stakeholder capitalism (Kelly, Kelly & Gamble, 1997; Kay, 1997; Hutton, 1999) since it establishes a new business model for the 21st century, the Corporate Citizen (McIntosh, Leipziger, Jones & Coleman, 1998; Janoski, 1998). In Greece CSR is a new concept, almost a neologism, that has gained impetus over the past three years amongst business leaders, opinion makers, media professionals and government. Academic research on the issue is taking its first steps, focusing on the changing role of business in society (Lipovetski, 1992; Bovens, 1998) and the new model of ""citizen brands"" that integrate corporate citizenship, core values and branding (Willmott, 2001: 5). Other areas of research include ethical consumption, stakeholder theory and cross-sector partnerships, the impact of CSR policies and communication on corporate reputation, and the medias CSR. Public opinion surveys map the changing perceptions and social expectations, fostering our hypothesis that the CSR movement can also be a driver of social change in its own right. On the other hand, our political tradition favours conflict and social confrontation and rarely does it value structured dialogue, cooperation or partnership building among social partners and stakeholders. Nevertheless, during the elections of 8th March 2004, the concepts of ""dialogue"", ""transparency"", ""responsibility"", ""participatory democracy"", and ""cooperation"" were introduced into our mainstream political agenda, signalling the eve of a new era where the concept of corporate social responsibility can be embedded in the emergent socio-political values.",,

In a similar way to the Austrian Strategy on Sustainable Development (Federal Austrian Government, 2002), the Austrian CSR activities build upon the long-lasting Austrian tradition of broad stakeholder involvement within the so called ""social partnership"". This is the common dialogue platform between the main social partners. In the 1990s Austrian companies learned to deal with the terms environmental and social friendliness and finally with the term ""sustainability"". Enterprises nowadays begin to include this visionary concept in their own goals and business philosophy. Moreover they are starting to implement the sustainability concept in their management strategies and tools and communicate this through sustainability reporting and open stakeholder dialogue. The broader CSR discussion arose in Austria only recently. Due to the ongoing awareness process and due to many ""mosaic stones"" formulated during the last few years concerning corporate citizenship, corporate governance and business ethics, it was easy to introduce the CSR discussion. The time was right when the ""CSR Austria Initiative"" was formed by the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Labour and key industrial players in 2002.

Apart from this, some companies also assumed a certain paternalism towards their workers in matters such as housing, food, grants for children's studies, etc. After the Spanish civil war (1936 - 1939), Spain was under General Franco's authoritarian regime up to 1975. Democracy arrived with a new Constitution in 1978, which established a parliamentary monarchy system. In the post-war era, an autarchic economic system came into play, which was liberalised from 1959, opening the Spanish economy to external markets. In the sixties, sensible economic development began. During Franco's time many regulations protecting workers from dismissal were promulgated and a wide social security system was developed. However, as in many other countries, there were scarce regulations in matters such as consumerism, the environment and fair competition. The hidden economy and tax evasion were relatively pervasive. Lack of democracy was frequently offered as a pretext for tax evasion, but the cause was probably more complex, since this problem has persisted up to now, although currently an efficient monitoring and a relatively rigid inspection system has been introduced, and tax fraud has reduced considerably. Since the 1940s Spain has had numerous nationalised companies and seen many regulations and state interventions in the economy. A mixed economy persisted after economic liberalisation. A new boost to the Spanish economy took place in 1986, when Spain became a member of the European Economic Community. In the 1980s and above all in the 1990s, most state companies were privatised, as happened in other West European economies. A great number of big companies is now operating in Spain as a consequence of these privatisations, as well as of mergers and acquisitions and the establishment or consolidation of well-known transnational companies. Since the 1990s a great number of Spanish companies have expanded their business to Latin America and, significantly less commonly, other industries have set up business in Morocco, Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Now large companies of financial services, energy and telecommunications are well-established in Latin America. Throughout the 20th century many business, especially the largest, assumed their responsibilities to some extent, implementing policies and practices related to this topic. In Spain, as in other countries, two waves can be distinguished regarding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The first, which was rather weak, was in the 1970s, and the second at the beginning of the 21st century1. Since then a renewed interest in CSR has arisen in Europe and worldwide (Fernández, 2004). With respect to business directors and managers, we might generally affirm that Spain has definitely developed a better image of them, along with ample social acceptance, instead of a certain mistrust and even rejection in the past. Spanish capitalism has thus stopped being oligarchic and has advanced towards a popular form of it. As proof we may look at Spain's growing number of stockholders and the increasing importance of the Spanish stock exchanges in the last eight or ten years. Still, a lot remains to be done in the areas of corporate governance and the exercise of power in the large corporations. Like their counterparts in the developed world, Spanish companies have on their agenda the challenge of Corporate Social Responsibility and what it means for management, internal structuring and interaction with society. Up to now, there have not been many studies on the situation of CSR in Spain. An exception is the work of de la Cuesta and Valor (2003), who, among other things, present measurement systems and some observations on the development of CSR in Spain. In addition, some limited surveys on CSR in Spain have been carried out by Forética (2002) including 398 companies and PriceWaterhouseCoopers (2003) including 43 companies (most of them quite sensible with sustainability and CSR). Also worthy of note is the annual report on activities related to CSR in Spain which the Fundación Ecología y Desarrollo began to publish a few years ago. All of these works can be considered as exploratory studies, while a research in depth on CSR in Spain is still to be made; something that this paper will not attempt. Its purpose is only to give an overview of the current situation of CSR in Spain, paying particular attention to the cultural factors and driving forces for CSR and major documents, milestones and institutions in its development. A summary of the current situation in academia and in business, and future trends, will also be provided.",,

To some extent, this is a matter of discrepancy between words and deeds. This article, however, focuses on another, more fundamental difficulty. The obstacle, facing attempts to turn the moral impulse behind corporate social responsibility into a plausible result, arises from fundamental clashes between the fundamental principles that drive the institutions designed to protect certain fundamental rights and the fundamental principles that fix the norms of performance for commercial life. To assess whether the conflict is irreconcilable, the problem needs to be seen in terms of the divergent ways in which adequate respect for and protection of those rights and obligations is understood. Certain resolutions of competition among fundamental rights - based on ""functional"" or ""consensual"" justification - can carry hidden bias, while others - based on ""civic"" justification - might allow the full potential, of such rights to be realised. The test for compatibility between human rights and the economy is therefore whether economic imperatives can integrate the demands of civic justification. © UNESCO 2005.",,"human rights; industrial enterprise; morality"

It looks at the origin of the trade union inability to deal with the movement of capital that recaptured 'labour' in the global garment industry, by tracing labour's reaction to the movement of capital emerging around protectionism in the 1960s, all the way to the debates around the 2004 Multi-Fibre Arrangement. This is followed by a critical review of the international consumer campaign and the corporate reaction that saw the introduction of company Codes of Conduct and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) that challenged the international solidarity-building undertaken by the trade union movement. We draw on examples from the consumer campaign in the garment industry to argue these new campaigns take an individualistic approach to capitalist social relation and risk creating new divisions of labour, while reinforcing older one. Moreover, they risk driving the labour movement towards increased dependence on transnational capital for protection, The conclusion is that building a new labour solidarity is possible for the labour movement only if it is engaged in organizing from the 'bottom-up', both inside and outside factories, in developing as well as developed countries, rather than taking a top-down approach based on the market power of developed countries or the institutionalized leverage of international trade unions.",,"garment industry; international trade; labor; trade union"

It traces how African labor, particularly women's labor, has been harnessed and restructured by three models of development: (1) the neo-liberal prescriptions for agricultural diversification and contract farming; (2) the post-Washington consensus of pro-poor growth; and (3) the Corporate Social Responsibility movement of the late 20th century. While each model offers different approaches to improving Kenyan lives, they are united by a common intent to bring African labor into the fold of modernity, as both object and instrument of development. Drawing on fieldwork conducted among smallholders and waged employees, the article advances two arguments: (1) the construction and outcome of horticulture development is founded on, and contingent upon, gendered forms of labor; and (2) the exercise of trusteeship has been central to each model as international financial agencies and non-governmental organizations steward the 'development' of the African laborer. The article contends that all models cast the Kenyan worker as someone to be developed, be it through rural development, integration into a global workforce, or incorporation into a universal system of social justice. © 2005 SAGE Publications.","Development practice; Gender; Horticulture; Kenya; Labor","agricultural trade; agricultural worker; gender relations; horticulture; Africa; East Africa; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa"

Design/methodology/approach - Capabilities theory is used as an analytical lens to evaluate the nature of interaction between the senior women's ""internal capabilities"" (their readiness to act), and the external ""work environment"" (work and non-work factors) that in combination with internal capabilities, constitute combined capabilities. In particular, we reflect on how the character of combined capabilities might effect senior women's perception of ambition and risk and the choices that are made during the ""career journey"". Findings - From a capabilities perspective, it can be argued that the remit of HRM policy makers regarding the careers of women attempting to break through the glass ceiling needs to be broadened, particularly by those organisations not only wishing to enhance their corporate social responsibility with regards to existing and potential employees but also those wishing to deepen their understanding of workplace inequality. Originality/value - This paper adds to our understanding of women's career journeys, and is likely to be of interest also to those researching the in areas of workplace equality and diversity and HRM policy and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Careers; Glass ceilings; Women executives",

This process is greatly facilitated by advertising. Advertising not only provides information for the consumers but may also be used by the advertiser to bring subconscious consumer preferences or inchoate desires to the surface and to stimulate the demand for consumption. In carrying out these tasks, the advertiser must decide the pitch of the advertisement, the appropriate media to be used, the budget, the degree of exposure of the advertisement, market segmentation and claims to be made for the product (Goldring et al, 1987). Australian firms, irrespective of their size, rely heavily on advertising to market their products and services. The degree to which firms see the crucial role of advertising in their overall marketing mix, is clearly reflected in their annual allocation of advertising expenditure. ""In 1997, total Australian advertising expenditures were $ 7.5 billion on advertising"" (Miller and Layton, 2000, p.590) All creative and imaginative forms of enticements and inducements being considered in the development of advertising strategies by these firms in an attempt to evoke favourable consumers' responses for their offerings. Over time, some firms have come under increasing criticism by some sections of the community for their inappropriate promotional strategies which are seen as out of step with general community values and standards. Further in some instances, it is alleged that these firms have not only miscarried their social responsibility, but they have also breached the law covering Trade Practices operative in Australia and New Zealand. Such misguided corporate behaviour has also sparked negative consumerism concern, which if no corrective measure is adopted, will strategically harm the firm profit and viability. This research paper attempts to explore in some detail, aspects of advertising strategies within contemporary management paradigm. The paper will also shed light on corporate ethics /social responsibility. Finally, this paper will address legal obligations and consumerism concerns surrounding firms operating within the Australian society.","Advertising; Business Ethics; Consumerism; Environment; Law; Promotions",

In evaluating a company, many analysts now consider the financial risks and rewards associated with climate change and examine the corporate response to climate change at various levels of governance. Since such evaluation depends on good information, three efforts to increase transparency on climate change are described. Further, through dialog and shareholder resolutions, social investment analysts have impressed on company management their concern for climate change as a corporate responsibility. Enhanced sensitivity to the interplay between social, environmental, and financial factors has allowed socially responsible investment analysts to earlier understand the potential risk implications of climate change. Risk to companies may take the form of direct impact from extreme weather events and climate shift: damage to physical assets, increased insurance claims, or loss of core business. Companies that make a point of qualifying reductions for trading credit could reap financial benefits, as could companies that focus on cost savings tied to strong energy management. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) seeks to encourage companies around the world to use a standard framework for reporting on sustainability issues.

Although there are several reasons for companies to apply environmentally sustainable business practices, the most enticing are economic. Like a pendulum, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 responded to a full left swing of potential major disasters and brought the weight to the far right. These regulations established requirements for the response equipment/personnel needed in the event of a worst-case discharge. Also due to the significant efforts of established pollution prevention regulations, the past decade has seen a drastic drop in the number of spills and the amount of oil discharged. The strides toward improvement are impressive, but the reduction in spills, seems to be leading toward regionalization of local response assets and elimination of excess duplication by not replacing unserviceable equipment. Effective responses are also a key part of environmental sustainability. The end result could be a very expensive response, which could be simply averted by retaining current levels of local response capability. Understanding that the primary objective of any company is profit, environmental protection can provide one path toward financial reward. This includes, but is not limited to a ""green"" public image, which generally increases the consumer base and profits. The economic benefits of environmentally sound business practices, however, are not always initially apparent. Therefore, monetary gain may not always present sufficient motivation. In this case, proponents of environmental sustainability can cite social responsibility as cause, or look to the federal government for support and control. In an effort to stop the swing of the pendulum between a major disaster and the inability to respond, companies should be encouraged to maintain response capabilities at their current levels and to recognize that a loss of local response resources could be both an environmental and financial nightmare.",,"Business practices; Pollution prevention; Sustainability; Codes (standards); Disasters; Economic and social effects; Oil spills; Sustainable development; Marine pollution"

This separates CSR from the notion of corporate accountability that advocates that rather than being voluntary, working with CSR should by law be stated as a mandatory obligation for business actors. The strong focus on the environment in Norwegian industry may have taken corporate attention away from CSR issues. Also the fact that the Norwegian government has chosen to give the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a large responsibility for CSR in Norway has led to a stronger focus on issues related to foreign policy, such as human rights. In the finance sector, the actual transformation of CSR elements into action is seen most clearly, and the financial institutions are seen by many as the driver for both sustainability and corporate responsibility in Norway. The petroleum sector will continue to focus on the challenges it encounters when operating in foreign countries, and human rights and anti-corruption issues will therefore remain important elements in a Norwegian CSR development. With the growing internationalisation also of Norwegian business, we may see more individual CSR engagement by corporations in the future. The challenge for Norwegian companies in this context will be to follow up an increased communication on CSR with actual and measurable performance in this area, which goes beyond marketing and profiling. A more modern form of CSR, where mastering the social issues are being seen as an integrated competitive advantage, has only come into the debate in very recent years when especially banks and insurance companies took the lead. The finance sector may therefore continue to be the driver of CSR in Norway. Dialogue with NGOs and governments will continue to be an important aspect of CSR life in Norway, and has found a new expression in a rather unique new initiative called Inclusive Work (Inkluderende Arbeidsliv). Here Government and companies try to anticipate and evaluate what social challenges will develop (that can result in social stress and costly disability payments etc.), and try to cope with their root causes up front. Along with the Norwegian government and the other employers' and employees' organisations, NHO has signed a letter of intent regarding a more inclusive working life (NHO, 2002). One special feature of the CSR approach in Norway is, as suggested by the ongoing study by the Norwegian School of Management (Middtun, 2004), a different focus on transparency compared to other countries. While it seems to be a hot topic in the UK and other European countries, especially focusing on large firms (where as a consequence, larger firms are now underlining their transparency), Norwegian society is small and thus more transparent in itself: Norwegian media are therefore used to constantly analysing potential ""scandals"" of not ""walking the talk"". Combined with the traditional egalitarian attitude of society, i.e. not a dmiringextremely successful individuals without scrutinising them thoroughly, the Norwegian CSR approach may already be much more transparent and up to NGOscrutiny than in other European countries.A major challenge for the Norwegians is to balance the effects of communicating too much, with those of communicating too little, and transmit a clear and credible message continuously and consistently through the appropriate channels (Brønn & Wiig, 2002).",,

Opinions about the different actors involved in the food chain and the regulatory and control systems are contradictory, while attempts to provide trust with solid grounds are confronted with attitudes of mistrust, suspicion and resignation.

Business ethics is influenced by human action theory known as praxiology (Gasparski, 2002c) according to which human conduct is delimited by three dimensions or ""triple E"", i.e., effectiveness, efficiency and ethicality. Effectiveness is a dimension of the degree to which a state intended as a purpose of a given action is achieved; efficiency is a relation between an effect of the action and expenditure of its performance; ethicality is a dimension of the degree of social consent for performing the action in a given culture founded on values esteemed in the culture and on related norms of conduct. Effectiveness and efficiency are economical sensu stricto when one is able to measure them in monetary units. They are economical sensu lato when one is limited to their qualitative characteristics. Ethicality is qualitative by its nature. Both economical and ethical values are mutually independent when treated analytically, whereas in the synthetic sense the economical and ethical values, i.e., qualities of human actions expressed by these values, are mutually dependent formulating actions indispensable axiological context (Gasparski, 2002c). In relation to the above, corporate responsibility, as I understand2 it, should be defined as a whole composed of four characteristics taken together: • accomplishing the companys goal (increasing the companys value, delivering products and services of proper quality), • doing it in the long run (harmonious permanence), • ensured by proper shaping of relations with the main stakeholders (shareholders, employees, managers, clients, consumers, suppliers, local community, natural environment, etc.), and • through conduct compatible with law and socially accepted ethical norms (on the part of all the stakeholders).

Answering this question will contrast two kinds of quality ratings, the rating of single products and the rating of whole companies. Ratings of single products, on the one hand, have a long tradition. They exist mainly in two forms: Either products are judged by consumers according to their subjectively perceived quality. Or they are judged by experts who rate their practical use or functional quality according to objective and replicable test results. The most elaborated form of this system of objective quality rating is the method of comparative product testing. In many countries, comparative testing has a long history. In general, test results have a good reputation since they have proven to be valid indicators of technical product quality. Ratings of whole companies, on the other hand, do not have such a long tradition. They have been motivated by the growing wish of consumers to buy not only products of good quality but also products from good companies. There is, however, no consensus about what constitutes a ""good"" company. In a simplified way, two different approaches to the conceptualization of the pertinent criteria can be distinguished. One defines corporate excellence as a bundle of operational aspects of a company's production processes and managerial structures. The other focuses on a bundle of social responsibility, ecological values, and ""political correctness"" which a company feels compelled to subscribe to. Roughly speaking, company ratings can thus be in the nature either of operational ratings or of ethical ratings. These variants of company ratings co-exist in several countries. Since (at least in Germany) neither of the two kinds of company ratings is decisively dependent on the quality of a company'sproducts, the title of this paper does not raise a trivial, but indeed an open question. To answer this question empirically two sets of data are needed: for an adequate sample of companies, on the one hand, overall ratings of excellence and, on the other hand, quality scores of these companies' products as assessed by customers or by comparative tests. Since for Germany in two cases such a double set of datacould be made available, this paper can provide a tentative answer to the question posed. The paper is organized as follows. The first section puts forward a rationale of just why one should expect a positive correlation between company ratings and product quality. The following two sections report on two empirical studies, both conducted at the University of Hohenheim. The first study focuses on services markets, the second on goods markets. As both studies use the equivocal (user-based vs. expert-based) concept of product ratings and the even more ambiguous and immature concept of company ratings, it has to be determined first which variant of the two concepts is used in the respective study. The ensuing section of the paper discusses the results in light of the presented lines of thought and possible reasons why company ratings could be of use for the consumer's decision making. A quintessence completes the paper. The reader should note that throughout this paper, the termproduct refers to both (material) goods and (immaterial) services. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,

We will argue that the depth of these differences needs better understanding before considering the case for convergence of these roles as a basis for Europe-wide policies on ""CSR"" by companies and government policymakers alike. We mention ""CSR"" between inverted commas because it appears to us as an ill-defined concept with different interpretations. Its emergence can be better studied by considering the changing role of business (and government) in society. In part 1, we will propose that the central theoretical concept for the comparative study of the role of business (and government) in society is social contract, but that this concept needs to be underpinned by legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory in order to operationalise research into social contracts. In part 2, we will demonstrate how Hofstedes research (and follow-up research by others) have provided the empirical data that allows a certain explanation of the differences in the behaviours of different stakeholders with respect to corporate roles and responsibilities in different European societies. In part 3, we show how the comparative analysis of socio-political systems further explains these differences and provides a better understanding of why ""CSR"", as an Anglo-Saxon concept might get rooted in Germany and France, albeit in different ways. In part 4, we will provide a comparison of corporate governance systems in Europe which is crosslinked to the national culture profiles and national sociopolitical systems, building towards our proposed model of four main systems of the role of business (and government) in societies in Europe. In part 5, we will argue that corporate reputation research seems well fitted to explore differences in processes of gaining and maintaining legitimacy within different cultural and socio-political environments. We argued in part 1 that also legitimacy theory is needed to underpin comparative research of social contracts in Europe.",,

Clearly sustainability can provide benefits over the longer term, but most business operates according to more immediate economic constraints. These perceptions and realities combine with political and organizational impediments to cloud our understanding of the economic benefits of sustainable business practices, particularly those that accrue in the short term. It would appear that the organizational character of business is being shaped as much by legislation as the emerging deregulated institutional environment. This helps to explain the increasing influence of branding in the market place. If building a reputable brand name is assuming greater importance, questions about the role of sustainability in business need exploring. Empirical evidence that measures the influence of sustainability on branding, and thereby enables a financial apportionment of the economic return of sustainability is clearly needed. 'Balanced scorecard' is a well developed assessment tool that could provide a solid basis for comparing sustainability performance with reputation, and with modifications may provide a reasonably accurate way of calculating payback to business. Such a tool would be especially useful for those who see themselves as socially responsible corporate citizens keen to advance the environmental aspects of their business, but are simply unable to diminish profit imperatives. Moreover, its widespread use may also provide a way forward in the challenge to convey the community-wide message that 'sustainability pays'. To this end, the purpose here is to theoretically demonstrate that profit and politics matter when it comes to sustainability, and understanding and measuring sustainability is the first step in addressing this.","Balanced scorecard; Branding; Organisational change; Social responsibility; Sustainability","Assessment tool; Balanced scorecards; Brand names; Branding; Business needs; Economic benefits; Economic constraints; Economic returns; Empirical evidence; Environmental aspects; Market place; Organisational change; Short term; Social responsibilities; Solid basis; Sustainable business; Profitability; Research; Strategic planning; Sustainable development"

Indeed, media portraits of nanotech will influence investments, legislative and regulatory decisions, and commercialization of nanotech-based products. In this article, a team of social scientists analyzes how the media has historically portrayed nanotech. Media reports of nanoscale science and technology (""NST"") from 1986-2000 represented the field as an elite science emerging from well-known universities and corporate research centers. Media reports were overwhelmingly positive and based largely on speculation and opinion with fewer articles citing specific data or research methods. A small majority of articles presented NST as a natural progress within scientific fields, and other articles argued that NST was necessary simply because nanoscale devices create efficiencies or because a nanoscale revolution was inevitable. NST was affiliated most closely with computer research, medical applications and electronic applications. Rather than attempting to characterize media reporting of NST during this period in a single way, the authors conclude that NST was represented by multiple and competing frames. Sustained coverage of societal issues did not emerge until 2000, and this reporting was based entirely on opinion and speculation. The authors argue that in science writing, it is crucial that media reports be accurate, informative, and critical. While some of this responsibility passes to those providing source data for journalistic research, science writers must also recognize the role they play in explaining, critiquing, and legitimizing NST.",,"Elite science; Nanoscale devices; Nanoscale science; Specific data; Decision theory; Investments; Laws and legislation; Medical applications; Nanostructured materials; Social sciences computing; Nanotechnology"

The free-market system, especially with global competition, provides powerful pressures to cut costs, and costs are often cut in ways that do damage to suppliers, employees, or other people. Yet the demands of Wall Street analysts to increase share price are unrelenting. What some call ""free market fundamentalism"" provides both a rationale and an incentive to make all of one's decisions on the basis of the dollar results that accrue to oneself and one's own interests. In the last few years a stream of executives have confessed to inflating revenues and hiding expenses so that their firm may meet Wall Street's earnings expectations. Many of these top executives have been indicted, tried and jailed for their unethical and illegal behavior. Even groups with special professional oversight responsibilities, such as the accounting firms, the AICPA and the New York Stock Exchange, have been caught in self-serving conflicts of interest. It is thus more difficult for the professional to work in such firms, and still retain professional ethical principles. A person's own individual values can also be a barrier for the professional who attempts to maintain moral balance. The behavior of the executives who managed the corporate crimes - whether it was ""managing the numbers,"" insider trading, disproportionate personal compensation, and/or spending lavishly on oneself - show how these men were self-centered and unethical. Such behavior is not that of a morally mature or ethical person. On the other hand, the market, legal and social systems, the particular organization, and a person's moral maturity each can also aid the individual professional in an organization. The market rewards the executive and firm that over the long term provides quality products, treats workers, suppliers, and shareholders with respect, and has good relations with its local community. A firm's good reputation is one of its major assets. Legislation, regulation, and voluntary codes help to stabilize the market, so that an unscrupulous manager cannot obtain an unfair advantage. Some organizations are better than others in providing support to the individual professional who seeks to make ethical decisions. If a manager has options when seeking a job, he/she knows that it is wise to find a firm that respects all workers, uses and does not abuse the ethical skills of its people, and has open communications. Mission statements, codes, employee orientations, and worker actions all provide important information on the professional environment of the particular firm. The most important factor that helps the professional to retain and build professional integrity is that person's own moral maturity and character. This gives a professional the equilibrium and perseverance that we saw demonstrated in Cynthia Cooper, internal auditor at WorldCom. A personal spirituality can also help the professional person build character and moral maturity; it can give a person a broader perspective and a firm foundation. A spirituality also helps the professional to see her/his work as more than a job, but something that has meaning for others, also. Priest professionals in the Catholic Church face a variety of obstacles to their own professional development. The shortage of priests places strains on these men. They are expected to deliver the same services to a much larger number of people, and thus suffer some of the same effects as survivors of ""downsizing"" among business firms - often being overwhelmed with work. The sexual abuse scandal and the ""zero tolerance"" policy of the bishops, has also made many priests feel vulnerable to false accusations. On the other hand, priests also have many aids to their professional development. They do not experience the same competitive market pressures found in business. They can rely more on the honesty and trust of their superiors, peers, and the people in their parishes. Their recognition of their call to this work also provides a foundation for them. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,

Within that group 17.6%, about 12 million children, were living in poverty (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004b). Of the children classified as living in poverty, most lived in metropolitan areas. As defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), metropolitan areas are geographic entities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, or an urbanized area made up of a central place and adjacent territories where the general population density is at least 1000 people per square mile of land (U.S. Census Bureau 2004c). The largest city in a metropolitan area is called a ""central city"" or an urban center. These densely populated urban cities are home to most children living in poverty in metropolitan areas. The term ""urban"" often carries with it references to poverty, crime, or disadvantaged marginalized populations. When searching for information on urban children, terms such as inner-city, at-risk, and socially disadvantaged are listed as related terms and used interchangeably. While this chapter gives attention to disadvantaged urban youth, the term ""urban"" is used with caution. Not all urban children confront trouble at home, violence in the streets, and/or problems at school. However, the focus of this chapter is ""at-risk"" children who are often systematically locked out of the benefits of urban life. In this chapter, the term ""at-risk urban children"" is defined as youth who reside in central cities, and have an increased chance of academic failure because of personal behaviors, past educational difficulties, or family problems (Midkiff et al., 1991). Because of low academic performance, at-risk children are more likely to live in poverty, maintain a low employment status and engage in criminal behaviors later in life (National Center for Family Literacy, 2003). Theorists note that factors contributing to the decline of the city, such as white and corporate flight, de-industrialization and post-industrial transformation have led to high poverty in urban centers (Gingrich, 1998; Kantor and Brenzel, 1992; Lynn et al., 2003; Ogbu, 1994). An examination of the decline of the urban center from the 1920s to the 1990s illuminates the relationship between the city and the services it provides. This relationship contributes significantly to the deterioration of urban education and the inequities that exist in many urban school and public library systems across the United States. Beginning in the 1920s, African-American southerners in search of employment migrated to urban centers in the north (Kantor and Brenzel, 1992; Kozol, 1991; Orr, 1999). During the 1930s and 1940s, these individuals were increasingly forced out of agricultural positions in the south due to mechanization, and subsequently lured to northern cities by the demands for massive numbers of low-skilled workers needed to fulfill the industrial demands created by WWII11African-American migration began to slow by the 1970s, just as Latino migration began in large numbers and continues today. Latinos from Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and Puerto Rico migrated to the United States lured by the same demand for low-skilled employees (Kantor and Brenzel, 1992).. As people of color moved into the urban centers, white people began to move out. This phenomenon, known as ""white flight,"" created a largely poor, minority urban center and a wealthy, rich suburb. In many areas, the ""city"" was primarily made up of impoverished, marginalized individuals and families living in low-income neighborhoods, who were kept from moving out by unfair housing practices and racial discrimination (Kantor and Brenzel, 1992; Kozol, 1991). The trend of minority migration to the city for employment and white flight to the suburbs would continue for decades. Post-war market changes of the 1950s further contributed to the decline of urban areas. After the war, manufacturing activities in the cities decreased and the need for a large, low-skilled labor force dried up (Kantor and Brenzel, 1992; Kozol, 1991; Orr, 1999). Because of stagnant post-war economic conditions and increased competition from international companies, US factories moved from cities to suburbs to take advantage of lower taxes and operating costs. This corporate flight and lack of jobs led to unemployment for the substantial numbers of undereducated and unskilled laborers of color who were unqualified for the developing information driven professions and, therefore, locked into low-wage jobs. Post-industrial transformation, or the change of the economy from industrialization to ""financial, administrative and social service"" (Kantor and Brenzel, 1992), resulted in many African-American city dwellers being unprepared to compete in the new labor market. Thus, the combination of northern migration, white and corporate flight, de-industrialization and post-industrial transformation have contributed to the decline of urban cities. These factors have led to concentrated areas of people of color, high levels of unemployment, and poverty for many of the adults and children that live in urban areas today (Kantor and Brenzel, 1992; Kozol, 1991). Libraries, Education and Children in the United States: Libraries have long been part of the history of the American education system. Historians have documented the presence of libraries in schools since the early 19th century (Clyde, 1999). Libraries for and funded by the public, with the mission of meeting the needs and interests of children, appear as early as 1835 (Gross, 1967; Power, 1943). According to the American Library Association (ALA), the mission of libraries includes the principle that: ""books and other library resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves"" (American Library Association, 2004c). This mission embraces all people, even those who have been relegated to the lower rungs of the American social hierarchy. In particular, public and school libraries offer services and resources to all members of their communities-regardless of race, color, religion, or class. By providing equal information access, school and public libraries often serve as spaces for social change and liberation. They are seen as ""places in which children of poor people have a chance to broaden their horizons and expand the reference points of their vocabulary and imagination"" (Kozol, 2000). However, libraries exist within the structure of inequity that characterizes the American education system (Bowles, 1976). Unequal funding between rich and poor schools leads to inadequate library facilities, outdated print collections and unqualified staff. Kozol states that ""archaic systems of financial allocation"" lead to ""a conscious act of social demarcation: a shameful way of building barriers around a child's mind, of starving intellect, of amputating dreams"" (Kozol, 2000, p. 4). The decline of the city has affected the availability and quality of the services available to children in urban areas including library services. School and public libraries share the responsibility of meeting the information needs of the children they serve. This chapter addresses four questions regarding library services to urban youth:1What challenges do urban children face that make them a unique library user population?2What strategies and initiatives have been put in place since the 1970s to meet the information needs of urban children, and which of these initiatives have been successful?3What factors have affected the implementation of these initiatives over the last 30 years?4What are the common characteristics of successful programs related to these strategies and initiatives? © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws its empirical information from the CSR reports and information posted on the world wide web by the UK's top ten UK country of origin retailers. Four principal headings: namely, Environment; Marketplace; Workplace; and Community, are used to capture, and provide some illustrative examples of, CSR agendas. Findings - The findings reveal that each of the top ten retailers has its own approach to CSR and that there are substantial variations in the nature and extent of the reporting process. That said there is some common ground in reporting on a range of environmental issues, on sourcing, on commitment to customers, on employees and on the communities in which the top ten retailers operate. A number of the top ten retailers are employing key performance indicators in an attempt to measure and benchmark their CSR achievements. The underlying message is that the top ten retailers claim that CSR is an integral element of their core business. Originality/value - The paper provides an accessible review of CSR agendas being pursued by the UK's top ten retailers and as such will interest academics and students in higher education and practitioners and professionals working in the retail marketplace. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Retailers; Social responsibility; United Kingdom",

First, the effect on the labour force composition, i.e. do particular types of concerns attract certain kinds of employees? Second, the effect on the wage level within the firm, i.e. do firm-provided social concerns substitute for money wages, or are they provided as an additional compensation? Design/methodology/approach - Empirical analysis using a survey on more than 2,000 firms, linked to administrative data for each employee in the firms. Estimates wage equations using the IV approach to deal with endogeneity of the level of social concerns. Two competing theories aiming to explain the use of social concerns toward employees, the compensating wage differential theory and corporate social responsibility, are compared. Findings - Finds indications in favour of the compensating wage differential theory when looking at wage effects at the firm level, whereas looking at the target group level finds that white-collar workers might experience higher levels of social concerns without having lower wages, which contrast the theory of compensating wage differentials. Originality/value - The paper compare two well-established theories within two different disciplines - the compensating wage differential theory from economics, and CSR from management.

Corporate responsibility for employees is considered important by various stakeholders, and occupational safety and health is regarded as one of these responsibilities. The present authors examined this issue from the viewpoint of corporate management by analysis of statements found in CSR-related reports. For companies listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), we searched for CSR-related reports, and titles and contents, based on two established guidelines: the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 2002 as the international reference and the Environmental Reporting Guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan, as the domestic reference. Corporations that published CSR reports were 26.3% (416/1,581) of the total, and large differences were recognized by type of industry. Comparing the numbers of pages for various contents, more concern was shown about the environment than about social activity, indicating the environment to be the main issue of CSR in Japan. In the items included in the guidelines, many matters about occupational accidents were mentioned, but it was found that statements regarding HIV/AIDS, which is not of such strong social concern in Japan, and statements regarding the costs of safety that are difficult to calculate were few. However, statements regarding mental health, which is of high interest socially, were many, even though this issue is not included in the two guidelines used. In revising the guidelines, these matters should be reviewed. In the future, continuance of analysis of CSR-related reports with regard to changes and comparisons with overseas reports will help improve occupational safety and health.","Companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange; Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Environmental Reporting Guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment; First Section; Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); Occupational safety and health","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; article; environmental factor; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Japan; mental health; occupational health; occupational safety; social behavior; Commerce; Humans; Japan; Occupational Health; Organizational Policy; Social Responsibility; Human immunodeficiency virus"

However, as sanctions have failed to trigger political reform, it is necessary to review the policy options. The focus here is on the contribution socially responsible corporations might make to change. The article sketches contextual features of the case, examines the recent history and present pattern of business links with Myanmar, and assesses whether current approaches can stimulate reform. Concluding that they cannot, it considers fresh possibilities for corporate engagement. The argument is that socially responsible corporations, committed to improving individual life chances through engagement with developing societies, should undertake collaborative and principled direct investment in Myanmar. The underlying strategy and problems of codification and implementation are all analyzed.

The result is investors vulnerable to the risks companies face in global consumer and capital markets. Though some market risks are inevitable, others, such as reputation risk, can be mitigated through increased corporate social and environmental standards and the increased transparency that such higher standards demand. The transparency necessitated by reputation management has a dual role in monitoring corporate behaviour and providing all stakeholders (internal and external) with the information to evaluate corporate behaviour. Driving this process is the belief that higher standards of corporate responsibility pay off for investors over the long term both through potential equity premia and through risk reduction. This paper presents a model for understanding how and why institutional investors may encourage firms to adopt higher standards. To illustrate our argument, we refer to the experience of the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) strategy of corporate engagement and the attempts of the USS to encourage firms to raise their environmental standards by focusing on the climate change impacts of pension-fund investments.

It also draws on firsthand economic and financial empirical data, and then analyzes the reasons why French firms have adopted this discourse and integrated many practices prevalent in the US private sector. It shows that the globalization of production and capital has created in France a favorable context for the reinterpretation of corporate social responsibility, despite France's political and historical specificity with respect to human rights. As French companies have become increasingly transnational in their operations and reliant on nonresident capital, they have been more willing to take norms of corporate social responsibility into account. This economic context has had three major effects. First, it has influenced the construction of a domestic public space and new social networks - a market of virtue - based on cooperation among non-governmental organizations, norms activists and businesses. Second, it has influenced some firms in the definition of their international strategy. Finally, it has compelled the French state to react in economic regulatory terms. Nonstate actors are thus constructing new norms, shaping the economic public debate, compelling states to react, and setting new public policies. © 2005 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.",,"corporate strategy; human rights; multinational enterprise; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe"

The complaint alleged that Schering-Plough's subsidiary in Poland made charitable contributions to a Polish historic preservation organization, the President of which was the Director of a government program that financed the acquisition of medical supplies in the Polish region of Silesia. Coincident with the contributions, there was a significant increase in sales by Schering-Plough to the Silesian government's health-care network. Schering-Plough's country manager, who authorized the payments, was found to have falsified the charitable contributions on the subsidiary's books and to have concealed them from the head office of the parent company. The case is noteworthy for a number of reasons. It is the first instance in which making charitable contributions was alleged to violate the FCPA. Consequently, the case has implications for corporate charitable giving and the social responsibility projects supported by many multinational companies. The case also underscores the SEC's position that enforcement actions under the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA may be brought against parent companies for the actions of their subsidiaries even when the parent has no knowledge of the subsidiary's actions. More importantly, the case suggests that registrants may be liable for FCPA violations if they fail to install internal controls to scrutinize links between government officials and the activities of their overseas subsidiaries, including their charitable giving. Finally, the case highlights the widening scope of the SEC's FCPA enforcement activities, facilitated by the increased resources that were made available to the Commission in the aftermath of recent corporate scandals.",,

The effort towards CSR engagement in the tobacco industry is not only heavily criticized by anti-tobacco NGOs. Some opponents such as the the World Health Organization have even categorically questioned the possibility of social responsibility in the tobacco industry. The paper will demonstrate that the deep distrust towards tobacco companies is linked to the lethal character of their products and the dubious behavior of their representatives in recent decades. As a result, tobacco companies are not in the CSR business in the strict sense. Key aspects of mainstream CSR theory and practice such as corporate philanthropy, stakeholder collaboration, CSR reporting and self-regulation, are demonstrated to be ineffective or even counterproductive in the tobacco industry. Building upon the terminology used in the leadership literature, the paper proposes to differentiate between transactional and transformational CSR arguing that tobacco companies can only operate on a transactional level. As a consequence, corporate responsibility in the tobacco industry is based upon a much thinner approach to CSR and has to be conceptualized with a focus on transactional integrity across the tobacco supply chain. © Springer 2005.","Corporate philanthropy; CSR; Integrity; Organizational legitimacy; The common good; Tobacco industry; Transactional CSR; Transformational CSR",

Medical professionalism in a changing world.",2005,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33644909098&partnerID=40&md5=2f79391614d6e44b675bb3fa82805928","Medicine bridges the gap between science and society. Indeed, the application of scientific knowledge to human health is a crucial aspect of clinical practice. Doctors are one important agent through which that scientific understanding is expressed. But medicine is more than the sum of our knowledge about disease. Medicine concerns the experiences, feelings, and interpretations of human beings in often extraordinary moments of fear, anxiety, and doubt. In this extremely vulnerable position, it is medical professionalism that underpins the trust the public has in doctors. This Working Party was established to define the nature and role of medical professionalism in modern society. Britain's health system is undergoing enormous change. The entry of multiple health providers, the wish for more equal engagement between patients and professionals, and the ever-greater contribution of science to advances in clinical practice all demand a clear statement of medicine's unifying purpose and doctors' common values. What is medical professionalism and does it matter to patients? Although evidence is lacking that more robust professionalism will inevitably lead to better health outcomes, patients certainly understand the meaning of poor professionalism and associate it with poor medical care. The public is well aware that an absence of professionalism is harmful to their interests. The Working Party's view, based on the evidence it has received, is that medical professionalism lies at the heart of being a good doctor. The values that doctors embrace set a standard for what patients expect from their medical practitioners. The practice of medicine is distinguished by the need for judgement in the face of uncertainty. Doctors take responsibility for these judgements and their consequences. A doctor's up-to-date knowledge and skill provide the explicit scientific and often tacit experiential basis for such judgements. But because so much of medicine's unpredictability calls for wisdom as well as technical ability, doctors are vulnerable to the charge that their decisions are neither transparent nor accountable. In an age where deference is dead and league tables are the norm, doctors must be clearer about what they do, and how and why they do it. We define medical professionalism as a set of values, behaviours, and relationships that underpin the trust the public has in doctors. We go on to describe what those values, behaviours, and relationships are, how they are changing, and why they matter. This is the core of our work. We have also identified six themes where our definition has further implications: leadership, teams, education, appraisal, careers, and research. The Working Party's definition and description of medical professionalism, and the recommendations arising from them, can be found in Section 5 of this report. If our recommendations are acted upon, we believe that professionalism could flourish and prosper to the benefit of patients and doctors alike. However, the exercise of medical professionalism is hampered by the political and cultural environment of health, which many doctors consider disabling. The conditions of medical practice are critical determinants for the future of professionalism. We argue that doctors have a responsibility to act according to the values we set out in this report. Equally, other members of the healthcare team--notably managers--have a reciprocal duty to help create an organisational infrastructure to support doctors in the exercise of their professional responsibilities. Just as the patient-doctor partnership is a pivotal therapeutic relationship in medicine, so the interaction between doctor and manager is central to the delivery of professional care. High-quality care depends on both effective health teams and efficient health organisations. Professionalism therefore implies multiple commitments--to the patient, to fellow professionals, and to the institution or system within which healthcare is provided, to the extent that the system supports patients collectively. A doctor's corporate responsibility, shared as it is with managers and others, is a frequently neglected aspect of modern practice. The audience for this report is, first and foremost, doctors. But we believe it should be of equal interest to patients, policy-makers, members of other health professions, and the media. All these groups have a vital part to play in discussing and advancing medical professionalism. This report is only the beginning of an effort by the Royal College of Physicians, together with others, to initiate a public dialogue about the role of the doctor in creating a healthier and fairer society. Medical professionalism has roots in almost every aspect of modern healthcare. This Working Party could not hope to solve all the issues and conflicts surrounding professionalism in practice today. But our collective and abiding wish is to put medical professionalism back onto the political map of health in the UK.",,"article; doctor patient relation; human; leadership; medical society; perception; physician attitude; professional practice; social change; social psychology; sociology; standard; trust; United Kingdom; Great Britain; Humans; Leadership; Physician's Role; Physician-Patient Relations; Professional Practice; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Social Change; Social Perception; Social Values; Societies, Medical; Sociology, Medical; Trust"

In the aftermath of a failed merger, new leaders of The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and Milton S. Hershey Medical Center encountered a climate of readiness for a transformational change. In a case study of this process, nine critical success factors are described that contributed to significant performance improvement: performing a campus-wide cultural assessment and acting decisively on the results; making values explicit and active in everyday decisions; aligning corporate structure and governance to unify the academic enterprise and health system; aligning the next tier of administrative structure and function; fostering collaboration and accountability-the creation of unified campus teams; articulating a succinct, highly focused, and compelling vision and strategic plan; using the tools of mission-based management to realign resources; focusing leadership recruitment on organizational fit; and ""growing your own"" through broad-based leadership development. Outcomes assessment data for academic, research, and clinical performance showed significant gains between 2000 and 2004.

There is increasing acceptance of the idea that such strategies should go further than to stress the responsibility of the individual and focus on wider socioeconomic and environmental factors. This is true also for the promotion of healthy eating, and as industry increases its awareness towards corporate social responsibility and societal issues, the actors of the private commercial food sector begin to discover healthy eating as an important theme, which they have to relate to in their strategic planning and management. This paper presents evidence that supports this contention and discusses the implications of the seemingly changed distribution of responsibilities for the promotion of healthy eating between governments and the food industry. From findings in the social sciences it tries to explain why corporate stakeholders start focusing on societal expectations, and why this development may coincide with a decline in government responsibility.

To help fill this gap, this paper reports the findings of a preliminary investigation to establish the key E&SR factors affecting grocery shopping behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - The study drew upon existing literature in the areas of ethics, social responsibility, shopping and store image to identify the individual elements of E&SR. An exploratory qualitative study of E&SR consumers (E&SRC) was then conducted, using seven focus groups, and a typology of key factors of concern to these consumers was derived from analysis. Findings - The findings identify seven core categories, containing seventy-one sub-categories. These interlink to form three main clusters:food quality and safety, human rights and ethical trading, and environmental (green) issues. Shoppers trade off these E&SR factors against standard retail purchasing factors, in particular convenience, price and merchandise range when deciding which shops to use and what products to buy. Research limitations/implications - The typology derived from this exploratory research may be used alongside conventional store image factors in future research, to help predict those factors that influence purchasing behaviour. Similarly, it may assist brand and retail managers in profiling, and meeting the needs of, E&SRC.

Its rationale lies in the figure of the generalised customer. Design/methodology/approach - The generalised customer stems from a combination of stakeholder theory and sociological role theory. The stakeholder theory discusses the different stakeholder roles from an organisational perspective, whereas the sociological role theory views essentially the same roles and relationships from the individual's perspective. Focus lies in the personal preferences and attitudes accompanying the different roles one person plays in society - as a consumer, father, or member of Amnesty International. Findings - A first attempt to put these roles and relationships in a sustainability context - providing an impression of all possible needs, wants, and expectations a company can expect from its customers. This notion alters marketing's view of the customer and brings about a new understanding of customer satisfaction. Practical implications - Customer satisfaction must be seen in a more holistic, multidimensional perspective in future. Companies succeeding in taking this step towards sustainable management will raise their profile among customers, differentiate themselves from the competition, and achieve legitimacy vis-à-vis society.

As a consequence, this paper deals with the relevance of a stakeholder orientation in a frame of corporate social responsibility as a precondition for sustainability. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",,

We introduce a conceptual model in which a CSR Critical Incident passes through three ""regulators"" which influence the significance of the episode. Depending on the significance of the episode, influenced by the regulators, three responsive strategies are outlined and discussed. The study is based on a case study methodology and focuses on three cases reflecting an environmental disaster, business ethics difficulties and human rights issues.

Stakeholder relations management (SRM) is one such way, through which corporations are confronted with economic, social, and environmental stakeholder claims. This paper lays the groundwork for an empirical analysis of the question of how far SD can be achieved through SRM. It describes the so-called SD-SRM perspective as a distinctive research approach and shows how it relates to the wider body of stakeholder theory. Next, the concept of SD is operationalized for the microeconomic level with reference to important documents. Based on the ensuing SD framework, it is shown how SD and SRM relate to each other, and how the two concepts relate to other popular concepts such as Corporate Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility. The paper concludes that the significance of societal guiding models such as SD and of management approaches like CSR is strongly dependent on their footing in society. © Springer 2005.","Corporate Responsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility/ CSR; Corporate stakeholder; Environmental management; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder relations management; Sustainability; Sustainable development",

These regulations focus on fundamental aspects of the production process and on its negative externalities so that nearly every sector of the economy is affected. However, the US is quite distinct from other countries in terms of regulatory patterns. The American format of regulatory laws, the process of regulatory policy-making, and the ways in implementing regulations are more legalistic, and more adversarial than other advanced countries. Legalism in US social regulations resulted in bigger uncertainties, higher litigation and legal expenditures, and heavier compliance and opportunity costs, as well as causing firms to become defensive and alienated. As domestic regulations are increasingly becoming insufficient to deal with problems arising from globalized production, differences in American regulatory content and legal implementations from other countries will affect its competitiveness in the global economy. We argue, in this paper, that the impact of social regulations on the whole of society is not large, but the impact of higher liability and legal costs can be more pronounced for particular industries. However, as long as the higher regulatory costs do not proportionately fall on inputs of production, US companies will not be at a competitive disadvantage.","Adversarial Legalism; Comparative Economic Systems; Competitiveness; Corporate Social Responsibility; Globalization; Government-business Cooperation; Industrial Policy; Regulatory policy; Social Cost and Benefit; Social Safety Legislation",

Design/methodology/approach - Surveys a set of SMEs, belonging to different industrial fields and operating on the Italian territory in the region Emilia Romagna. Findings - On the basis of the analysis carried out in the paper, it has been possible to identify the principal managerial instruments used by the companies for the creation of social value and to identify those companies (approximately 63 percent of the reference sample) that adopt an integrated social responsibility approach. The majority of SMEs analysed have therefore perceived the social responsibility concept and welcome it, not only because they have moral or ethical reasons for doing so, but also because they maintain that this contributes to the growth of the company's own value. Practical implications - As there is no integrated approach, there exists no model in the literature that summarises the expectations of the stakeholders and the associated categories of value for these expectations. The ""grid of values"" developed in the present study constitutes a first level of such a model and a useful reference for the development of future research.

Through a CSR framework which was developed in an exploratory study, we explore the nature of stakeholder relationships reported across leading FTSE companies and the importance they attach to communicating both social and business outcomes. It is evident from the hypotheses tested that the bigger FTSE companies, particularly extraction companies and telecoms, are more adept at identifying and prioritising their stakeholders, and linking CSR programmes to business and social outcomes. However, we draw the general conclusion that building stronger stakeholder relationships through CSR programmes - other than with customers - is not currently a priority for most companies.

In contrast, other authors claim that hardly any progress is to be expected because of the inherently normative character of the literature.

This leads to a discussion about the notion of discretion and an examination of a separate, contrary body of literature which indicates that some individuals in corporations may use their discretion to behave in a socially entrepreneurial manner.

The elements of corporate reputation that seem to matter most to consumers in practice are perceptions of fairness toward consumers, and perceptions of corporate success and leadership, rather than public responsibility.

The case entrepreneur is striving for the so-called double bottom line of both financial and social returns. The paper analyses the relationship between the entrepreneur who is both socially responsible and business-oriented and a putative mainstream venture capitalist interested in the financial success of the venture. It is asserted that venture capitalists may not be initially interested in investing due to the social targets of the entrepreneur and due to the disruptive nature of the venture's business concept. In the case company the social goals do not need to be 'sold' to investors as the these are derived automatically from the core business. Any increase in the case venture's business operations leads automatically both to financial profits and social returns. It is discussed whether the bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) strategy provides a solution to problems related to disruptive innovations. The theoretical business model applicable in the BOP markets is based on high volumes seeking millions of customers. The use of the high-volume target in the case venture's business is analysed. This may also present a solution to the double-bottom-line problem. The growth in volume automatically raises social returns by creating benefits for an increasingly wider proportion of the population. This case serves as an example of at least two more general problems: (1) the different time-frames of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs; and (2) conflicts of interest between industry incumbents and innovators of new technologies and new business models.","Bottom-of-the-pyramid strategies; Corporate social responsibility; Disruption innovation; Entrepreneurial venture; High-volume targets; Venture capitalists","bottom-up approach; business development; capitalism; entrepreneur; innovation; market conditions; strategic approach"

This state of affairs is linked with: pressure from stakeholders, short-term tactics, hegemony of financial considerations, 'juridisation' of business, the tyranny of communications and the media and the difficulties in translating strategy into practical implementation. The paper scrutinises the motivation and the psychology of entrepreneurs and business people, and their behaviour is compared to other professional groups and confronted with the decline in ethics in society as described by some important observers. The conclusion drawn is that the recent positive evolutions do not provide sufficient ethical guidelines for the day-to-day activities of middle managers and entrepreneurs in the present competitive environment. Managers will always be confronted by difficult choices with ethical dilemmas. There will always be a tension between theory and pragmatism, but progress can be made with the effective implementation of the ethical discourse in companies.

The pacesetter model is developed in the following steps: changed stakeholder expectations, pacesetter emergence, heightened attention and pressure, decision making under pressure, and implementation and compliance. The model is then applied to analyze the confrontation between the mainline pharmaceutical industry and AIDS activists and stakeholders over access to AIDS medications in Africa. Analysis of this confrontation demonstrates that issue pacesetters increased the effectiveness of stakeholders in placing institutional pressure on the pharmaceutical industry and contributed to the industry changing its regulations regarding access to AIDS drugs. © 2005 Sage Publications.","AIDS; Corporate social responsibility; Issue life cycle; Issue management; Pharmaceutical industry; Stakeholders",

An RFID system works by having a reader and antenna which receive information from a number of tags through radio signals. RFID can be considered as a more efficient successor to the barcode, with the added benefits of tracking individual items, and the ability to scan numerous items very rapidly out of line of sight. The technology has already been effectively applied in areas such as manufacturing, security, and collecting tolls. The potential of RFID technology to cut the time the assistant spends in chasing stock frees up time to spend with the customer, and will hopefully increase sales.

Assessing the effectiveness of these efforts, it examines both the new movements and the issues they are tackling. With three key case studies on the clothing industry, sustainable forestry and corporate social responsibility, it explores the tensions between politics and management, examining the theoretical implications of regulation for politics, citizenship and the state.

Can socially responsible investors, integrating environmental, social and ethical issues in their investment policy, expect the same return as traditional investors? Design/methodology/approach - Based on the sustainability ratings of a specialized rating agency, Vigeo, a Fama and French approach is performed to adapt for style biases in the performances. Findings - The results indicate that, on a style-adjusted basis, high sustainability-rated portfolios have performed better than low-rated portfolios, but, probably due to the short horizon, not to a significant extent. The same results are found for four out of the five sub-ratings of which the sustainability rating is composed, suggesting that sustainability is a broad and multidimensional concept that cannot be attributed to one specific theme or topic. The results also indicate that investors are ready to pay a premium for companies with good management of their relations with shareholders, clients and suppliers.

The present research proposes that this relationship can be better understood if the concept of trustworthiness is included. Design/methodology/approach - Using an experimental design, the present research presents a study in which the presence or absence of environmental commitment information in a company profile is manipulated and presented to consumers, and reports the differences in the measures of consumers' perceptions of company trustworthiness and its sources originated by this manipulation. The analysis of these differences provided evidence of significant positive effects on perceived benevolence and negative effects on perceived ability measures. Findings - The findings of the present research seem to indicate that, in some contexts, companies' cause commitment can have different (positive and negative) effects on consumers' perception of firms' trustworthiness. Research limitations/implications - The small sample size is the principal limitation of the study. Also the exclusion of personal and cultural values as moderators of the effects is a limitation.

Based on the comparison of these theories in addition to a qualitative case study in the reinsurance industry some practical insights will be provided into and managerial implications developed regarding how to respond to the challenges of corporate responsibility due to multiculturalism. Findings - It is claimed that corporations which follow a CSR understanding corresponding to the pyramid of Kang and Wood are better prepared to deal with differences regarding CSR orientation in different cultures compared with corporations that are based on the thinking of Carroll's pyramid. Originality/value - Changing societal concerns and different local expectations across various countries, in the context of instantaneous world-wide communication, have strongly increased the exposure of corporations to external criticism and challenge. These effects are intensified for large multinational firms, where complex interactions among distant and diverse constituencies have become commonplace. Broad societal concerns challenge the core strategies of corporations and require strategic responses. But this important strategic challenge response process cannot be analyzed within the traditional views of the firm.

Design/methodology/approach - By analyzing typical roles and role-sets in political, commercial and regulatory exchange, the article pin-points characteristics of the embedded relational governance/ CSR model contrasted against liberal governance and the Keynesian welfare state. The analysis is stylized and conceptually based, in line with the Weberian ideal type concept and brings out stylized juxtapositions of the three governance models based on previous studies. Findings - An emerging model of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or embedded relational governance seems to share the basic market orientation of the liberal model, yet, at the same time, sharing many of the social and collective goals of the welfare state. This combination is apparently achieved by embedding the social dimension into civil society and self-regulatory market processes. Finally, the paper reflects on the drivers behind the new governance approach, in the context of a globalizing economy. The paper argues that NGO-driven communicative intermediation interfacing with an increasing CSR and corporate governance focus in financial evaluation may serve to retain some of the social agenda from the welfare state, under the CSR- or embedded-relational model, an agenda that seemed to be gradually losing out with the global competitive exposure of the welfare state. Research limitations/implications - The article presents a stylized analytical framework of CSR/embedded relational governance that lays a basis for further exploration and systematic testing through comparative empirical studies.

Community Based on Forest Management (CBFM) has been developed since 2001, which has purpose to implement corporate social responsibility enhancing the prosperity and quality of life of all stakeholders. As an illustration of deforestation and forest degradation in Java which mostly caused by excessive logging, Perhutani as a State Owned Forestry Enterprise had loss about US $10 million per year from the total area ± 2.5 million hectares. Operationally, CBFM adopted by process development people awareness to achieve bilateral matching, build up participatory strategic plan, providing legal contract between Perhutani and MDH (community forest), implementation project, and monitoring. To determine the effectiveness of the program towards forestland security and community welfare action research carried out in 20 Forest Management Unit (FMU) from total 57 FMU in Java. Research worked out on three priority aspects: Social impact (understanding the function of forest and agreeing to contribute on CBFM framework), Economic scale (forest advantages), and Ecological impact (illegal harvesting and encroachment standard, rewarding of reforestation). Preliminary result shown 10 out of 20 FMU implemented the CBFM by following the procedures required Only 50 % Unit Management got success to establish bilateral matching and fulfill participatory strategic plan.

Design/methodology/approach - The research draws from three longitudinal case studies that were carried out on UK institutions that have adopted a responsible investment policy. Findings - Evidence of behavioral obstacles to responsible investing were found, including short-termism, gravitation towards defensible decisions and reluctance to integrate corporate responsibility factors into the core investment process. Based on the case study evidence these appear to be driven by the influence of prevailing dominant conventions, reinforced by institutional herding tendencies. Research limitations/implications - The paper introduces some preliminary thoughts as to how conventions might be resisted and changed over time through the institutional herding mechanism. Further research is required (and is currently under way) to more closely examine the potential impact of investor collaboration for challenging dominant conventions.

If they were, did this response result in innovation and transformation? The 14 issues were identified by a range of business practitioners and experts through a visioning exercise. Design/methodology/approach - Independent data analysis of the companies, excluding around 50 investment trusts, by SERM Rating Agency provided a sector review of how companies were innovating or transforming their business as a response to the 14 issues. This review identified 40 companies as being most active in demonstrating their response. Of these 40, further analysis identified ten companies that showed signs of innovation or transformation. Findings - The identified ten companies demonstrated evidence of pilot business transformation (or incremental innovation towards transformation) as a direct result of responding to the issues. For example, a mining company's HIV treatment program for its workers in South Africa. Most approaches were characterized by a wide-ranging series of incremental changes, with no convincing examples yet existing of transformation implemented across the entirety of the company's operations. Hints of this radical direction, however, are evident from the vision statements of several organizations. Research limitations/implications - The research methodology is dependent on publicly available evidence. However, the implication of the research findings is that the 14 issues identified can be viewed as opportunities rather than obligations. Realizing the opportunity relies on integrating the issues in the core strategy of the organization. Practical implications - This paper provides insight for business strategists and practitioners into potential new ways of working by companies. It illuminates an emerging source of innovation and ultimately business transformation driven by the growing significance of world issues to implementing corporate strategy and delivering sustainable profit.

Aims to show that some do this by using a universally applicable set of policies, approaches, rights and responsibilities, while others believe it is better for companies to manage the issues most material to where they are operating. Design/methodology/approach - This paper, drawing on empirical studies in five continents, examines how companies identify and manage societal expectations when the notion of society itself is undergoing change, and the relationship between business and wider society is being revisited. Findings - Discusses the experience of employing global social and environmental standards, the value of thinking in terms of a global ethic, and whose interests are served by this approach. Argues that, with certain important caveats, current approaches to managing the social and environmental dimensions of global supply chains provide at best a crude means of tackling societal expectations that can mislead managers into thinking they have the problem in hand. Research limitations/implications - This paper has consequences not only for those whose expectations are ignored, but also for company managers who think they are doing the right thing but are actually being blinded to important material issues. Argues that this is a direct consequence of how values and power are overlooked in corporate citizenship theory and practice, and that one needs to be more open and thoughtful about what expectations can and should be met. Originality/value - These observations in this paper challenge aspects of corporate citizenship's orthodox thinking and require that new consideration be given to the challenge of working with and distinguishing between global communities of need and of expectation. They provide a timely reality check for those propounding and employing popular contemporary approaches to managing the business-society relationship, and at the same time suggest more effective ways of addressing expectation management in the future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Responsibilities; Society",

Specifically, we developed and tested a model linking a related construct, environmental locus of control (ELOC), to a series of pro-environmental behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The context related to various personal and household behaviors vis-à-vis the environment, and the subject pool consisted of a diverse group of urban consumers. A survey was employed to measure various attitudinal and personality variables corresponding to internal/external locus of control, as well as a battery of pro-environmental behaviors. The research propositions were tested using a structural equation modeling approach. Findings - We found four distinct dimensions of ELOC, two of which relate to an external LOC (""biospheric-altruism"" and ""corporate skepticism"") and the other two relate to an internal LOC (""economic motivation"" and ""individual recycling efforts""). We then linked these four dimensions to a variety of pro-environmental behaviors. Highly variable patterns were obtained, with different dimensions assuming a greater or lesser impact, or no role at all, depending on the specific behavior under analysis. Research limitations/implications - Generalizability of the findings is limited due to the sample (urban consumers from one major city), and the method employed (validity of self-report measures and the non-experimental nature of the field study). Practical implications - Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specificity of pro-environmental behaviors, when assessing the antecedent roles of pro-environmental attitudes/dispositions, which are in-and-of-themselves, complex and multidimensional. Originality/value - In this era of environmental degradation, researchers, managers, and public policy makers alike need to consider that pro-environmental attitudes are composed of multiple dispositional facets, and that the role of these facets is highly context-specific. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Green marketing; Social responsibility",

The following article looks at selected results from the most comprehensive survey ever of BiS teaching and research in European academic institutions - undertaken in 2003 by the European Academy of Business in Society and Nottingham University Business School's International Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility (ICCSR), with the support of the European Foundation for Management Development (efmd). The survey found, among other things, that there is a clear demand from business and students for research, education and training on BiS issues; that teaching on the role of BiS is still far from being ""mainstream"" to the business curriculum; and that the diversity of European approaches and terms signal both a strength and a challenge for the BiS debate. The article looks at how a wide range of initiatives are being undertaken by both business schools and business, and often in unique partnerships, to address these challenges and move the BiS research and education agenda forward. Finally, the thorny issue of accreditation is tackled. Improving accreditation processes will play an important part in bringing the business education community up to speed with the new roles and responsibilities they are being asked to fulfill by a wide range of stakeholders (students, society, business and government). As both educators and mediators in the debate, business schools have a valuable contribution to make. In turn, they too are increasingly being made accountable for their own social and environmental impact. The article argues that business schools can choose whether they want to lead, respond, or partner with business to meet these challenges. However, it seems they can no longer afford to ignore it as a passing fad. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business schools; Social responsibility; Stakeholders",

We will specifically study this issue in the context of commercial banks in the financial sector. Financial firms appear to be subject to strong technical and institutional pressures. They are also more opaque and subject to heavier regulation than their non-financial counterparts. It appears that the application of agency-based assumptions to the financial sector is inadequate in explaining corporate governance and related social responsibility practices. In this context, the structure of asymmetric information seems to be more complex and multi-dimensional. It takes place first between the depositors, the bank and the regulatory authorities; second, between the shareholders, the bank and the regulatory authorities; last, between the borrowers, the managers and the regulatory authorities. These parties also constitute the firms' stakeholders. In this respect, the state appears to be a major stakeholder and it is in a position to affect all other bank/stakeholder relations through its regulations and participation in the financial sector. These are the factors that intensify institutional pressures in this sector. The institutional embeddedness inherent in a special context is likely to affect stakeholder position and attitudes. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the conflicting nature of being a stakeholder under institutional pressures and it articulates the factors that determine the behavior of the state as a stakeholder in shaping corporate social responsibility practices of firms. © Emerlad Group Publishing Limited.","Banking; Government; Management theory; Social responsibility; Stakeholders",

It is also rather clear that there is a strong relationship between the stakeholder perspective, and a number of concepts and practices which stress non-financial aspects of company behavior, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability (including environmental respect) and corporate governance. Accordingly, these emerging company ideas and attitudes are here collectively referred to as ""stakeholder responsible (or oriented) approaches"". Current literature underlines especially the importance and difficulty of the implementation phase of these approaches into concrete company actions, but it seems to largely overlook the impact which the reporting process has on both concepts and company actions. On the basis of an ad hoc theoretical model, the paper aims to provide insights into the ""active role"" subtly played by stakeholder oriented reporting (e.g. social and sustainability statements) in constructing and reconstructing the underlying ideas and notions, as well as company behaviors in this field. Far from being a neutral and ""passive"" mirror of the stakeholder responsible approach implemented, reporting carries out the decisive and constitutive role to concretize abstract concepts, and to visualize company activities, thus substantially contributing to make the ""stakeholder philosophy"" viable and reliable. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Reports; Social responsibility; Stakeholders",

Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents the results of a postal survey of supermarket suppliers, which formed part of a wider study of corporate social responsibility in UK supermarket supply chains. Findings - The results demonstrate the heterogeneity in relationships between supermarkets and their suppliers of own-label products in the main commodity sectors the extent to which retail and supply chain strategy is likely to influence the way in which supermarkets deal with suppliers. Best practice was most evident in the two supermarket supply chains where supply base rationalisation has virtually ceased and the adoption of lead suppliers and sole suppliers has been most evident in recent years. Research limitations/implications - Postal survey limited to suppliers in three commodity sectors, where buyer power is greatest. Would expect different results for relationships with branded suppliers. Practical implications - With supermarkets coming under increasing scrutiny over the way they treat suppliers, the conceptual framework and survey instrument represent a mechanism for independent assessment of supply chain relationships in sensitive markets, which could be used constructively to encourage the more widespread adoption of good practice and the elimination of bad practice in supermarket relationships.

Firms that advertise their social and environmental good works in effect solicit charitable contributions from customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. They compete with not-for-prof its in the market to supply public and altruistic goods. To analyze how corporate altruism affects firm valuations, a model is developed in which investors gain utility both from personal consumption and from making donations to worthy causes. A share in a ""responsible"" firm is a charity-investment bundle. When individuals view corporations and not-for-prof its as equally competent suppliers of charity-related ""warm glow,"" small changes in firms' social policies induce exactly offsetting changes in individuals' portfolio choices. There is no effect on firm valuations, and no change in the aggregate supply of good works. When a sizable fraction of investors prefer corporate philanthropy over direct charitable giving (e.g., to avoid taxation of corporate profits), firm valuations will be maximized by following social policies that involve strictly positive levels of corporate altruism.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a short discussion of the characteristics and origins of CSR and this is followed by an outline of the structure of food retailing in the UK and of the ways in which the leading food retailers are driving innovation and development. The paper draws its empirical material from the CSR reports and information posted on the world wide web by the UK's ten leading food retailers. Findings - The findings reveal that each of the leading food retailers has its own approach to CSR and that there are substantial variations in the nature and extent of the reporting process. That said, there is some common ground in reporting on a range of environmental issues, on sourcing, on employees, on customers and on the communities in which the retailers operate. The underlying message is that all food retailers believe that CSR is an integral element of their core business. Originality/value - The paper provides an accessible review of CSR issues and agendas, as perceived by the UK's leading food retailers, and as such will interest academics and practitioners working in and on this sector of the retail marketplace. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Food industry; Retailing; United Kingdom","article; consumer; employee; environmental factor; food industry; food quality; human; social behavior; United Kingdom"

CSR is defined as a programme of actions to reduce externalized costs or to avoid distributional conflicts. It has evolved in response to market failures, a Coasian solution to problems associated with social costs. The analysis suggests that there is a resource-allocation role for CSR programmes in cases of market failure through private-social cost differentials, and also where distributional disagreements are strong. In some sectors of the economy private and social costs are roughly in line and distributional debates are unusual: here CSR has little role to play. Such sectors are outnumbered by those where CSR can play a valuable role in ensuring that the invisible hand acts, as intended, to produce the social good. It can also act to improve corporate profits and guard against reputational risks. © 2005 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR; Environmental responsibility; Risk management; Socially responsible investment; SRI",

Towards a Good Governance in Financial and Insurance Services: the challenge of ethics, transparency and trust"", which took place in Rome, 15 October 2004 and was organized by the MPS insurance pole in partnership with The Geneva Association and Ania. The Forum series are prompted by the awareness of the critical role and nature of the ""paradigms of value"" topic in the present competitive context of financial services. Value-creation mechanisms are key elements of financial and insurance services, both in the interests of shareholders and, in broader terms, of all stakeholders. The theme of the third Montepaschi Vita Forum was encouraged by the current uncertainty of the financial scenario, in which the rule-based system and the reliability and accountability of several interlocutors is being questioned. The basic assumption is that good corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) are gradually advancing from a ""philanthropic"" variant of corporate capitalism to strategic approaches for regaining the trust of clients and society in general. Their role as risk (and also social) managers means that insurers have to work out different models and mechanisms for good corporate governance and CSR in view of a new state of play among the various stakeholders involved. The narrow borderline between legally binding requirements and self-regulatory initiatives has to be borne in mind when addressing topics such as good governance and CSR. A cultural change is involved, transforming a ""regulatory compliance"" approach into a ""regulatory plus"" approach.

This relation is important to evaluate which actions are truly socially responsible and which actions are simply profit maximization in disguise. The available empirical evidence shows that both CG and CSR are positively related to the market value of the firm.

The standards of the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) differ from those of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is also part of the World Bank Group. The major reason for this difference is that these institutions address different negotiating parties in the approval process: while the IBRD and the Ida work with governments, the IFC is responsible for cooperation with the private sector. The Safeguard Policies are complemented by other qualitative standards, and by the setting of limit values and technical specifications, which are established in supplementary but non-binding sets of rules. One such manual of rules, which, like the IFC's Safeguard Policies, is currently undergoing revision, is the Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook.

While focusing on three recent major earthquakes in Turkey, the paper explores the dynamic relationship between state power, corruption, corporate power and, to a limited extent, organized crime in the context of examining responsibility for earthquake-precipitated catastrophe. It documents the 'network of responsibilities, opportunities and pressures' which combine as state crime to create earthquake disasters involving mass human rights violations. The paper argues for a reinterpretation of natural disasters in terms of human rights violations, while developing themes around state culpability which first emerged in an Economic and Social Research Council-funded study undertaken by the author (with Al Hussaini and Curry) on the 1999 Marmara earthquake in Turkey.",,

But good professional quality starts with a sound education. In an attempt to describe the practice of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine in the 15 member states of the »old« European Union, it was noticed that (sometimes) large differences existed in the way professionals are being trained (see: Sanders et al, Clin Chem Lab Med 2002; 40: 196-204). With that outcome, a survey of the Websites of the different Member Societies and Corporate Members of IFCC was conducted. It showed that less than one third of either two groups paid attention to, or offered, education. This led to a series of questions to a non-representative group of colleagues outside the former EU who were willing to give more insight in the educational system of their country. All colleagues were known to be involved actively in clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine. The outcome did not give a uniform pattern, since every country regulates health care in its own way, according to its own historical development, needs, social vision, etc. From that a number of conclusions have been drawn: a. Proper university Training is required to enter vocational training b. Regulated Vocational Training seems to be necessary (4 years) c. A clear Syllabus as an indicative guide to the vocational training is important d. Management training should be included since a clinical chemist will have organizational responsibilities as well e. Examinations may help in improving the quality of the education f. Official Register, recognized by Law, is essential, but not always existing h. Re-Registration can be seen as part of the Quality Cycle. Finally, some attention is being paid to the activities of the EMD. This Division of the IFCC provides the membership of IFCC and the health-care community with education which it considers relevant to Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. It is the intention of EMD to improve the quality of the profession by educational activities in molecular biology, evidence based laboratory medicine, quality assurance, distance education, and laboratory management. Specific projects are a Master Course in Laboratory Science, a course in Flowcytometry, and the Visiting Lecturer Program which supports national societies in inviting lecturers on specific topics. More information can be found on the IFCC Web-site (www.ifcc.org). In the future, it is to be expected that emphasis on education in our profession will be on the clinical use of tests, modern media and e-learning, and specific courses in new technologies. EMD works continuously to improve the quality of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine. The input from all National Societies is appreciated to discern topics most relevant to the membership of IFCC.","Clinical chemistry; Education; IFCC-EMD; Laboratory medicine; Training","chemistry; clinical laboratory; education; European Union; flow cytometry; laboratory personnel; molecular biology; organization; quality control; review; training"

The overarching aim of the discussion is to explore whether Cypriot businesses have realized the opportunity of using CSR to build a strong reputation, a practice ""embraced"" and adopted by many successful and profitable corporations, or whether they ignore their social responsibilities and do it at their peril. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 4,000 questionnaires were given to the Employers Federation in Cyprus to mail to its members. Two issues were addressed: one dealing with philanthropic and the other with the stewardship CSR projects, covering social responsibility not only towards customers and society at large but also towards employees, suppliers, investors, and the environment. Findings - It appears that local corporations primarily emphasize the importance of meeting their responsibilities and obligations towards their employees and customers. The majority of respondents postulate that their philanthropic donations are made to approved organizations for tax deduction. So, financial gain appears to be a key motive for the adoption of social responsibility by the business sector in Cyprus. Research limitations/implications - The study was characterized by a low response rate, which has implications to the generalization of the research findings. Perhaps future research can focus on certain sectors and their approach to the practice of CSR instead of exploring several sectors in the Cypriot economy, which was the approach adopted in this study.

Findings - The short piece by Murray details Gap's decision to publish its own CSR report as part of its strategy to become more transparent and accountable. The article points out the merits of Gap's quest to enhance its reputation but tempers this with the warning that the organization might be leaving itself open to the same charges as Nike before it. The article is supplemented by a brief account of Syngenta's positive action upon discovering that its suppliers were using child labor. An interesting and thought provoking read.

This paper goes beyond the barriers to focus on successful interventions. Design/methodology/approach - Research on leadership issues is reviewed to determine the skills needed to pursue diversity in executive development successfully. Practical application is discussed. Findings - Common barriers to minority advancement include stereotypes about roles and abilities, the scarcity of mentors and personal networks, the lack of significant line experience and visible assignments, and, particularly for women, family responsibilities. Successful intervention methods include holding managers accountable for progress on diversity metrics, and training about diversity and associated attitudes and behaviors. Formal networks, mentoring programs, high potential talent identification and development, and work-life supports can also help an organization's diversity efforts. The creation of a strong business case linking the desired managerial changes to business outcomes is necessary, but research indicates that this may not be enough.

This is directly applicable to North - South supply-chain interactions (private-sector organisations, NGOs, and donors). CSR has adopted techniques from their 'development' usage, yet a reverse flow is not observed back to the 'development' sector. This is unfortunate. Private-sector organisations and NGOs (especially the larger ones) are well placed to take advantage of the increase in CSR relating to developing countries. More importantly, donors of all types would have increased influence if they took up CSR principles. Opportunity costs are not high and the advocacy potential is huge.

Mitchell et al. maintain that the extent to which managers pay attention to the interests of various stakeholder groups is based on the power, legitimacy, and urgency of the claims of each group. Using these attributes of power, legitimacy, and urgency, we analyze how the CSR activities of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, Malden Mills, Inc., and Nova Chemicals Company have changed over time. Our investigation revealed that attributes of stakeholder salience shift over a firm's life cycle, and therefore levels of CSR activities change as well. For these firms, we found that power is the primary attribute of stakeholder salience driving CSR. That is, in order for a firm to engage in purposeful CSR activities, the stakeholder(s) pursuing a CSR agenda must possess the power to impose such an agenda on management. Based on the results of our analysis, we conclude that without power, legitimacy and urgency may not provide sufficient stakeholder salience to promote CSR activities.",,

However, because many developing countries do not have strong human rights, labor, and environmental laws, many multinationals have adopted voluntary corporate responsibility initiatives to self-regulate their overseas social and environmental practices. This article argues that voluntary actions, while important, are insufficient to address the magnitude of problems companies confront as they operate in developing countries where governance is often inadequate. The United States can do more to ensure that its multinationals act responsibly everywhere they operate. First, policymakers should define the social and environmental responsibilities of global companies. They must consistently make their expectations for global business clear - and underscore that this objective can often be accomplished without mandates. Second, the US should closely examine the policies that undermine global Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and address the many conflicting signals sent by policymakers. Third, the President should make the US government a CSR model by examining how to use its purchasing power to promote human rights. Finally, the US government should require pension funds to report on the social and environmental consequences of their investments. In these ways, Americans can mind our business - and thus make sure that US based firms do not undermine social and environmental progress when they operate in the developing world. © Springer 2005.","Economic; Foreign; Global corporate social responsibility; Human rights; Labor standards; Public policies; Sustainability development; Trade",

Community enterprises are distinguished from other third sector organisations by their generation of income through trading, rather than philanthropy and/or government subsidy, to finance their social goals. They also include democratic governance structures which allow members of the community or constituency they serve to participate in the management of the organisation. Partnerships between corporations and community enterprises therefore raise the possibility of corporations moving beyond philanthropic donations toward a more sustainable form of intervention involving long-term commitments to communities. At the same time they change substantively the nature of any collaboration by allowing relationships to proceed on the basis of mutual advantage, thereby broadening their appeal and scope. In doing so, partnerships build capacity and enfranchise communities in a way that avoids the paternalism that has traditionally characterised relationships between corporations and voluntary sector organisations. Power relations are transformed because partners are seen as sources of valuable assets, knowledge and expertise, rather than recipients of patronage or charity. © Springer 2005.","Community enterprise; Corporate legitimacy; Corporate social responsibility; Local accountability; Partnership; Resource dependency; Social enterprise; Stakeholder engagement",

Companies have moved through various phases of response, starting with a 'deny and defend' position, moving to 'paying penance' through donations and philanthropy, and currently settling on risk management through mitigating the negative impacts of their business operations. Drawing on research undertaken by Oxfam International mainly in the retail sector, as well as in the coffee and pharmaceutical sector, this article argues that the current approach is, as yet, inadequate. Simply mitigating negative impacts through castigating intermediaries or suppliers does not contribute to sustainable solutions.

The progress of two convergent design-related threads is charted briefly: the growth, since 1950, of a view that design has a real contribution to make to social responsibility and sustainability; and the increasing evidence of design-like skills being used in development contexts.

The growing commercialization of the classroom is only part of a larger change in thinking about, funding, and reforming public education in America. Schoolhouse commercialism is a reflection of larger economic, social, cultural, and political forces. Whether schools and their students are subordinated to the market place will depend in large measure on how we understand childhood and the proper relationship between adults and the children for whom we are responsible. Despite increased opposition, commercialism in schools is so pervasive that it remains difficult for many people to see. It blends seamlessly with the marketing maelstrom that defines contemporary American culture. In a world in which many parents spend their leisure hours patrolling shopping malls, who arrive home from work exhausted with a bag of fast food under each arm for dinner, whose credit cards always have a balance, and who spend long hours trying to earn the money to pay for the possessions they covet, it may be naïve to think they would be alert to the dangers of marketing to their children in schools. Yet the evidence suggests that parents and ordinary citizens are much more concerned about the corporate exploitation of children in school than the professional educators to whom those children are entrusted. CERU research has, for example, consistently shown that education publications rarely address the issue of school commercialism [16]. Pedagogically, marketing in schools is destructive. Who should students take more seriously - a health and nutrition teacher who encourages them to eat a balanced diet that is low in fat, sugar, and salt or a principal who promotes an exclusive agreement with a bottling company that includes bonuses if students meet certain consumption goals? The curriculum is supposed to represent the essence of a school's purpose. Nevertheless, it is not hard to imagine the ""official"" nutrition lesson being overwhelmed by the ""real world"" example that is provided by the principal. In the ""real world,"" short-term financial gain trumps the long-term health and well-being of students. This is the lesson with which the students likely will walk away. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Meanwhile, China has paid a great cost; e.g. severe environmental deterioration making it one of the most endangered urban and rural environments in the world. In improving the environment, China has taken a number of possible measures including promotion of ISO 14001. To investigate the implementation status of ISO 14001 and its impact on enterprises in China, a structured questionnaire survey has been conducted. The result indicates that the major motivation for the system was to seek entrance to the international market. The other benefits are: standardization of environmental management procedures for internal operations; saving resources and reducing wastage for corporate management; improving corporate image (CI) for marketing effects; enhancing environmental awareness of suppliers for supplier relations. Using relative importance analysis, the study identifies the critical factors affecting implementation of the standards. The top five out of 27 factors are: (1) environmental consciousness of top leaders; (2) environmental consciousness of middle management; (3) well-defined responsibility for environmental management; (4) legal system; and (5) legal enforcement.

Design/methodology/approach - Focus groups were conducted to clarify themes and inform a questionnaire on fast-food purchasing behaviours and motives. Attitude statements were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis. Findings - Most respondents (82 per cent) regularly purchased fast food from one of the companies; purchases were mostly impulsive (57 per cent) or routine (26 per cent), suggesting relatively low-level involvement in each case. While there was scepticism regarding the CSR activity being promoted, expectations about socially responsible behaviour by the companies were nevertheless high. Four factors were isolated, together explaining 52 per cent of the variance in fast-food purchasing behaviour. They were brand value, nutritional value, ethical value and food quality. Research limitations/implications - The research was conducted with students, and while these represent a key-target market, any further research should target a more diverse public. Practical implications - There are important implications for global fast-food companies in terms of protecting and developing their brand value; they need to respond to the wider food-related debates in society, in particular, those concerning healthy eating and food ethics. They also need to ensure that their business practices are fully consistent with the values expressed in their CSR initiatives. Originality/value - The special value of the paper lies in its joining together of current perspectives on CSR and consumer value in the UK food industry as it explores both through the perceptions of young consumers of fast food. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Consumer behaviour; Fast foods; United Kingdom","article; catering service; consumer; factorial analysis; feeding behavior; food industry; food quality; information processing; nutritional value; questionnaire; social behavior; United Kingdom; Gallus gallus"

The article is based on an extensive twelve-month research project on the Gulf of Guinea region funded by the Nuffield Foundation. This research identified a number of constraints to a developmental role for CSR: the subservience of CSR schemes to corporate objectives; country- and context-specific issues; the failure to involve the beneficiaries of CSR; the lack of human resources; technical/managerial approaches of company staff and the lack of CSR's integration into larger development plans. But even if private companies were able to overcome practical problems, it argues that the current CSR agenda fails to address the crucial issues of governance and the negative macro-level effects that multinational companies cause in host countries. The article concludes by suggesting that a focus on CSR may divert attention from broader political, economic and social solutions for developmental problems.",,

But who does it benefit and in what ways? Most importantly, does it allow certain interest groups to redefine the meaning of international development success? This article examines the historical relationship between business and development and compares how expectations of business as exemplified through CSR practices differ from those in the past. It then looks at the role and expectations of business in developing countries and proposes two tests for assessing if CSR makes a positive contribution to development goals based on whether it redefines the meaning of good business practice in the interests of the poor and marginalized, and if it helps development practitioners to manage more effectively the possibility and consequences of global capitalism for poor countries. The article argues that the interests of business are not adequately aligned with those of the poor, and explains why CSR does little to redress this. It argues that the business case in some instances overrides the developmental case for certain actions, and that business thinking is increasingly evident in the policies and practices of international development. Although CSR may have a positive contribution to make in some circumstances, its limitations need to be understood if development's case for involving business is not to be subsumed by business reasons for engaging with (and by-passing) developing countries.",,

It then describes the factors that have led to the recent emphasis given to CSR by both bilateral and multilateral development agencies and the United Nations. A framework for analysing the links between foreign direct investment and poverty is developed focusing on the impacts on the poor as producers, consumers and beneficiaries of government expenditures. This framework is used to illustrate the limitations of CSR. in terms of likely impacts on poverty reduction through each of the channels identified and also to point to areas in which CSR may have some positive benefits. Overall, the article concludes that it is unlikely to play the significant role in poverty reduction in development countries that its proponents claim for it.",,

A notional continuum for locating corporate financial reporting (CFR) and corporate governance (CG) responsibilities alongside potential corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting and stakeholder value creation (SVC) requirements is developed. The urgency for such an integrative perspective arises from the swiftly expanding scholarly research relating to corporate responsibilities. These academic exhortations are framed as inert and independent domains of discourse, given the absence of a wider connecting framework, to link what are in effect, closely related issues. The broad argument advanced is that CFR, CG, CSR, and SVC need to be notionally integrated into a spectrum of corporate disclosure responsibility, so that debates on conformance and performance reporting issues can be articulated in a comprehensively interlinked manner rather than disparately. The paper also addresses issues relating to the mandatory reporting, articulation and promulgation of CSR and SVC standards, in the light of the notional continuum posited. Some implications of the continuum are discussed, including the need to qualify calls which have been made in the recent past for differentiating between financial and management accounting practices. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The Corporate Social Responsibility discourse has been promoted by business lobbies, emphasizing the role of international companies in voluntarily contributing towards the solution of pressing social and environmental problems through partnerships with other stakeholders. The notion of corporate accountability has become the rallying point for sustainable development, demanding stricter regulation of corporate behaviour by national governments and the enactment of an international corporate accountability convention. This article assesses the promises and pitfalls of these two competing approaches to industries in South Africa. The article argues that a multi-level approach is necessary to the impact of CSR and corporate accountability initiatives. It concludes that CSR may improve environmental management systems and reduce corporate pollution levels whereas corporate accountability approaches may provide important incentives for companies to improve their environmental performance, assist in the development of national environmental governance frameworks guiding company-community interaction, and facilitate the enforcement of national legislation pertaining to corporate responsibility. However, both approaches fail to address the underlying, global-level structural causes of conflicts between companies and stakeholders affected by their operations.

Liberal notions of CSR place great emphasis on voluntary, partnership and market-based approaches to tackling social and environmental problems and managing conflict. While the rise of voluntary standards and codes of conduct in the North and the growing popularity of various forms of 'civil regulation' has improved the responsiveness of corporations to social and environmental issues, there are doubts about their transferability or relevance in many southern settings. This is particularly so when viewed from the perspective of communities pursuing corporate accountability in the absence of donor, NGO or government pressure for company reform. It is in these 'majority world' settings that we encounter the limits of the liberal CSR agenda. This article therefore explores the different tools that poorer communities have developed in order to construct mechanisms of corporate accountability. Recent work in India is drawn upon to ground the analysis, but reference is made to many other cases in different regions of the world and across a variety of sectors. It is suggested that many state-based, community-based and company-based factors determine the likely success of such initiatives. Power disparities and how to contest them emerge as key, however, and their neglect within mainstream CSR approaches undermines their ability to address issues of corporate accountability in situations characterized by sharp inequities in power. The emphasis here is on the process of promoting corporate accountability, and the relations of power that underpin these, rather than the achievement of more narrowly defined indicators of corporate performance.",,

The findings suggest that BP's awareness of the relationship between socially responsible investment and reputation, linked to their desire to have a positive impact on the societies in which they operate, mean that CSR is an important component of their business strategy. However, while BP perceive CSR as having a positive effect on their expansion into new territories and the host country may require licence bids to include social and environmental factors, these are secondary to operational performance and technical capacity in determining licence awards.

As hypothesized, we found a significant relationship between the long-term compensation and total CSR weakness as well as the product/environmental weakness dimension of CSR. In addition, we found a marginally significant relationship between long-term compensation and total corporate responsibility.

It is a voluntary form of self-regulation that aims to tackle everything from human rights and labour standards to limiting carbon dioxide emissions that lead to climate change. But because CSR ultimately lies within the framework of markets, and requires market-based incentives for companies to invest in such programmes, it ultimately falls prey to the vagaries of the market. The myths of CSR include that voluntary reporting improves performance; that codes and management systems change corporate behaviour; the consumer will drive change and that the investment community will provide the best incentive for business to perform in a more sustainable manner. Re-envisioning ethical business requires us to look at opportunities below the radar screen: not at minimising the impacts of big business.

This paper aims to review these changes and their implications in order to understand better the likely future expectations of business in society and the way in which leading companies are setting new standards of responsible business practice. It begins by tracing trends within corporate social responsibility debates, and then draws on empirical research and observed stakeholder demands of business, to argue that the boundaries of corporate responsibility are advancing both internally and externally. Internally, these boundaries are changing in terms of the increased responsibility of corporations towards their direct and indirect internal stakeholders. This is shown through innovations in business practice to achieve enhanced social justice in the workplace, improved governance, and more accurate disclosure of non-financial risk. This paper provides a context for this discussion by examining emerging international law, guidelines and voluntary initiatives, regulatory frameworks, and risk review procedures that increasingly seek to redefine corporate responsibility by establishing new norms of best practice and behaviour. These boundaries are also expanding externally, as society increasingly expects global business to work with others to provide solutions to humanitarian crises and endemic problems facing the world. This paper explores how some companies are doing this by applying core competencies in ways that integrate social development and business goals. It suggests, in turn, that the challenges of these expanding boundaries of responsibilities are best addressed through strategic partnerships. This paper concludes that there are new multi-stakeholder convened global governance frameworks evolving that are encouraging businesses of the future to re-invent themselves as a 'force for positive good' in society. This involves going beyond the paradigm of simply 'doing no harm', and way beyond previous expectations of business as being only about shareholder value. This prediction is supported by examples drawn from the practice of global companies that are already innovating to fulfil this wider role. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"business; corporate strategy; ethics; strategic approach"

Its relevance in everyday business is determined by the moral values of the company culture. In this context, governance is defined as a company's resources and capabilities, including the moral resources, to take on responsibility for all its stakeholders. A critical discussion of the agency theory, transaction cost theory, and organization theory shows that such an approach is possible only when a company is not perceived as a maximizing machine for shareholders' interests but as an economic form of cooperation of internal and external resources and stakeholders. An empiric study on 22 European corporate governance codes shows that the predominant majority of European codes orientate themselves to stakeholders and the company. The discussion of the empirical data reveals six basic principles that determine all European corporate governance codes: shareholder rights, transparency, voting rights, regulation of remuneration, design of organizational structures, and corporate social responsibility. © 2005 Sage Publications.","Cooperation; Corporate governance; Moral resources; Stakeholder",

Ethics auditing is understood as the opportunity and agreement to devise a system to inform on ethical corporate behavior. This system essentially aims to increase the transparency and credibility of the company's commitment to ethics. At the same time, the process of elaborating this system allows us to introduce the moral dimension into company actions and decisions, thereby completing a key dimension of the production, maintenance and development of trust capital. To this end, the following four steps are taken. First, we analyze the relation between ethics auditing and trust as a basic moral resource in the dialogue between the company and its various stakeholders. Second, we examine the social balance sheet as a precursor to ethics auditing and focus on what prevents it from going further. Third, we attempt to reconstruct the basic moral assumptions underlying the company's social responsibility from the discourse ethics approach. Finally, we present a methodological framework from which to carry out our proposal, which embraces two basic theoretical perspectives stakeholder theory and the values derived from discourse ethics as a normative framework. © Springer 2005.","Business dialogue; Corporate social responsibility; Discourse ethics; Ethics audit; Stakeholder approach; Trust",

While uncertainty has always been a constant of human life, the paper argues that due to technological and social developments, risk and uncertainty are going to be defining features that companies of the future will have to deal with. Given that almost all managerial and organisational decisions have moral consequences, the question is how companies can and should act. The paper suggests that one possible way in which moral challenges under risk and uncertainty can be addressed is the concept of responsibility. It demonstrates that there is a close affinity between responsibility and uncertainty on the one hand and between responsibility and business on the other. However, the traditional concept of responsibility has severe limitations that preclude it from being applied successfully. In order to overcome the weaknesses of traditional responsibility a reflective notion of responsibility is developed. Reflective responsibility is the attempt to apply its defining features, which are openness, teleology, and consequentialism, onto itself. The theory of reflective responsibility is then developed and, by using an example, it is demonstrated that it corresponds well with participative management strategies. The paper concludes that reflective responsibility overcomes the weaknesses of traditional concepts of responsibility and at the same time retains their strength of being able to deal with uncertainty. The theory of reflective responsibility therefore offers a plausible course of action for companies that want to be the ethical companies of the future. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Medicaid as a state and federal aid program in the United States and economic development programs as foreign aid provide useful analogies specifically because they exhibit a variety of parallel patterns. The increasing concatenation of corporate interests with state and nongovernmental interests in aid programs is ultimately producing a less centralized system of power and responsibility. This process of decentralization, however, is not undermining the sources of power behind aid efforts, although it does make the connections between intent, planning, and outcome less direct. Ultimately, the devolution of power produces many unintended consequences for aid policy.

The basic material was gathered from four case mills and their surroundings in four countries: China, Finland, Germany and Portugal. The stakeholders in the case companies determined the priorities among the acceptability criteria by means of pairwise comparisons, after which a prioritisation function, i.e. the weights on the criteria, was estimated using regression techniques. The resulting stakeholders' valuations were compared cross-culturally and intra-culturally. Technical, financial and environmental issues were perceived as the most relevant elements of the acceptability of operations, and thus of corporate social performance. Despite the common elements identified, the present findings indicated that the concept of the acceptability of operations varies from place to place. It was obvious that national and company culture influenced the elements that were emphasised at a particular time, although all background factors could not be studied statistically in the present context. The variability in the concept of acceptability makes the definition of CSP difficult even within one branch of industry, not to mention providing a general definition for all business. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports on the outputs from this project, which placed 109 disadvantaged job seekers into positions at the store, and proved particularly effective at targeting the long-term unemployed and those with limited experience of the retail sector. The analysis is based on the findings of survey research undertaken with 86 of the 109 training course completers (a 79 per cent response rate) and all the main partners involved in the Initiative. Innovative elements of the training programme that contributed to its positive outcomes are discussed, and a model for 'managing successful partnerships' is applied, in order to identify critical factors explaining the apparent success of the Initiative. In particular, the importance of employers providing job guarantees is noted.","Corporate social responsibility; Employability; Job guarantees; Partnerships; Regeneration; Service work",

Namely, that corporate global rule is already here. Positive evidence abounds. Multinational corporations (MNCs) dominate the global economy, accounting for two-thirds of global trade in goods and services. Of the one hundred largest world economies, fifty-one are corporations. The top two hundred corporations generate 27.5 percent of the world gross domestic product and their combined annual revenues are greater than those of the 182 states that contain 80 percent of the world population. The combined sales of four of the largest corporations in the world exceed the gross domestic product of the whole of Africa (Chomsky 2002; Davidsson 2002; Ellwood 2002). Economic figures tell only part of the story. As a result of their vast wealth, MNCs have accumulated significant political and cultural powers as well. Economic globalization and trade liberalization have given them powers that match and often surpass that of national governments. In rich and poor countries alike, albeit in different ways, MNCs often enjoy decisive powers to shape public policy, to encourage or bar legislative measures, to promote or discourage social reforms, and to influence governmental action in key areas including employment, the environment, and social and civil rights. As corporations emerge as global private authorities, and as governments undergo structural adjustments, “we are back to the independent realm of economic action as a major locus of political power” (Beck, Giddens, and Lash 1994). © Cambridge University Press 2005 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,

The next question asked is why development may command only a small share of charitable donations and how people determine the objects of their giving; here the economic literature on philanthropy provides only limited help and the discussion draws on the literature on donor behaviour from other disciplines, notably marketing. The special case of private donations to the UN agencies is then considered, looking at the particular problems faced by the UN, and focusing on the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which is by far the most successful UN agency at collecting money from private individuals; the question is asked as to whether private donations are crowded-out by governmental contributions or by Official Development Assistance (ODA). The last main section of the chapter discusses future prospects and ways forward, including measures designed to promote charitable donations, in general, but focusing on their particular relevance for development. It covers the issue of tax incentives to donors, the new 'global funds' (intended partly to attract money from the super-rich), new forms of corporate social responsibility and giving in relation to 'cause-related marketing', the use of the Internet, and long-term donor education. © Oxford University Press, 2013.","Cause-related marketing; Charitable donations; Corporate donations; Corporate social responsibility; Development funding; Donor education; Global funds; Household income; Industrialised countries; Internet; Marketing; Philanthropy; Private donations; Superrich; Tax incentives; UN agencies; UNICEF; United nations; United nations children's fund",

There has been much debate, and mixed empirical findings, regarding whether socially responsible behavior on the part of companies improves or reduces firm performance. Design/methodology/ approach - A survey methodology and structural equation modeling are used to assess the relationship between PSR and supplier performance, including the mediating role of organizational learning. The theoretical scope is developed through an integration of literature from logistics, corporate social responsibility, the resource-based view of the firm, and organizational learning. Findings - No direct relationship is found between PSR and costs; however, organizational learning and supplier performance act as key, mediating variables between PSR and costs, with PSR leading to organizational learning, improved supplier performance, and ultimately reduced costs. Research limitations/implications - The significant mediating roles of organizational learning and supplier performance provide one possible explanation for the past, conflicting findings of studies that have investigated the direct relationship between corporate social responsibility and firm performance. Practical implications - The findings suggest that PSR not only is the ""right thing to do"", but also can lead to significant improvements in supplier performance and costs.

They do not know how to respond to the rising social and environmental requirements of global buyers and supply chains and fear that were they to do so they would lose their competitive edge. However, they are aware that if they do not meet these requirements, they will not be able to access new foreign markets and may lose the contracts they already have. To investigate whether practical methods exist for resolving this dilemma, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) carried out a one year project with 22 SMEs in four Asian countries. The results suggest that well targeted, enterprise-specific efforts to meet corporate social responsibility (CSR) requirements can make a positive contribution to both short-term profitability and longer-term competitiveness. The 'business case' for CSIR appears strongest in the environmental area, but measures in that area can act as a 'starter motor' for tackling more systemic 'social' problems. Furthermore, tackling social issues at the workplace can feed back positively to improve the sustainability of the environmental improvement measures.

The notion of capability which was developed first by Lancaster (1966) and then Sen (1985, 1999) in the context of welfare economics, has more recently come to prominence in the debate over European social and economic policy, as a result of its use in the Supiot report on the transformation of work and employment relations (Salais 1999; Supiot 1999). We will argue here that the particular importance of the capability concept lies in its potential to clarify the relationship between social rights and the market order, as expressed in the discourse of European integration. We begin by revisiting T. H. Marshall's classic analysis of social rights and their ambiguous relationship to the market (Marshall [1949] 1992). We then introduce Sen's capability approach and discuss how far it provides a framework for locating social rights within a market setting. We argue that Sen's non-dogmatic, context-oriented approach to defining the meaning of capabilities offers a viable way forward for thinking about the current tension between market rights and social rights in the European Union. This argument is illustrated by reference to the role played by mechanisms of corporate social responsibility in promoting gender equality. Social rights: ‘Social rights’ are usually understood as claims on resources in the form of income, services or employment. In T. H. Marshall's classic and still influential formulation, social rights were distinguished from ‘civil’ and ‘political’ rights. © Cambridge University Press, 2004.",,

Here, we focus on a large infrastructure development in sub-Saharan Africa, namely the Chad-Cameroon petroleum development and pipeline project. We adapted a five-step process for HIA, consisting of (1) screening of project documents, (2) profiling of affected communities, (3) identifying priority health areas, predicting potential impacts, and proposing mitigation measures, (4) implementing interventions, and (5) monitoring and evaluation of health impacts. We found that project scoping was broad, including extensive environmental and social assessments. Innovative features of the project include the high degree of public-private partnerships, and the management of oil revenues for purposes of poverty reduction. The project also addressed occupational and public health issues, and developed and implemented measures to prevent or mitigate potential health impacts. However, there was a disproportionate emphasis on workers' health, particularly on the prevention/mitigation of construction-related injuries, sexually transmitted infections (STIs; mainly HIV/AIDS), and malaria. Health impacts among surrounding communities, and cumulative health impacts in the larger region were not considered in a comprehensive way. Concluding, there is a need for a more systemic approach to HIA and its incorporation within 'Equator Principles', which are increasingly adopted by the international financial community. This process would include clarification of corporate social responsibility beyond the project fence line in the mitigation of health problems at regional levels. Finally, we propose the establishment and running of a longitudinal demographic surveillance system, which - coupled with regular household surveys - would facilitate monitoring and evaluation of impacts on health, social wellbeing and equity in the broadest possible manner. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

They argue that it is hard to reconcile democracy with the private discretion that always accompanies the discharge of responsibilities that are not judicially enforceable. There are two ways of constructing this argument: the ""perfect-market argument"" and the ""social-power argument."" This paper demonstrates that the perfect-market argument is untenable and that the social-power argument is sometimes valid. It also asserts that the proponents of the perfect-market argument are mistaken in their assumption that perfect markets are conducive to democracy. There are strong reasons to hold that perfect markets are undesirable from a democratic point of view. A proper conceptualization and differentiation of the relation between ""the private and the public"" can make this clear. The proponents of the social-power argument sometimes maintain that the democratic deficit can be compensated for by consulting the stake-holders affected. Against this, I will argue that the social power argument has nothing to offer affected parties. Still, it will be shown that modern theory on corporate social responsibility is not well accommodated to the democratic deficit as revealed by the social power argument.",,

Although the mainstream of current thinking in business ethics recognizes that a firm should invest in social responsibility, the normative theory on how specific competitive conditions affect a firm's social responsibility remains underdeveloped. Intensity of competition, risks to reputation and the regulatory environment determine the competitive conditions of a firm. Our central thesis is that differential strength of competition produces differential moral legitimacy of firm behavior. When competition is fierce or weak, different acts or strategies become morally acceptable, as well as economically rational.

This article also explores the influence of the newly developed 'codes of conducts' from Western buyers. In the survey of three companies which are required to follow the codes of conduct by buyers trade unions had no more freedom than those in companies without codes of conduct. The paper discusses the implications of this research offering strategies for labor rights improvements. © 2005 Springer.","Codes of conduct; Corporate social responsibility; Global production chains; Labor rights; Taiwan; Trade union; Vietnam",

This study aims to use a multilevel framework to assess the extent to which LEAs differentially affect the provision of resources and administrative services to schools, and the differential extent to which organizational effectiveness and LEAs' corporate social capital account for between-LEA variation in these outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - Using an Israeli national sample of 464 schools in 76 LEAs, the study uses an HLM methodology to test which of the two theoretical models best fits the data. Findings - The analysis reveals that background characteristics of a locale are not related to administrative services and resources that LEAs provide to schools in their jurisdiction. In contrast, LEAs do differentially affect these services and resources, with the variables of organizational effectiveness accounting for most of the observed inter-LEA inequalities. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on cross-sectional design, therefore precludes any causal definitive conclusions. Originality/value - The study concludes by suggesting that inequalities in LEAs' organizational capacities trickle down to the school level and LEAS are important organizational units in any attempt to curb inequality of service to students. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decentralized control; Israel; Local authorities; Schools",

This paper describes the board self-evaluation process used by Bayside Health, a public health service in Melbourne. The question of how governing boards can assess their performance has received increasing attention over the past decade. In particular, the increasing demand for accountability to shareholders and regulators experienced by corporate sector Boards has resulted in greater scrutiny of board performance, with the market and the balance sheet providing some basis for assessment. Performance evaluation of governing boards in the public sector has been more challenging. Performance evaluation is complex in a sector that is not simply driven by the bottom line, where the stakeholders involve both government and the broader community, and where access to, and the quality and safety of the services provided, are often the major public criteria by which performance may be judged. While some practices from the corporate sector can be applied successfully in the public sector, this is not always the case, and public sector boards such as the Board of Directors of Bayside Health have been developing ways to evaluate and improve their performance.",,"article; Australia; board of trustees; human; organization and management; public health; public health service; social behavior; standard; Efficiency, Organizational; Governing Board; Humans; National Health Programs; Public Health Administration; Social Responsibility; Victoria"

To promote successful careers in dental education, prospective and new dental faculty should possess a realistic view of the dental school work environment, akin to the informed consent so valuable to patients and doctors. Self-assessment of personal strengths and weaknesses provides helpful information in matching faculty applicants with appropriate dental schools. Essential prehiring information also includes a written job description detailing duties and responsibilities, professional development opportunities, and job performance evaluation protocol. Prehiring awareness of what constitutes excellence in job performance will aid new faculty in allotting time to productive venues. New faculty should not rely solely on professional expertise to advance careers. Research and regular peer-reviewed publications are necessary elements in academic career success, along with the ability to secure governmental, private foundation, and corporate grant support. Tactful self-promotion and self-definition to the dental school community are faculty responsibilities, along with substantial peer collaboration. The recruitment period is a singular opportunity to secure job benefits and privileges. It is also the time to gain knowledge of institutional culture and assess administrative and faculty willingness to collaborate on teaching, research, professional development, and attainment of change.

Using a sample of 394 SR firms and comparing these to a matched sample of firms, I find that SR firms have characteristics associated with effective board structures. For instance, SR firms have more outsiders and women directors, and less instance of CEO/Chairman duality than non-SR firms. Results are similar when using a continuous measure of social responsibility. Also, I document that SR firms have higher Governance Index scores than the matched sample. Overall, this suggests that a reason for shareholders' appeal in socially responsible firms and mutual funds may be because these firms have stronger governance mechanisms in place than do non-SR firms. In addition, it appears that effective governance structures are more likely to exist in firms that focus on a broad range of stakeholders, rather than in firms that have a strict focus on shareholder wealth maximization.","agency theory; boards of directors; corporate governance; social responsibility; socially responsible investing",

The corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports which have now become an annual report in addition to the traditional annual financial reports is one of the vehicles used to demonstrate how caring they have been over the financial period that has just ended and how they intend to continue to be even more so in future periods. The study looks at CSR reports of different companies across different industries in the UK. Notes that there are two distinct practices adopted when reporting on CSR matters. Some companies issue separate reports for their CSR activities whilst others devote a section in their annual reports for providing information on these activities. Also notes that all companies in the survey recognise the enormous benefits that can emanate from making known their CSR policies and activities.

They focused on two issues: assessing the added value of corporate social responsibility and implementing a structured approach. The Dutch experiment showed that the companies involved were able to specify the added value of CSR by elaborating the economic performance and/or parenting advantage. Unfortunately, a third type of value creation, viz. through protecting the company's reputation, was not elaborated. Moreover, the experiment revealed that among the 19 participating companies experiences were limited in implementing a structured approach towards CSR. By exchanging experiences the companies learned from each other. Such interactive learning turned out to be a helpful support, complementary to the general CSR literature on guidelines, indicators and best practice guides.

The paper questions how change agents promoting CSR within these companies made sense of the meaning of CSR. How did they use language (and other instruments) to stimulate and underpin the contextual essence of CSR? Why did they do that in this particular way? What were the consequences of this approach for shaping the process of CSR in their company? Did their efforts contribute to a new way of thinking and acting or was it merely putting old wine in new barrels? A preliminary conclusion is that change agents use above all linguistic artefacts (words and notions) and carry out practical projects while constructing meaning.

What type of government intervention is more effective in fostering CSR among companies? This paper is an attempt to answer these questions, reviewing the debate between proponents of the voluntary case and the obligatory case for CSR, and critically analysing current international government-led initiatives to foster CSR among companies, and national government-led initiatives in the EU area. Finally, the paper focuses on the Spanish case, as an example of the failure of an exclusively voluntary approach. Despite the rapid uprise of CSR, Spain is still far behind late in CSR promotion strategies. Most action has been undertaken by companies themselves with no common guidelines, governmental support, or independent verification. The lack of a regulatory framework for CSR or ethical investment issues and the virtual absence of other indirect incentives, explains the misbalance between private, public and Third Sector initiatives. Based on the Spanish context which is quite similar to other non-OECD countries, the authors call for a more proactive government position in CSR related issues.

Recent case studies and research experiences show that social and environmental targets are more widely recognized as strategic drivers for management. However, experiments also show that the traditional Scorecard has its limits when it comes to e.g. stakeholder management and product chain management. The European Corporate Sustainability Framework (ECSF) program distinguishes several ambition levels for Corporate Sustainability/Corporate Responsibility. The traditional Balanced Scorecard is suitable for companies that aim for Compliance-driven CS/CR or for Profit-driven CS/CR, where the financial bottom line is the ultimate indicator for success. More ambitious companies want to balance economic, social and ecological targets in a Community-driven CS/SR or Synergy-driven CS/CR. For ambitious companies, we propose a format of a Responsive Business Scorecard (RBS). The Responsive Scorecard enables companies to score at Profit, People and Planet, at the same time to integrate stakeholder demands into internal programs to improve performance. The RBS includes five Perspectives: Customers & Suppliers, Financiers & Owners, Society & Planet, Internal Process and Employees & Learning. We assessed the practical feasibility of a Responsive Scorecard in food and tourist industries. In the food industry, we analyzed whether existing business priorities of Italian companies can adequately fill a Responsive scorecard. Our conclusion is that traditional topics like finance, customers and employees are readily filled, but that sustainability topics like chain management (suppliers) and environmental performance (planet) need further elaboration. The tourist sector is dominated by Small and Medium Sized Enterprises. We investigated whether existing eco-labels for camping-sites and marinas can be developed into Responsive Scorecards. Our conclusion is that such a sector specific development of a Responsive Scorecard is possible.

Corporate SD, sometimes referred to as ""Corporate Social Responsibility"" and/or ""Corporate Citizenship"", is a term used to describe companies concerned with social and environmental needs in addition to conventional business economics. SD further involves optimizing short-term goals balanced against long-term needs. A discussion covers the background of corporate SD; three significant factors that drive the SD movement in global corporations, i.e., societal activism and mobilization, regulatory drivers and governance issues, and precedent and perceived benefits by the companies themselves; and Royal Dutch Shell and BP case studies. The success of the projects examined in this case study, in spite of the difference in company styles, shows that there is no ""cookie cutter"" approach to SD. The execution of an individual project depends heavily on the historical perception of stakeholders. These two companies were starting from a different datum. It required Shell to focus more on brand redemption than BP. According to the leaders of BP and Shell, SD is expected to benefit their companies mainly through their license to operate (LTO) and risk reduction. They have already seen the benefits of reduced risk in the form of reduced project delays through improved community relations.

It has also become more external: people outside management who are affected by management's decisions increasingly have a voice in, if not a veto over, these decisions, and have access to the technology that enables them to have that voice heard globally. Historically, companies have tried to deal with their external environment by adding specific staff functions to respond to particular 'threats' as they emerged. The authors argue that a more proactive approach is needed to adapt to the new reality of business in a global world. After analysing several cases that laid out important historical antecedents spanning the last 30 years, the authors suggest a new paradigm-based on open systems theory for conceptualizing and organizing the corporate external affairs activities.",,

The company had made some deliberate attempts to link environmental and social responsibility issues. However, this integration was partial and contested within the company. The case shows that dealing with environmental soundness and starting to integrate environmental and social issues and management need not be a sequential process. Institutional and wider social factors are shown to play a strong role in influencing company thinking and actions in this area, seemingly sending rather mixed signals in this case. The case also highlights the role of sustainability champions in making links between the organization's business purpose, its environmental performance and its social responsibility in terms of the long term sustainability of the region and the company's future.

The study is, in part, an experimental test of image restoration strategies conceptualized in the literature. Each of the three factors was found to exhibit a significant main effect. For the crisis scenario used in this study, responsibility explained the largest proportion of variance and response explained the least. An unexpected finding was that an inappropriate response by a ""bad"" company resulted in an increase in regard toward the firm, whereas the same response by a ""good"" company resulted in a decrease in regard for the firm. © 2004 by the Association for Business Communication.","Attribution theory; Corporate image; Crisis communication; Fairness theory; Negative publicity",

This has caused a crisis of trust in the public and lead to much discussion on ways to prevent such unethical behavior by adopting new approaches through legislation and the structure of corporations. This article is not about introducing a new approach to corporate ethics and governance as there is much change already taking place. The National Quality Institute (NQI) in Canada offers a demonstrated and proven way, through the application of the Excellence Frameworks, of providing for good corporate guidance and ethical leadership practices. Organizations, which adopt a strategic focus on Excellence, attain great results and become healthy organizations, as their leaders understand the dynamic relationship and the balance that exists between ""employees, customers, and stakeholders"". These organizations build trust by acting responsibly. NQI works with many organizations in Canada that have a strategic leadership focus on organizational excellence utilizing the criteria in the NQI Canadian Excellence Frameworks for Quality and for Healthy Workplace. Organizations that take an integrated approach to Excellence also perform well in such areas as corporate social responsibility, employee health and customer satisfaction. This article has specific references to three organizations that have achieved Canada's prime recognition the Canada Awards for Excellence (CAE).","Canada; Excellence; Healthy workplace; Quality; Social responsibility",

The historic and possibly arcane purpose of business, to maximise shareholder wealth, is no longer a relevant proposition. Academics and managers need to rethink the philosophical framework of management theory. For the past 50 years the management literature has adopted a more ""human"" approach to the management of organisations yet the importance of systems and process and performance measurers associated with the scientific theory of management prevails. With the growing importance of knowledge creation and the corporate social responsibility movement it is timely to reflect on the purpose of business as adding value to society and rejecting the focus on accumulation of personal wealth. Knowledge-creating enterprises are founded on the development of sustainable relationships within the organisation and with stakeholders and thus require a different philosophical perspective.","Management theory; Philosophy; Social responsibility",

Design: Analysis of tobacco industry document files to date available only on-site at the Guildford Depository operated by BAT. An additional search of recent documents related to BAT, placed in the Minnesota Depository, was also carried out. Results: BAT has been committed to regaining its historically dominant position in China since the country reopened to foreign companies in 1979. Initially, BAT remained cautious relative to competitors in seeking joint ventures, finding market access hindered by bureaucratic complexity, restrictions on foreign investment and imports quotas, and later an advertising ban. Instead, the documents suggest BAT strongly relied on illegal imports to expand market presence of State Express 555 and other key brands. It was only when risks to contraband sales increased that the company made greater efforts to establish a legal presence in the country. Attempts to stress the long history of BAT in China and a proclaimed commitment to corporate social responsibility have been used to facilitate later negotiations. Conclusion: China has remained relatively closed to transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) during its transition to a market economy, maintaining a firm grip over foreign investment and imports. Nonetheless, BAT has circumvented such restrictions through illegal imports and exploitation of inconsistencies in the local enforcement of advertising bans. Governments need to understand and address the full range of market entry tactics by TTCs in order to ensure effective tobacco control.",,"advertizing; China; conference paper; control; government; human; law; market; marketing; tobacco industry; Advertising; China; Commerce; Crime; Government; Humans; Marketing; Organizational Objectives; Politics; Public Health; Public Policy; Social Responsibility; Tobacco Industry"

The determinants of corporate charitable donations are explored within a stakeholder model and the relationship between corporate charitable donations and a set of firm and industry variables is estimated using OLS. Particular emphasis is placed on industry effects and the impact of social and environmental stakeholders. The results highlight a significant change in behaviour between 1989-90 and 1998-99 that may reflect a strategic response by corporate decision-makers to external concerns over corporate social responsibility. In the early period corporate charitable donations were substantially determined by profits. However, this relationship has weakened during the 1990s as firms have become increasingly responsive to stakeholder influences. The results for the later period emphasize the increasing importance of corporate visibility, and the development of social and environmental influences on corporate charitable contributions.",,

Three categories of voluntary disclosure are developed (namely, corporate environment, social responsibility and finance-related disclosures) and each category is tested for association with seven company-specific variables (corporate size, gearing, profitability, liquidity, industry, share return and listing status) in the annual reports of 87 companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE).

The United States is in the midst of historic experiments with publicly funding school choice in K-12 education. Other nations have long experience with the funding and regulation of nonpublic schools (as we would call them), including religious schools. What, we wanted to know, can U.S. policymakers, public officials, and citizens learn from those experiences? In particular, we wanted to know how other countries have regulated or structured public funding of educational choice with an eye not just toward improving test scores and the like, but also toward instilling civic values in students-for example, tolerance, civic cohesion, and democratic values such as integration across lines of class, religion, and race. Do other countries take seriously the sorts of civic anxieties that are widely voiced by opponents of school choice in the United States? What is their experience with vouchers or other forms of publicly subsidized educational choice? Is publicly funding parental choice a source of civic conflict? Do public funds flow to separatist or just plain weird schools? How do other countries strike a balance between parental choice, educational pluralism, and school competition on the one hand and the publics concern with common citizenship, tolerance, and the integration of social, ethnic, and religious groups on the other? In posing these questions we did not expect contributors to produce simple policy ""lessons"" as if they were cases of French wine or boxes of Belgian chocolate to be packaged for export to the United States. Nevertheless, like untold other students of public policy, we wished this time to heed the admonitions of our colleagues who study education from a comparative perspective and learn from the experience of other democracies abroad. We were far from disappointed in what we learned from our international colleagues, and we hope readers agree. It cannot be said, however, that their response to our mandate was in any respect ""simple"": the long experience of other nations with publicly financed school choice does not yield simple or unambiguous lessons for makers of American education policy. Every nation surveyed in this volume permits or encourages the public funding of nonpublic educational options, though the degree and kind of educational pluralism vary a great deal. The Dutch and Belgians go so far as to regard public funding of choice in education as a fundamental constitutional right. The Dutch educational system is founded on the principal of educational pluralism and, as a few American scholars (such as Charles L. Glenn) have for years pointed out, in the Netherlands at least, this principle seems to promote peace and satisfaction. Nowhere among the countries we surveyed did we find dire consequences of publicly funding choice. That is not to say that all is well. All nations struggle with educational problems, and some of them are quite familiar to Americans. Everywhere, it seems, segregation by class and race in schools, because it is a consequence of residential segregation, is difficult to overcome. And nearly everywhere there is, to one degree or another, a growing concern with schools that are, or might be, run by illiberal religious minorities. All of the nations whose educational policies we discuss take a wide range of civic concerns seriously when they decide how to fund and regulate nonpublic schools. Indeed, these countries have decided to fund nonpublic schools partly because of civic concerns. As several of our authors note, nonstate schools are generally viewed in these countries as proxies for the state in performing many important civic functions. Such a vision of broadly shared responsibility for civic education is not entirely alien to the United States. For example, Abraham Lincoln, in one of his earliest published speeches, said of respect for the laws: ""[L]et it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice."" It is one thing to argue, as Lincoln did, that nongovernmental institutions should assist the state in promoting civic values, but quite another to assert that the government should pay for such assistance. In the countries that we review here, it is seen to a great extent not only as defensible but also as obligatory for the government to provide resources to private schools to help them produce educated and responsible citizens. With public dollars come a wide variety of government regulations. These include the outcome-focused accountability mechanisms of Alberta, Canada (and to a lesser extent Flemish Belgium), which, because they rely on tests, are relatively unobtrusive with respect to the operation of schools. Then there are the more intrusive inspection systems of Britain, Germany, and France, which focus to a much greater degree on teaching and the educational process itself. In one important respect the accounts presented here are largely consistent with the claims of scholars such as Charles L. Glenn and Terry M. Moe, who have long asserted that the principal lesson for Americans to take from the international experience with publicly funding school choice is that parental choice is not nearly as frightening a policy as many critics suggest. Glenn in particular has long argued that the fears of school choice opponents in the United States-fears of balkanization or social disintegration and conflictare exaggerated and at odds with the experience of virtually the entire civilized world. From the essays that follow, Glenn's claim would appear to be true enough-but we have not yet gotten to the whole story or even to the most interesting part. The fact that other advanced democracies embrace publicly funded parental choice without falling prey to civic disintegration is but one side of the coin. More striking still, we believe, are the astonishing systems of regulation, accountability, and control that accompany public funding in other nations. They do not provide public funds to nonpublic schools with just a few strings attached; rather, they include a host of requirements regarding curriculum, testing, teacher qualifications, and admissions. Indeed, from an American point of view, these publicly funded schools of choice hardly seem ""private"": government-funded schools abroad are regulated and controlled to an extent that makes them quasi-public, essentially part of one public educational system. In most of the countries we survey here, the distinction between public and private schools is not nearly as important as it is in the United States. One major difference between attitudes toward the issue of choice overseas and those in the United States is that we did not hear much in our conversations, nor do we read much in the chapters below, of the benefits of educational markets and competition among schools. Perhaps other societies simply take the fact of competition among schools for granted. As Charles L. Glenn argues in his commentary, claims about the relative effectiveness of private and public schools-so important in U.S. policy debates-are likely to be less salient where educational choice is a fundamental right. But it is important to understand the nature of the ""right"" to educational pluralism as it exists in the Netherlands and elsewhere. That right does not bring with it strong exemptions from generally applicable rules and conditions. In many European countries, the constitutional right to establish a private school coexists side by side with state authority to inspect and close down such schools. Moreover, in some societies the right to school choice is the result of historical struggles between the state and an established church, which gave rise not to a system of competing schools, with frequent entry and exit of providers, but rather to a stable division of educational responsibilities among public and religious corporate entities and pervasive public regulation of all schools. France is most striking in this regard: the only major nonpublic educational option is Catholic schooling, and the proportions of public and Catholic school pupils are kept stable by mutual agreement. The Catholic option thus serves not as an active competitor to the public sector but as a ""safety valve,"" as Denis Meuret puts it. In the pluralist Netherlands, groups of parents who want their children to attend a school that has a distinctive educational philosophy have a constitutional right to have the government establish and fund such a school if one does not exist nearby or if the ones that do exist are full. This commitment to educational pluralism is qualified by an extensive system of public regulation and curricular mandates, as Charles Venegoni and David Ferrero emphasize in their commentary. Even the bold Dutch experience with school choice does not represent a strong commitment to private competition and market values as such, since parents have no right to form a school simply because it would be ""better"" or more efficient than available schools. In the Netherlands, when it comes to starting a new school with public funds, the question is not whether you can do it better but whether you want to do it differently. And educational differences are conditioned by common requirements that include uniform teacher training and student testing. The story that follows is in the main about a certain sort of publicly funded pluralism in education: pluralism justified by value differences but contained by significant regulation and tamed by systems that ensure accountability. This is not a story about wide-open market competition among minimally regulated schools. Copyright © 2004 THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION. All rights reserved.",,

Despite apparent consistent improvements in expressed racial attitudes over time, aversive racism continues to exert a subtle but pervasive influence on the lives of black Americans. This bias is expressed in indirect and rationalizable ways that restrict opportunities for blacks while insulating aversive racists from ever having to confront their prejudices. Most of the work reviewed in this chapter has focused on the influence of contemporary racial biases of whites toward blacks because of the central role that racial politics has played in the history of the United States. Within the United States, this dynamic also relates to varying degrees to orientations toward women (Dovidio & Gaertner, 1983b; Rudman & Kilianski, 2000) and more recently to homosexuals (Hebl, Foster, Mannix, & Dovidio, 2002). Moreover, we propose that many of the principles of aversive racism also apply more generally to the responses of the majority group to minority groups in contexts in which egalitarian ideals are valued and discrimination is censured (Dovidio, Gaertner, Anastasio, & Sanitioso, 1992). For instance, Pettigrew and Meertens (1995) have found that whereas blatant prejudice in Europe is related to the unconditional exclusion or severe limitation of immigrants, subtle prejudice is associated with constraints in immigration, such as prerequisite educational levels, that can be justified on the basis of factors ostensibly unrelated to race or ethnicity. However, paralleling the scenario that we described for race relations, when conditions change and people feel threatened-such as after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in the United States-subtle biases may become more open and result not only in incidents of overt violence but also directly in attitudes and political actions against immigrants and immigration (Esses, Dovidio, & Hodson, 2002). Bias associated with aversive racism is an elusive phenomenon, and the situation plays a critical moderating role. When an interracial situation is one in which an action could be readily attributed to racial bias, aversive racists carefully monitor their interracial behaviors and do not discriminate. In fact, they may respond even more favorably to blacks than to whites as a way of affirming their nonprejudiced self-images. But when the situation is ambiguous, norms for appropriate behavior are not clear, the circumstances permit a justification for negative behavior on the basis of some factor other than race, or aversive racists are not conscious of their actions, their bias is expressed. The challenge for addressing aversive racism thus resides in its elusiveness. Because aversive racists are unaware of their unconscious negative attitudes and their effects, and truly embrace their egalitarian self-image, they are motivated to deny the existence of these feelings and not to recognize or take responsibility for the adverse impact of their behavior on blacks. The subtle processes underlying discrimination motivated by aversive racism can be identified and isolated under the controlled conditions of the laboratory; however, at the societal and organizational levels, at which the controlled conditions of an experiment are rarely possible and multiple factors may shape decision making simultaneously, this process presents a substantial challenge to the equitable treatment of members of disadvantaged groups. Krieger (1995), in the Stanford Law Review, observed: ""Herein lies the practical problem. ... Validating subjective decisionmaking systems is neither empirically nor economically feasible, especially for jobs where intangible qualities, such as interpersonal skills, creativity, and ability to make sound judgments under conditions of uncertainty are critical"" (p. 1232). Thus the operation of aversive racism may go largely unnoticed and unaddressed in naturalistic settings. In addition, to the extent that discrimination reflects in-group favoritism (see also Gaertner et al., 1997), it is particularly difficult to address legally. Krieger (1998) adds, ""Title VII is poorly equipped to control prejudice resulting from in-group favoritism. ... In-group favoritism manifests itself gradually in subtle ways. It is unlikely to trigger mobilization of civil rights remedies because instances of this form of discrimination tend to go unnoticed. If they are noticed, they will frequently seem genuinely trivial or be economically unfeasible to pursue. ... For this reason as for others, we cannot expect existing equal opportunity tools adequately to prevent, identify, or redress this more modern form of discrimination"" (pp. 1325-1326). It is apparent that new techniques are needed to address this and other contemporary forms of racism. Developing individual, intergroup, and societal-level interventions that not only control the expressions of aversive racism but also address the negative components of aversive racism has critical social implications. Aversive racism represents a latent form of bias whose expression is strongly moderated by social circumstances and norms. A change in conditions or norms can allow this bias to operate more directly and openly (see Rogers & Prentice-Dunn, 1981). For instance, research on interracial aggression has demonstrated that under normal circumstances whites are not more aggressive and harmful toward blacks than toward whites. Overt and unprovoked aggression toward blacks would readily be perceived as racist. However, when whites are first antagonized by another person's aggressiveness, when they feel freed from prevailing norms through conditions that make them feel anonymous and deindividuated, or when norms change from censuring to supporting aggression, whites exhibit more aggressiveness toward blacks than toward whites (Donnerstein & Donnerstein, 1973; Donnerstein, Donnerstein, Simon, & Ditrichs, 1972; Kawakami, Spears, & Dovidio, 2002; Rogers & Prentice-Dunn, 1981). Latent racism also has important organizational implications. In corporate settings, racial discrimination in personnel selection decisions emerges when norms, which typically sanction discrimination, change and an organizational authority condones discrimination (Brief, Buttram, Elliott, Reizenstein, & McCline, 1995). Thus, besides its subtle contemporary influence, if left unaddressed, aversive racism provides the seed for bias to emerge when conditions allow or encourage a more open expression of discrimination. Future research on aversive racism has several productive avenues to pursue. One direction involves further exploration of ways to identify aversive racists. Although there is debate about the meaning and validity of implicit associations, we believe that these techniques can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of aversive racism. Karpinski and Hilton (2000) have argued that the types of responses measured by implicit techniques, such as the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., 1998), reflect environmental associations rather than personal endorsement of evaluations and stereotypes. In our earlier formulation of the aversive racism framework (Gaertner & Dovidio, 1986), we hypothesized that a broad range of cognitive, affective, and motivational influences contributed to the unconscious forces involved in aversive racism. One of these was that exposure to sociocultural influences relating to institutional and cultural racism (Jones, 1997), the cultural transmission of stereotypes (Schaller, Conway, & Tanchuk, 2002), and the portrayal of blacks in the mass media (Devine, 1989) would create and support unconscious negative associations with blacks and influence behavior toward blacks in consequential ways. The facts that (1) these associations come to mind often automatically and without intentional control for many whites, as implicit techniques have demonstrated, and (2) that these associations predict subtle behavioral manifestations of bias (Dovidio et al., 2002; Son Hing et al., 2002), particularly in the absence of conscious personal endorsement, are consistent with our aversive racism framework. In addition, although many of the techniques used to measure implicit evaluation and stereotypes focus on processes reflective of ""cold"" cognition, with little involvement of affective process, implicit racial evaluations are also related to fundamental affective and motivational reactions. Phelps et al. (2000) demonstrated that responses on the Implicit Association Test, but not responses on a self-report measure of prejudice, predicted activation of the amygdala, a subcortical structure of the brain that plays a role in emotional learning and evaluation and is responsive to threats. Thus, although we still contend that unconscious affective and cognitive processes contribute to aversive racism in ways beyond the effects of implicit negative associations (Nail et al., 2003), we acknowledge that implicit associations are a key component and that the techniques developed to measure implicit evaluations and stereotypes are important tools for studying aversive racism and for distinguishing aversive racists from truly nonprejudiced people. Before the development of such measures, we generally assumed that, given the pervasive psychological and social forces promoting bias, most white Americans who said they were not prejudiced were actually aversive racists. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The increased attention to corporate social responsibility has paralleled growing concern about sustainable development and the intensifying activities of pressure groups (consumers, customers, investors, NGOs, labour unions, the media, among others) that have been increasing since the 1990s as natural resources are progressively becoming exhausted, social tensions rising and environmental conditions deteriorating worldwide.

Based on a case study of platinum and chrome mining in South Africa, this article argues that the business case is circumscribed by companies' institutional context. In the past, mining companies' dominant interpretation of CSR has been in terms of charitable donations and support to good causes. These efforts have not alleviated the contribution of mining companies to growing social problems around the mines, primarily because they have not impacted on core business practices and have not contributed to necessary cross-sectoral collaboration. Recently, however, there has been an important transition involving the broadening of the interpretation of CSR and increasing commitment to these issues amongst corporate leadership. Though market-based incentives have contributed to this, the key driver has been the State's legislated transformation programme premised on State sovereignty over mineral resources. Hence, while the interrelationship between companies and their institutional context has, in the past, brought about a vicious cycle of irresponsibility and minimal collaboration, this cycle may be reversed into a virtuous one, driven in particular by the State. The broader implication is that references to a business case for CSR and partnerships cannot be relied upon independently of continued efforts at shaping the public sector context of companies. © 2004 United Nations.","Business case; Corporate social responsibility; Cross-sectoral collaboration; Institutional context; Mining companies; South Africa","Industrial management; Laws and legislation; Marketing; Mineral resources; Mining; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Collaborations; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Partnerships; Stakeholders; Economic and social effects; business; corporate strategy; institutional reform; mining industry; social policy; Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; World"

This article examines the chemical industry's approach to CSR from the perspective of two emerging economies: Mexico and South Africa. The global chemical industry was one of the first to respond to public concerns about environmental pollution, toxic waste and human health by adopting an industry-wide code of practice, known as Responsible Care. This article examines the extent to which the chemical industry has responded to the broader debate on CSR. On the basis of a comparative case study, this article argues that the response to social issues by Mexican and South African chemical companies has tended to be limited to the 'community awareness and emergency response' (CAER) or community dialogue component of the international voluntary management framework, Responsible Care. Similarities and differences in regulatory and institutional conditions, as well as different levels of civil society engagement, reveal additional limitations for CSR, beyond that of the Responsible Care framework. This article argues that the socio-political context influences the extent to which companies embrace CSR, especially in emerging economies, and highlights several challenges for the chemical industry in moving forward on CSR: credibility, stakeholder engagement, value-chain accountability, disclosure and transparency. Reflecting on these challenges, the authors conclude by recommending a renewed focus on: (1) developing a broader set of CSR management practices beyond Responsible Care; (2) institutionalizing stronger accountability measures, such as reporting and verification; and (3) developing multi-stakeholder partnerships that complement regulation and build public sector regulatory and guidance capacity. © 2004 United Nations.","Chemical industry; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management systems; Mexico; Responsible care; South Africa","Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Industrial economics; Public policy; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Community awareness and emergency response (CAER); Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Emerging economy; Multi-stakeholder partnerships; Chemical industry; chemical industry; corporate strategy; environmental economics; environmental management; international comparison; Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; Mexico [North America]; North America; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Western Hemisphere; World"

The spaces of engagement between anticorporate activism and corporate social responsibility are constructed through a variety of means, including ethical trading initiatives and corporate codes of conduct.

While the primary interests of CSR activists remain distinct from those of traditional corporate governance (CG) activists, the two groups do share an interest in minimizing the risk of negative environmental or social impacts from the operations of the corporation. They also share the objective of achieving transparency and accountability in corporate decision-making. In relation to this latter objective, they both face similar challenges concerning conflicts of interest among key institutional shareholders. This article examines the record of shareholder proposal filing and voting from 2000-2003 for 81 large US public corporations to determine the relative prominence of CSR shareholder activism and the prospects for effective CSR shareholder activism on key environmental issues. The analysis of these data finds that nearly half (45%) of all shareholder resolutions are related to CSR, and that those resolutions which combine issues of CSR with traditional CG activism appeal to slightly more shareholders than issues of CSR alone. The article also examines shareholder activism at the micro level with a case study of the voting record at ExxonMobil. The article finds that CSR-related shareholder activism represents the majority of shareholder activism within that firm and that resolutions targeted at climate change are particularly well supported. These resolutions draw a connection between environmental risk and risk to shareholder value. While numerous challenges remain for both CG and CSR activists, the article concludes that reforms that strengthen shareholder rights and corporate governance more generally will also benefit CSR activists and the environmental policies they promote in particular.

The effect occurs both directly and indirectly through the behavior's effect on customer-corporation identification. The authors report the results of four studies designed to replicate and extend these findings. Using a field survey design, Study 1 provides evidence that perceived corporate social responsibility affects not only customer purchase behavior through customer-corporate identification but also customer donations to corporate-supported nonprofit organizations. Using experimental designs, Studies 2 and 3 replicate and extend the Study 1 findings by providing additional evidence for the mediating role of customer-corporate identification on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and customer donations. However, the combined results of Studies 2 and 3 also show that because of a ""perceived opportunity to do good"" by supporting a company that is changing its ways, consumers are more likely to donate to a corporate-supported nonprofit when the corporation has a weaker historical record of socially responsible behavior. Finally, Study 4 tests the relationship between the nonprofit domain and the domain of the corporation's socially responsible behavior as a boundary condition for this effect.",,

This article comments various areas of study that are related to this upsurge in RSE. It is argued that in order to advance in the study of RSE as a development tool, it is necessary to include a third perspective: that of political economy. The hypothesis on which this is based is that RSE conduct depends on two relationships: a) the relationship of the economic sector and the productive sector to which a business pertains, and b) the relationship between the state and the business sector. The conclusion is that in spite of the exaggerated emphasis on RSE, it is necessary to study more profoundly the relationship government-business. In this paper we have focused on the proposal to include business in the political economy. It is still necessary to analytically study why certain businesses are more socially responsible than others.","Ethics; Political economy; Social responsibility of businesses; State","business; corporate strategy; ethics; political economy; Latin America; Western Hemisphere; World"

Two key problems associated with these stakeholder engagement initiatives are: identifying and reaching a wide range of stakeholders; and determining a consensus set of stakeholder expectations from a range of potentially mutually exclusive views held by different stakeholders. This paper addresses both of these issues. It firstly examines the moral consensus building discourse criteria of an ideal speech situation advocated by Jürgen Habermas, and proposes these criteria as a suitable theoretical model for determining a consensus set of social, environmental, economic and ethical responsibilities to be addressed by an organisation. Secondly, it investigates the extent to which the interactivity and wide reach offered by the internet could assist in realising the theoretical potential of an ideal speech situation debate in practice, and thus facilitate democratic debates leading to a greater degree of equity in the determination of corporate social, environmental, economic and ethical responsibilities. This exploration is informed by analysis of Shell's internet based stakeholder dialogue 'web forum' against the theoretical consensus building discourse ethics criteria of an ideal speech situation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It does so by locating corporate governance in present day capitalism. Politically, the rise of governance since the early 1990s is part of a more general discursive attempt to combine neoliberalism with social responsibility, which works in the specific case of corporate governance by constructing a plausible but intellectually fragile narrative about agency problems and solutions which would align shareholder and management interests. Economically, the initial promise of corporate governance in the 1990s and the growing disappointment with governance in the early 2000s are then related to successive phases of financialisation: governance promised much in the 1990s as long as the bull market delivered equity value for shareholders; while the limits of corporate governance were demonstrated after the tipping point in the different circumstances of the early 2000s. It is then argued that disappointment is inevitable because procedural rules cannot control the self-serving behaviour of social and political elites in the UK and US. If corporate governance was ostensibly about safeguarding shareholder interests, effectively corporate governance sanctioned a huge increase in absolute and relative pay for US and UK top managers who remain the major beneficiaries of governance in a world where the giant corporation has become an important accelerator of inequality.","Corporate governance; Elites; Financialisation; Neoliberalism; Present day capitalism",

My analysis finds that substantive discussions of ethics are conspicuous by their absence.

In 1993 the state government set out parameters for reform to change the size, structure, performance, and culture of the water industry. The path taken was not privatization, but corporatization. Tools used included amalgamation of organizations; separating water provisions from local government; changing the composition and reporting mechanisms of the boards; establishing clear benchmarks and performance criteria; making information publicly available; and providing a commercial orientation. The outcomes of the reforms were to be a focus on water quality and effluent management. In 2001, 15 water authorities were in place. There were significant improvements in accountability, finances, and performance. The authorities provided information on performance to both the state and the public. Reductions of operating costs have been in the range of 20-35%, with savings put back into new infrastructure. Water quality has significantly improved in a number of parameters and effluent management has also improved.

We consider the various factors which have given rise to the growth of SRI in both countries. As SRI is currently more mature in the UK than in Japan, we consider ways in which the UK experience may provide some lessons for the growth of SRI in Japan. Significantly, we consider that the use of corporate governance mechanisms such as engagement and dialogue by large shareholders, to solve social, ethical and environmental (SEE) problems in companies, is a realistic route for the development of SRI in Japan. However, these mechanisms need to be designed so that they may operate more efficiently. Pension funds and other investment institutions need to appreciate the value of engagement over screening as an SRI strategy. Further, the disclosure of SRI strategies by pension funds in Japan may contribute to enhancing consciousness about the responsibility of shareholders for the SEE outcomes of corporate activities that they invest in indirectly. We acknowledge, however, that this suggestion may be difficult to implement in the near future.","Institutional investors; Japan; Socially responsible investment",

Yet CSR's halo on consumer behavior may extend beyond product evaluations, into nonroutine types of judgments such as attributions. We examine the possibility that the CSR halo affects consumers' attributions in a product-harm crisis situation. In two studies that employ experimental manipulations of prior CSR on a sample of consumers, we examine whether attributions that are influenced by CSR mediate the impact of product-harm crises on consumers' brand evaluations. The results of Study 1 support the hypothesis. Study 2 introduces a boundary condition on the results of Study 1, showing that mediation effects are only found for consumers that are CSR-sensitive.

The recent spate of corporate scandals in the United States and elsewhere has dramatized, once again, the severity of the agency problems that may arise between managers and shareholders. These scandals remind us that even if we adopt an extremely narrow concept of managerial responsibility - such that we recognize no social responsibility beyond the obligation to maximize shareholder value - there may still be very serious difficulties associated with the effective institutionalization of this obligation. It also suggests that if we broaden managerial responsibility, in order to include extensive responsibilities to various other stakeholder groups, we may seriously exacerbate these agency problems, making it even more difficult to impose effective discipline upon managers. Hence, our central question: is a strong commitment to corporate social responsibility institutionally feasible In searching for an answer, we revisit the history of public management, and in particular, the experience of social-democratic governments during the 1960s and 1970s, and their attempts to impose social responsibility upon the managers of nationalized industries. The results of this inquiry are less than encouraging for proponents of corporate social responsibility. In fact, the history of public-sector management presents a number of stark warnings, which we would do well to heed if we wish to reconcile robust social responsibility with effective corporate governance.","agency problems; corporate governance; corporate social responsibility; multiprincipal agency problems; multitask agency problems; public management; stake-holder theory",

The UN Global Compact, the more famous of these initiatives, counts today more than 1,000 corporate members. The common point of all these efforts is their intent to alter the way a company carries out its operations in relation to how it treats immediate stakeholders (clients, employees, investors, and the local communities where it operates) and/or the impact of its activities on society at large, without having recourse to direct regulation, and with the objective of promoting social justice and sustainability. © 2004 Society for International Development 1011-6370/04.",,"corporate strategy; developing world; industrial practice; social justice"

Many of these companies have produced formal reports covering their performance on environmental and social issues. Continued improvement and delivery of commitments depends on buy-in not just from senior management (and the CR manager), but from managers and staff across the organization. This is only possible if there is a culture that is supportive of corporate responsibility. One key aspect of making this change is understanding how the company's culture affects corporate responsibility performance. This paper discusses some areas of organizational culture that affect CR performance including rewards and recognition, learning and managing change, awareness and involvement, questioning culture and flexibility underpinned by mutual respect. It also provides an overview of our approach for assessing and fostering a supportive culture.

An extreme case is the pricing of life-saving drugs in developing countries; industry critics have pointed to price as an obstacle to treatment and a factor in the deaths of millions of AIDS victims. This article examines socially responsible pricing in the form of differential pricing across markets, taking into account ability to pay and social welfare. An analysis of AIDS drug pricing between 1999 and 2003 suggests that, in fact, the high prices of AIDS drugs in developing countries sub-optimized contribution earnings in those markets. In the 1990s, multinationals could have earned greater contribution in developing countries by reducing prices, while also saving thousands of lives. However, that could have jeopardized earnings in developed countries, and this, together with other factors, created barriers to socially responsible pricing. Neither multinationals nor developing-country governments can alone create conditions for socially responsible pricing to prevail. This article identifies the role of different players in addressing barriers to socially responsible pricing, including multinationals, governments, non-governmental organizations, and multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization. This article also offers lessons for managers in industries with characteristics similar to the drug industry, where socially responsible pricing also may be needed, if not demanded.",,

It was written by Milton Friedman, distinguished professor of economics at the University of Chicago and regular columnist for Newsweek. Based on part of a chapter of Friedman's 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, the essay has been one of the most widely cited - and criticized - of all Friedman's popular writings. My goals for this article are to propose a free-market model of business ethics for firms of all sizes and types (by describing a past attempt to promote such a standard), to comment on the history of regulation and on the emergence and teachings of the discipline of ""business ethics,"" and to argue that Friedman's perspective on corporate responsibility as outlined in 1970 and his subsequent position on corporate lobbying are counterproductive to the furtherance of such a free-market model among leaders of the business community. © 2004.",,"business; ethics"

This article draws out important lessons from the United Nations Global Compact with corporations, showing how corporate power can be harnessed and restrained to render globalization more just and inclusive. Kuper shows that we should change our approach to development in two ways. First, we need to redistribute responsibilities: Instead of assuming that the state is necessarily the most capable agent for delivering justice and reducing poverty, we can recognize the distinctive competences and responsibilities of non-state actors in advancing human rights and human capabilities. Second, we need to reconfigure representation: Instead of relying on elections alone, we can recognize and empower non-state actors to check and balance elected representatives in a number of ways. In contexts where states and elections are ineffective, or less effective than non-state actors, these innovations make it possible to allocate obligations more successfully, so as to create a new balance of powers. Within this complex division of labour, corporations can become agents of development. © 2004 Society for International Development 1011-6370/04.","Democracy; Development theory; Global governance; Justice; Multinational corporations","corporate strategy; globalization; multinational enterprise; social justice"

This paper considers some of the areas in which the commercialisation of biotechnology research may affect public trust. The increasing involvement of the private sector in basic research and the need for the public sector to commercialise its research has resulted in a blurring of the divide between the two sectors. The expanding public and private partnerships are creating an elision between the two sectors. In biotechnology, knowledge itself has become commodified and subject to confidentiality agreements and patent protections. These trends are challenging the traditional science norms of universalism, collegiality, disinterestedness and organised scepticism. These trends may equally have a detrimental flow on effect in relation to public trust in science. This paper considers and emphasises the appropriate roles of regulation, public consultation and corporate social responsibility and benefit sharing in protecting and restoring the key factor of public trust.","Biotechnology law; Biotechnology research; Patents; Public trust","Contracts; Patents and inventions; Privatization; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Social aspects; Commercialization; Public trust; Biotechnology; biotechnology; commercialization; legislation; research and development; biotechnology; commercial phenomena; commercialization; law; organization; patent; privacy; public opinion; research; review; science; social behavior; trust"

In practice, each CSR theory presents four dimensions related to profits, political performance, social demands and ethical values. The findings suggest the necessity to develop a new theory on the business and society relationship, which should integrate these four dimensions.","corporate citizenship; corporate responsiveness; corporate social performance; corporate social responsibility; issues management; stakeholder manage ment; sustainable development; the common good",

The metaphor of corporate citizenship suggests an institutional approach to corporate social responsibility. Citizenship is a social role, characterized by an orientation towards the social contract, collective and active responsibility, as well as a positive attitude towards the juridical state. By analogy, corporate citizenship is a social role, characterized by the social contract of business, a participatory ethics of business, the precautionary principle and the promotion of just international institutions. It is considered that corporate citizenship depends on a number of interacting institutional conditions that hold society partly responsible for the social performance of their companies. Finally, the problem of the dissolution of corporate social responsibility is reviewed in an institutional environment where everyone is considered responsible.","business ethics; corporate citizenship; corporate social responsibility; institutions; metaphor",

Two strategies have been proposed for the issue of CSR: a compliance strategy and a cultural change strategy (Karssing, 2001). This article focuses on the ethical and philosophical presuppositions of these different approaches. The incorporation of CSR in organizations cannot be accomplished by means of a compliance strategy only. Rather, it needs to be supplemented by a strategy aimed at stimulating a transformation process on the corporate culture level. The perspective of change through dialogue is proposed as a means of innovating the curriculum and the primary processes of student education. This organizational change perspective is demonstrated by describing how (ethical) reflective aspects are integrated in the curriculum of the Free University of Amsterdam. An additional case study on organizational value learning is presented to illustrate the thesis that CSR presupposes that university is an adequate context where life-long learning begins.","dialogue; ethical presuppositions; organizational change; reflective approach; value learning",

Which wishes of which stakeholders should be honored? How can we legitimize the new societal and public role of business firms? The outcome of this analysis will be translated to the practice of management; how can we strengthen the social responsibility of managers? Four options will be discussed. (1) Market regulation, which binds the actions of managers. (2) Professionalization of management, which seeks for better information. (3) Moral management, which incorporates norms and values from outside the market. (4) Stakeholder management, which leaves room for the participation of stakeholders. These options can be schematized according to an internal-external axis and an objective-subjective axis.

All those in a pharmaceutical company who currently work within pharmacovigilance should be encouraged to lead from the front to examine ongoing marketing activities to see how they can be adapted more towards pharmacovigilance and risk management. The current irony is that the personnel who have the greatest influence on benefit-risk decisions of a product are not necessarily those who acknowledge that they are performing pharmacovigilance. Indeed, for all concerned, whether their orientation is scientific and commercial, effective communication with prescribers and consumers usually underpins product success. Also, a substantial 'marketing' budget is culturally acceptable for the pharmaceutical industry so it is logical to assume that resource for postmarketing activity is often made available. Given these realities, I suggest we should strive for an integrated marketing and risk-management plan based on the best available evidence and that being fully aware and in control of the safety issues for your products is the best way to commercialise them successfully.

This article discusses quantitative and qualitative aspects of power possessed by companies and by states. A more adequate comparison than that between company sales and gross national product is the one between company value added and GNP. Also more adequate is the comparison between the public sector and company net profit. These rival measures take down company power to about a tenth of the sales measure. Also in qualitative terms the ""exit power"" of the company gives a low impact compared to governmental action and the article concludes that company power by common measures is overestimated. However, the aggregated long-term effect of the market economy on the development of society is most significant. But it is a mistake to use that judgment as an argument for the opinion that business executives are the major power holders in modern societies. Perceptions of power also have an impact on which expectations and commitments that can be judged as realistic and therefore the issue of power is central for the normative discussion about corporate social responsibility.","Corporatism; Economic influence; Executive power; Power holders; Responsibility",

While the movement toward ""right-sizing"" has been applied to all staff functions, not just EHS, it comes at a time when corporate social responsibility, sustainable development and global EHS impacts are emerging as looming concerns for many companies. EHS professionals, particularly at the site level, are taking on much broader assignments with fewer resources at their disposal. Corporate EHS organizations have moved toward centralized, shared service-type structures with outsourcing a dominate factor at all levels.

It is argued that shareholder value cannot be justified simply by referring to any prerogative property rights of the shareholders. Instead, shareholder value coincides with the efficient hypothetical perfect contract. However, due to contractual failures in certain bargaining situations, management may be unable to ""internalize the firms externalities"". This means that in these situations there is a tradeoff between a broad duty of loyalty for management in listed firms and other traditional remedies. The theoretical insights are applied on a case from the Danish Supreme Court (Louis Poulsen A/S) where the interests of the stakeholders were decisive. It is shown that the verdict may instead harm the relevant stakeholders illustrating how cautious the legal system should use a doctrine based on the ""company's interests"". In addition, the notion of a firm's social responsibility is critically evaluated together with the associated pitfalls of accepting this concept.","Company law; Corporate governance; Duty of loyalty; Shareholder value; Stakeholder theory",

We argue that the metaphor is beneficial for considering the physical flows of matter and energy in economic systems as it can yield models with which a vision of a more sustainable material and energy flow system can be constructed. But the difference of ecosystems and economic systems is so radical, that the metaphor can only be used as a source of inspiration for simulations and future scenarios, not for giving practical and concrete design, management or policy objectives and action-proposals. Our analysis reveals that the metaphor cannot be used to study the human dimension or the societal context of the material and energy flows. The human dimension is critically important to achieve a real change toward sustainability in environmental policy, corporate environmental management and corporate social responsibility.","Agriculture and food industry; Economic system; Ecosystem; Material and energy flows","agricultural management; farming system; food industry; sustainability; Lethrinidae"

The paper argues that not only has SRI grown significantly, it has also matured. In particular, it has become an investment philosophy adopted by a growing proportion of large investment institutions. This shift in SRI from margin to mainstream and the position in which institutional investors find themselves is leading to a new form of SRI shareholder pressure. Although this bears some resemblance to lobbying campaigns which might take advantage of shareholder rights, we seek to distinguish it as an important phenomenon in its own right - one to which corporate executives are likely to be paying increasing attention in the years to come. We further argue that this approach potentially meets some of the earlier ethical criticisms of certain forms of SRI but, ironically, probably owes its existence to those pioneering approaches.

This paper looks at the fundamental theories of ethics and morality, and shows how these and a fuller consideration of these can lead to better practice of social responsibility through a higher platform of quality, which we call quality consciousness. The paper shows that business actions, and indeed the pedagogy of management theory, are not in themselves amoral. Rather, they are driven by a systematic reflection of the context. The paper develops the implication of this for the extension and strengthening of the concept of quality by delineating the definitional boundary of quality, and then scrutinizing the philosophy of quality and the philosophy of virtue and morality to examine conceptual inter-linkage and symbiosis. The paper promulgates a view of quality that explicitly incorporates virtue as part of the quality paradigm. The paper then charts how the rigorous incorporation of ethics and organizational morality can be made in quality management, and how this will lead to the next stage of evolution in quality theory and the role this new heightened sense will play in better managerial practice of corporate social responsibility. By critique, the paper develops a tentative framework to move toward the virtuous organization. This, the paper suggests, is the next stage of quality evolution.","Corporate accountability and responsibility; Ethics; Quality",

Design: Analysis of documents held at the BAT archive in Guildford, UK. Results: Considerable priority was attached to investing in the FSU. This led BAT to undertake a major organisational change and to intense competition to acquire assets. BAT used flawed economic arguments to persuade cash starved governments that its investment would reap economic rewards. It offered excise advice that disadvantaged governments while benefiting BAT, confused issues over pricing, and avoided competitive tendering. BAT targeted agriculture ministries, using its expertise in leaf production to differentiate itself from other potential investors. It subverted the principles of corporate social responsibility to promote itself as a business partner. BAT's task was made easier by the naivety of post-Soviet governments and by the international financial organisations' support for rapid economic reform. The latter permitted tobacco transnationals to penetrate markets before effective competitive tendering processes had been established, giving them the opportunity to minimise prices and establish monopolies. Conclusions: Many of the arguments employed when penetrating post-Soviet markets were highly misleading but governments lacked expertise to realise this. There is a need to build tobacco control capacity in transition economies, within and outside government, to ensure that governments are better informed of the true economic and health impacts of tobacco. Rapid transition from socialist to market economies without establishing regulatory institutional structures may be dangerous when investing companies use business practices that fall short of international standards.",,"economic aspect; human; marketing; organization; review; social aspect; tobacco industry; United Kingdom; USSR; Advertising; Commerce; Commonwealth of Independent States; Economic Competition; Humans; Marketing; Private Sector; Smoking; Tobacco Industry"

The MSC is the only international fisheries organization working to provide a market-based incentive, encouraging consumers to make the best environmental choice in seafood, by setting a standard against which independent accredited certification bodies assess fisheries. It devotes time and attention to bringing a broad spectrum of stakeholders to the table, maintaining dialogue with all sectors. As more fisheries engage in the certification process, valuable lessons have been learnt on the importance of stakeholder input. Market leading supermarkets recognize that consumers expect retailers to make responsible purchasing decisions as part of their corporate social responsibility.

Marketing material and investment prospectuses issued by socially responsible mutual funds (SRI funds) commonly contain the claim that, by affecting corporations' access to capital funding, SRI funds can change corporate practices. This paper makes a contribution by presenting the market share of SRI funds in the regions where they are most developed, being Europe, the U.S. and Australia, to show that this claim is unlikely to eventuate. SRI funds also commonly claim that they will outperform conventional active mutual funds. That the economic performances of both are similar might be explained by their similar portfolio compositions. The paper makes an innovation in the SRI literature by adopting a legitimacy framework to explain the continued presence of SRI funds. To achieve desired social and environmental outcomes, SRI funds are urged to address issues at a more systemic level.

This article assesses the framing of obesity in news coverage since 1985 to determine whether obesity is being reframed in these terms. The data suggest that a vigorous frame contest is currently under way between arguments emphasizing personal responsibility for health and arguments emphasizing the social environment, including corporate and public policy.

The corporate social responsiveness orientation of business executives plays an important role in corporate decision making since managers make important decisions on behalf of their corporations. This paper explores whether there is a relationship between an individual's degree of religiousness and his or her corporate social responsiveness (CSR) orientation. The results of a survey of 473 business students found a significant relationship between degree of religiousness and attitudes toward the economic and ethical components of CSR. Some explanations as well as limited generalizations and implications are developed.","Business education; Ethics; Religiousness; Social responsibility; Students",

We conclude that the area of investor responsibility is relatively undeveloped. The next section of the article describes and analyses forces and factors relevant to operations involving hazardous activities that present particular risks to human health and the environment, and places these within the context of investment decision-making.

Rather than being left to chance, this power to serve as ethics leaders must be used to establish a social context within which positive self-regulation of ethical behavior becomes a clear and compelling organizational norm and in which people act ethically as a matter of routine. This article frames the responsibility for strategic leadership of ethical behavior on three premises: (1) It must be done - a stakeholder analysis of the total costs of ethical failures confirms the urgency for ethics change; (2) It can be done - exemplars show that a compelling majority of an organization's membership can be influenced to make ethical choices; (3) It is sustainable-integrity programs help build and confirm corporate cultures in which principled actions and ethics norms predominate.",,

The latter set of challenges has received almost no attention at all in the academic literature or media. This paper begins to remedy that lacuna, examining ethical issues that arise specifically on account of the status of biotech companies as commercial entities. The focus here is on three representative issues: product safety, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance. It is argued that each of these issues poses particular ethical challenges for companies in the biotech sector. In the area of product safety, it is noted that biotech companies face particular challenges in determining what counts as a 'safe' product, given the contentious nature of what might count as a 'harm' in the biotech field. In the area of corporate social responsibility, the adoption of a 'stakeholder approach' and an attempt to manage the social consequences of products pose special challenges for biotech companies. This is due to the enormous range of groups and individuals claiming to have a stake in the doings of such companies, and the trenchant controversies over just what the social consequences of various biotechnologies might be. In the area of corporate governance, biotech companies need to seek out and follow best practices regarding the ways in which information, authority, and influence flow between a company's shareholders, managers, and Board of Directors, if they are to avoid duplicating the ethical and financial scandal that brought down ImClone. An important meta-issue, here - one that renders each of these corporate ethical challenges more vexing - is the difficulty of finding the appropriate benchmarks for ethical corporate behavior in a field as controversial, and as rapidly evolving, as biotechnology. Three programmatic suggestions can be made: Firstly, scholars and others interested in the ethical performance of the biotech sector must seek out and build opportunities for richer interdisciplinary collaboration. Secondly, companies within the biotech sector must seek out expertise and build capacity and competency in dealing with the corporate ethical issues that arise in their sector. Finally, companies in the biotech sector should explore the opportunities for collective problem solving afforded by the existence of local, national, and international industry associations such as the Biotechnology Industry Organization, BIOTECanada, and EuropaBio.",,"biomedicine; biosafety; biotechnology; commercial phenomena; competence; ethics; financial management; industry; manager; organization and management; postmarketing surveillance; priority journal; problem solving; responsibility; review; social behavior; Biomedical and Behavioral Research; Genetics and Reproduction; Benchmarking; Biotechnology; Canada; Ethics, Business; Humans; Industry"

The question arises whether and to what extent governance models that have been developed within the corporate world can be valuable for these reflections. Due to the unique societal position of hospitals - which involves a large diversity of stakeholders - the claim for autonomy of various highly professional groups and the lack of clear business objectives, principles of corporate governance cannot be translated into the hospital sector without specific adjustments. However, irrespective of these contextual differences, corporate governance can provide for a comprehensive 'frame of reference', to which the hospital sector will have to give its own interpretation. A multidisciplinary research unit of the university of Leuven has taken the initiative to develop a governance model for Belgian hospitals.

Corporate governance focuses on the internal and external mechanisms that help solve the agency problem that exists between owners and controllers of the firm. Here, it is argued that internal mechanisms for corporate governance are useful and important in the world of the media and have so far been relatively neglected by media regulators. Good governance is a much looser term. We propose to reserve this concept for the political side of media regulation (media as the fourth power in a democracy). The basic ideas about what good governance entails for the media can be found in the report written by the Hutchins Commission. Looking for the best possible governance structures that help us implement the basic principles laid out by the Hutchins Commission forms the bulk of media regulation in modern democracies. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an even looser and broader concept than good governance. This contribution goes beyond the political side of the media and focuses on the impact of the media on identity and group formation. I will argue that the impact of the media in a post-modern society is potentially very large and that this justifies a different type of media regulation in which content regulation has a much bigger part to play1. © Walter de Gruyter.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Good governance; Media regulation",

On the other hand, there are ways in which CSR could, whether by mistake or design, damage the same communities, politically, socially and economically This paper presents evidence that demonstrates that although there is a good business case for Shell to contribute to poverty alleviation in the Niger Delta, Nigeria, there is also a danger that in the long term Shell could effectively be leading the pace of, and directing the paths to, socio-economic development in the region with little or no contribution from the Nigerian government. The paper concludes that lack of national macro-economic planning and management, backed by equitable resource allocation, and an enabling environment, have significant implications for the overall performance of CSR initiatives by multinational corporations (MNCs) in developing countries. In other words, if the macroeconomy is under-performing due to government failure, there is a likelihood that the contributions of MNCs to poverty alleviation could fail to achieve the desired outcomes.

This has recently manifested itself in the formulation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies and strategies and a proliferation of CSR, environmental, sustainability and community reporting. Several brief case studies are used to illustrate the issues and conflicts that arise between mining company operations and the environment and community, and how these have led to the development of corporate strategies to deal with environment and community issues. The paper then examines mining company reports, revealing the language and constructs used by the mining industry to frame its responsibility to the environment and community and role in possible conflicts.

In 2002, a case study was conducted to determine the variance in perspective between corporate managers and stakeholders with regard to CSR. Specifically, both parties were asked about: 1) their definitions of CSR, 2) balancing profitability and social responsibility and 3) the role of the stakeholder.

Indian corporations, like their counterparts in developed countries, took hesitant steps towards environmental protection - most of them driven by legal compliance. A selected few companies, however, took to environmental protection, enhancement and reporting through overall business considerations. The study indicates that environmental reporting, barring a few cases, is unsystematic and noncomparable. Though good work is being done by some industrial sectors and some units in different sectors, the reports seem to be aimed more at publicity than providing environmental facts and figures.

The Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) is a major change management initiative across an entire industry to fundamentally examine - and change - the way it does business. The Initiative was established in 1999 by 10 of the world's leading cement companies under the auspices of World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). They wanted to understand sustainable development for their industry - to move beyond a philosophical discussion and understand what changes in business practice might be required. At individual level many companies have embraced the need for change in pursuit of these goals. RMC Group plc, one of the founding members of the CSIprogrammers, has already established an International Energy Efficiency programme. For any company, good energy management is essential - it can reduce operating costs, increase profitability, identify maintenance needs and improve environmental performance. RMC designed and built an intranet-based tool, the Energy Efficiency Information System, which provides individual plant managers with information on how to monitor and control energy use and identifies savings opportunities.

We divide our discussion into three major parts. First, we discuss the current understanding of large organizations manifested in the prevailing legal and cultural climate. We argue that organizations are often treated as a type of juristic person. As such, they have not only certain rights, but also certain responsibilities to the larger society. For this reason, accountability for corporate actions is of major importance. In the second section, we review the psychological processes by which individuals come to attribute responsibility. In accordance with Fairness Theory, we suggest that there are three central issues to consider when attributing responsibility to organizations for unjust acts. Organizations are held accountable when an alternative state would have been better than a current situation, when the firm could have feasibly avoided creating the negative conditions, and when the harm should never have taken place (i.e., it violated ethical and moral standards). Finally, in the third section of the paper, we elaborate and discuss several organizational tactics for addressing an accusation of accountability. These include both short-term, single-loop tactics, as well as long-term, double-loop tactics. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Accountability; Fairness Theory; Organizational Justice",

At each of the three pilot sites, ""focus groups"" were constituted, one or two groups with ""internal"" stakeholders as employees, other groups with ""external"" stakeholders. The work of the groups generated indicator proposals, which were then classified in two ways. First, stakeholders' suggestions were gathered under categories established at international level covering both 'social' and 'environmental' dimensions of company responsibility. Second, the indicator suggestions were organised into a matrix with reference to (1) the category of stakeholder making the suggestion; (2) the site at which the suggestion was made; (3) the generic character versus specificity of the indicator.

At the same time, these companies are facing new demands to address global issues such as environmental concerns and poverty. In this context, what does it mean to be a “corporate citizen”? The author examines the emergence of the concept of corporate responsibility and citizenship, including the long-standing debate about whether a company owes its allegiance primarily to shareholders or to a broad community of stakeholders. He then considers what these concepts mean in a global context. While citizenship in a single nation has typically been defined by geography or ethnicity, global citizenship is a much more uncertain concept. The author discusses some of the challenges that face business in meeting conflicting national demands for citizenship, such as the troubles faced by Yahoo! when US users of its online auctions offered Nazi memorabilia on its website, accessible in France. The sale was protected under US First Amendment rights but banned under French law. The author also discusses the emerging concept of “cosmopolitan” or “global” citizenship. It is clear that companies must address global concerns, but each individual company must determine how to define global citizenship for itself and how to balance this identity with responsibilities that it may have to various local, national, and regional communities.

We then use these claims as a basis upon which to argue (a) that what is sound about the idea of a Triple Bottom Line is not novel, and (b) that what is novel about the idea is not sound. We argue on both conceptual and practical grounds that the Triple Bottom Line is an unhelpful addition to current discussions of corporate social responsibility. Finally, we argue that the Triple Bottom Line paradigm cannot be rescued simply by attenuating its claims: the rhetoric is badly misleading, and may in fact provide a smokescreen behind which firms can avoid truly effective social and environmental reporting and performance.",,

Because these product dimensions do not fit easily into traditional decision theories, a new conceptual framework that incorporates and emphasizes the consumer's enduring principles and values is explored in this study.

It suggests that the advantages of flexibility and adaptability to specific circumstances offered by such codes are counterbalanced by their self-selected content and inadequate enforcement. Rejecting the assumption that there is a sharp distinction between voluntary standards and binding law, the essay analyzes various ways of grounding codes in legal obligations. It proposes that a safer and more dependable environment for international investment could be provided by a framework agreement, which would link binding standards for corporate social responsibility in key areas, such as combating bribery and cooperation in tax enforcement, with traditional investor rights based on investor protection and liberalization rules.",,

The significant shift to emerge from this review has been a commitment to being a responsible organisation. On both ethical and strategic grounds, Nirex believes it will only have a useful role to play in future radioactive waste management debates if it can show that it is a socially responsive and accountable organisation. Important commitments have already been made, and policies introduced, including a Transparency Policy, and an Environmental Policy. Over the same period, there has been a growing discourse and engagement in the UK with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). A wealth of organisations and consultants have emerged offering thought leadership and support in this area, some of whom have approached Nirex offering services. The challenge Nirex faces, however, is to understand what relevance and implications the CSR debate has for its work, and its wider commitment to responsibility. Should Nirex have a CSR strategy and produce a CSR report, or does 'responsibility' mean something different to Nirex? What would engaging in CSR mean - is there a danger that being responsible would become a stand-alone activity in the organisation, rather than a 'mainstreamed' commitment? If Nirex were to produce a CSR report, who would it be aimed at, and how would it fit alongside other corporate communications? In order to help answer these questions, and to develop a clear position and strategy, Nirex asked the Future Foundation to help facilitate input from consultants and other practitioners who have relevant experience.

The objective of the paper is to suggest a conceptual methodology with which ethics of corporate environmental management tools can be considered. The method includes two stages that are required for a shift away from the current dominant unsustainable paradigm and toward a more sustainable paradigm. The first stage is paradigmatic, metaphoric and normative. The second stage is a practical stage, which in turn, is analytic, descriptive and positive. The method is applied to common industrial metabolism tools of ecological footprints (EF), environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) and industrial ecology (IE). The application shows that all three tools can be used in business ethics, in particular, when the first stage of the method is applied to their use.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Ecological footprints; Environmental life cycle assessment; Industrial ecology",

Having failed in its attempt to compel companies to behave responsibly, corporate social responsibility has been superseded by a more consensual approach that seeks to encourage companies to behave as good corporate citizens. To view these two concepts as alternatives, however, fails to recognize the value to be gained in using them in combination. The role envisaged for corporate citizenship by this article is illustrated by an account of the United Nations Global Compact and concerns the establishment, through consensual means, of the norms necessary for an effective regime of corporate social responsibility. To this extent therefore, corporate citizenship should be viewed, not as a replacement for corporate social responsibility, but as a complement to it.","Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Global Compact Regulation; United Nations","citizenship; corporate strategy; regulatory approach; social policy; United Nations"

In a world of globalisation, with an emphasis on free trade, there are many new environmental challenges that need to be addressed. Not least, it is argued that globalisation leads to an increase in the 'weightlessness' of corporations as companies externalise more of their production activities. Since systems are essentially an internal management tool, this externalisation means that they cannot manage many of the environmental impacts of the modern corporation. In order to survive in the globalised environment and achieve business performance consistent with sustainable development, it is argued that a new emphasis must be placed on environmental supply chain management and extended producer responsibility running in parallel with new initiatives on social responsibility and fairer trading relationships. In effect the paper calls for a switch in emphasis away from systems and towards product stewardship along the whole supply chain. This should form the basis of a new competitive advantage through a new emphasis on differentiation of products and company image.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management systems; Extended producer responsibility; Fair trade; Globalisation; Product stewardship; Supply chain management",

Since the company benefits first before any obligation to donate is accrued, consumers might perceive this practice to be less altruistic than an unconditional donation to a cause. If so, CRM could backfire, injuring corporate image. This study investigated the effects of type of donation (conditional or not conditional upon corporate revenue) and reputation of the firm making the donation (firms described as scrupulous, average, or irresponsible in the discharge of their social responsibility) on consumer regard for the firm; perceived mercenary intent of the firm; and whether the social performance of the company is consistent with ""good"" management. Consumer responses were predicted based on the contrast effect and attribution theory. Results suggest that irresponsible firms increased their favor with consumers by pursuing either type of donation. The average firm enhanced its image by pursuing an unconditional donation, but a conditional donation did not damage firm image. Perception of the scrupulous firm was little changed after unconditional donation, but a scrupulous firm suffered a loss of favor by pursuing CRM.

The strength of this incentive depends on the relative share of screened portfolios, which in turn partially depends on the financial performance of the screened portfolios.

Increasingly, this seems to be the way forward as it is vital for companies and society to coexist. In this paper guidelines and criteria are explored to relate the ethical dimension to performance management in order to create inclusive value. There is a definite synergy between business excellence and good ethical practice, where the latter becomes a fundamental purpose rather than just an add-on. This is because such an approach contributes to an organisation's reputation which, there-upon, can be trusted and sustained.

The variety of prescriptions of how to be successful (effective, performing, etc.) 1 Organizational performance, organizational success and organizational effectiveness will be used interchangeably throughout this paper.1 in business is hardly comprehensible: ""Being close to the customer,"" Total Quality Management, corporate social responsibility, shareholder value maximization, efficient consumer response, management reward systems or employee involvement programs are but a few of the slogans introduced as means to increase organizational effectiveness. Management scholars have made little effort to integrate the various performance-enhancing strategies or to assess them in an orderly manner. This study classifies organizational strategies by the importance each strategy attaches to different constituencies in the firm's environment. A number of researchers divide an organization's environment into various constituency groups and argue that these groups constitute - as providers and recipients of resources - the basis for organizational survival and well-being. Some theoretical schools argue for the foremost importance of responsiveness to certain constituencies while stakeholder theory calls for a - situation-contingent - balance in these responsiveness levels. Given that maximum responsiveness levels to different groups may be limited by an organization's resource endowment or even counterbalanced, the need exists for a concurrent assessment of these competing claims by jointly evaluating the effect of the respective behaviors towards constituencies on performance. Thus, this study investigates the competing merits of implementing alternative business philosophies (e.g. balanced versus focused responsiveness to constituencies). Such a concurrent assessment provides a ""critical test"" of multiple, opposing theories rather than testing the merits of one theory (Carlsmith, Ellsworth &amp; Aronson, 1976). In the high tolerance level applied for this study (be among the top 80% of the industry) only a handful of organizations managed to sustain such a balanced strategy over the whole observation period. Continuously monitoring stakeholder demands and crafting suitable responsiveness strategies must therefore be a focus of successful business strategies.

In this trial, a Melbourne woman was awarded A$700 000 damages for smoking-attributable lung cancer when the defendant, BATA, had its case dismissed due to document destruction. In 60 commentaries from Australian national or capital city newspapers between 12 April and 9 May 2002, a total of 79 instances of eight tobacco-related frames were identified. Overall, 43% of the 79 instances were positive for tobacco control, 46% were negative for tobacco control and 11% were neutral. The most common frame that was negative for tobacco control (in 35% of articles) was the conception that smokers exert 'free will' in deciding to smoke and should therefore be personally responsible for their smoking and any disease that arises as a result of it. A related, but less commonly employed frame (in 18% of articles) was the expressed fear of a 'slippery slope' of litigation, which portrayed smoking as similar to eating fast food or other 'vices'. The most common frame that was positive for tobacco control (in 35% of articles) was the notion that the tobacco industry was 'evil' and, to a lesser extent, that the government should 'do more' to control smoking (15% of articles). These findings provide a sobering public health challenge to improve public communication efforts about the powerful forces that conspire to induce people to start smoking and keep them smoking for decades, despite a strong desire to quit. There is a need to fund public education programs and quit smoking services more adequately to address the complex education task of understanding the nature of addiction to tobacco and the enormity of the health risk.","Frame analysis; Jurisprudence; Legislation; Media advocacy; Smoking","article; Australia; case report; comparative study; decision making; female; health hazard; human; law suit; lung cancer; priority journal; responsibility; smoking; smoking cessation; tobacco dependence; tobacco industry; Australia; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Newspapers; Smoking; Social Responsibility; Tobacco Industry"

While undoubtedly of central importance, a recent comparative study of mining codes in Africa suggests that while the quality of national governance is undoubtedly a key ingredient, no amount of local governance is sufficient if not accompanied by legal and fiscal frameworks designed to meet development objectives and which are implemented in the context of good international policies and rules. Based on this study, the article suggests that the reform measures introduced largely at the recommendation of multilateral financial institutions over the last twenty years have entailed a redefinition of the role of the state that is so profound that it has no historical precedent and that this situation has not received the attention which it deserves. The comparative study of what are identified as three generations of African mining codes concludes that past reforms have the potential effect of driving down standards in areas of critical importance for social and economic development, as well as in protection of the environment in the countries concerned.","Africa; Corporate responsibility; Development; Governance; Mining codes; World Bank","governance approach; industrial policy; legal system; mining industry; regulatory framework; Africa"

EMBs have long been encouraged to diversify from inauspicious 'low value' niches; for some, the prospect of contracts with public and private sector organisations could serve as a means of facilitating this process. The advent of the Race Relations Amendment Act provides a legislative stimulus for diversity in public sector procurement. The 'corporate social responsibility' agenda, ostensibly embraced by many leading firms, provides a further impetus to re-assess diversity issues in respect of procurement. Case studies of two types of supplier diversity initiatives are drawn upon to inform this assessment: purchaser initiatives, from both the public and private sector; and intermediary or business-to-business brokerage type initiatives that attempt to facilitate the access of EMBs to potential contract opportunities. It is clear that such initiatives are at an early stage of development, and have to operate within legislative and political constraints. Nonetheless, there is still scope for the development of progressive measures; this is explored in the conclusion.",,

But to an increasing degree, low productivity resulting from the small-business structure of the Alpine region weakens the economic and social leadership of tourism. In the last few decades overcoming these difficulties often included substantial supporting of institutionalised tourism organisations by tourism policy, with the intention to bundle forces and to achieve growing global competition. Change in international tourist markets demands the pursuance of completely new strategies, particularly because the small-business structure of Alpine tourism in the past has always been the basis for its many positive effects for the local and regional population alike. By keeping its function of balancing regional economic growth, tourism policy's main responsibility for the future in the East Alpine region will be to create the prerequisites required for an adaptation to the new situation in the tourist markets. In addition, the support of tourism organisations is needed for achieving corporate success, which cannot be realised by individual entrepreneurs in the tourist industry owing to their small-business structure. The key to adaptation lies in the improvement of qualifications. This improvement should lead to the development of new skills for tourist cooperations as a basis for the strategic transition from institutionalised tourism organisations to flexible and market-oriented destination management companies. © 2003 H.

Janssen's 500 kW photovoltaic system, which generates enough energy to power more than 600 homes and reduces energy drawn for NJ.'s power grid, is a prime example of corporate citizenship or corporate social responsibility. This article is a case study of how corporate commitment at Janssen overcame financial constraints, and a truncated timeframe to Install the new system. It traces how a public private partnership between Janssen, its photovoltaic vendors and the New Jersey Clean Energy Program successfully navigated the intricacies of local construction codes that had no provision for such a large scale solar energy system, the requirements of the local power company and of the Clean Energy Program, difficulties caused by severe winter weather, and a 100-point commissioning process. Companies considering such an installation, would do well do take a long-term view of all the benefits of the technology, not just the cost savings. Benefits include reducing carbon dioxide emissions, hedging against future price increases, diversifying a company's energy portfolio, strengthening shareholder reputation, and improving their relationship with communities. For example, Janssen's rooftop system resulted in positive public reaction, especially in the local community. © 2003 NetLogex, LLC.

The notion that organizations should be attentive to the needs of constituents other than shareholders has been investigated and vigorously debated for over two decades. This has provoked an especially rich and diverse literature investigating the relationship between business and society. As a result, researchers have urged the study of the profiles and backgrounds of corporate upper echelons in order to better understand this relationship. There is ample evidence that corporations have in recent years increased the proportion of outside directors on their boards. This has been partly in reaction to increased interest in the corporate social responsiveness of business organizations and suggestions that the board of directors could play a unique role in this area. The expectation on the part of practitioners, researchers, and governmental regulators is that outside directors will advocate greater corporate responsiveness to society's needs by playing a more active role in overseeing managerial decisions. The purpose of this study is to partially fill a void in the literature by determining whether or not these expectations are justified, particularly in the service industry. Data were collected as part of a larger cross-national study of corporate social responsibility. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) of the results of a survey of 307 board members (198 outside and 109 inside directors) indicates that outside directors exhibit greater concern about the discretionary component of corporate responsibility and a weaker orientation toward economic performance. No significant differences between the two groups were observed with respect to the legal and ethical dimensions of corporate social responsibility. Some explanations as well as limited generalizations and implications are developed.",,

Arguments are presented to justify the development of a proactive strategy of corporate social responsibility for European aluminium enterprises. Distinct models of social responsibility that might be adopted by European aluminium companies as a function of differences in institutional, geographical and other contextual variables are then outlined. Empirical findings from the work on pilot sites in France reinforce our recommendations based on institutional and theoretical considerations that the 'extended stakeholder participation' model is an appropriate one for European aluminium companies to follow. The participatory approach unites 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' styles of management, and provides flexibility for innovation in response to emerging problems and new challenges.","Aluminium; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental quality; Focus groups; Indicators; Participation; Social performance; Stakeholders; Sustainable development","Aluminum; Industrial management; Performance; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Documentary analysis; Sustainable development; aluminum; corporate strategy; management practice; manufacturing; sustainable development; Europe; France"

Measuring 'return on investment' occurs at every level of operations-so why not also in the arena of Corporate Social activity? Until now, much research has focused on finding the link between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and increased business performance. Researchers have not examined the cost implications associated with the different forms of governance utilized by companies to implement their CSR activities, e.g., outsourcing through charitable contributions, developing an in-house program, or creating a more collaborative model, which benefits both the company and the partner nonprofit organization. Careful examination and evaluation of these costs will help senior management choose the governance structure that will maximize the benefits they reap from CSR activities. Drawing upon insights from organizational economics, this article develops a framework to compare the alternative modes of CSR governance and identifies the key drivers that affect governance choice, including associated costs.

Demutualisation resulted from cultural change within senior management in mutual societies, which undermined their support for the idea of mutual ownership. This cultural change was a consequence of the deeper integration of mutual societies into the retail financial services sector where a different business culture was dominant. Though government has ignored the wider social impact of demutualisation, it has in fact undermined their attempts to encourage more socially inclusive forms of delivery for personal financial services. The paper makes a case for recognition of the contribution of mutual building societies to the development of more socially responsible corporate strategies. The recent wave of demutualisations also highlights the need for mutuals to encourage greater membership involvement in the running of the organisation.",,"banking; corporate strategy; cultural change; industrial restructuring"

However, integrating sustainability thinking and practice into organizational structure is not a trivial task and it requires a vision, commitment and leadership. It also requires a systems approach with an appropriate management framework that enables design, management and communication of corporate sustainability policies. This paper proposes a general framework for a Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) which enables translation of the general principles of sustainable development into corporate practice by providing a systematic, step-by-step guidance towards a more sustainable business. Developed in collaboration with industry, it is designed to help improve the triple bottom line through sustainable economic development and environmental protection, while encouraging socially responsible business values. To facilitate an easier integration into the organizational structure, the CSMS follows the familiar models of Total Quality and Environmental Management Systems. While in principle applicable to industry in general, the system is flexible enough to be adapted to the specific needs of individual companies and the contexts in which they operate. Application of the CSMS is illustrated on suitable examples throughout.","Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability; Management systems; Sustainability indicators; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable development","Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Industrial management; Public policy; Total quality management; Costs; Integration; Product design; Risks; Systems analysis; Corporate sustainability; Corporate social responsibility; Management systems; Sustainability indicators; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable development"

By drawing on three different sectors, one business-to-business service, one business-to-customer service, and one manufacturing, we have enabled the consideration of sectoral differences. We find sector to play an important part in relation to business practices and social capital. Our inclusion of SMEs from Germany and the United Kingdom has called attention to cultural, institutional and economic aspects of two regions of Europe and how they can influence SME social capital. Social capital is found to be influenced by context and, in particular, institutional arrangements. In analysing the data we note particular areas of interest from the point of view of SMEs and social capital as being: formal engagement, networking within sectors, networking across sectors, volunteerism and giving to charity, and finally a focus on why people engage. We conclude that there is a considerable amount of further research needed on social capital, SME's and business ethics.","Charitable giving; Civic engagement; Corporate social responsibility; Germany; Local community; Networks; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Social capital; United Kingdom; Volunteerism",

Yet is it able to benefit poor producers and workers in developing economies, particularly those who outside of industrial production systems? This paper examines how ethical trade is being applied to smallholder tea, coffee and cocoa growers in Asia, Africa and South America. It shows that many of the primary concerns among growers are not included in ethical trade standards. It argues that, although civil-society organisations have influenced the direction and scope of such standards (e.g. through partnerships with companies), the cultural and ideational dimensions to ethical trade impose limits on what can be modified and improved. Furthermore, the standards overlook critical aspects of business practice and their consequences for growers. The consequences of this are not only potentially detrimental for ethical trade's intended beneficiaries but also for this system's corporate supporters. No matter what the business case may be for ethical trade, ultimately its success depends on accurately identifying and addressing the well-being of those in developing countries. This paper shows not only how far we are from achieving that goal but also some of the hitherto unrecognised reasons.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethical trade; Fair trade; International development; Supply chains","cocoa; coffee; ethics; international trade; tea; Theobroma cacao"

In stakeholder literature knowledge can be found, e.g. on various stakeholder categorizations, that could be useful for the modelling issue. However, the normative issue remains unresolved. Additionally, the modelling of the so-called stakeholder category 'the affected' further complicates this issue. Nevertheless, from a normative perspective, this group holds justified interests in aspects of organizational activity and its members are, for that reason, legitimate stakeholders. In this article it is explored to what extent critical systems heuristics can help in resolving the managerial problem of identifying stakeholders. Critical systems heuristics is a modelling methodology in which the normative aspect of modelling is crucial.

We find that large firms mostly prefer an integrity strategy to foster ethical behaviour in the organisation, whereas small enterprises prefer a dialogue strategy. Both large and small firms make least use of a compliance strategy that focuses on controlling and sanctioning the ethical behaviour of workers. The size of the business is found to have a positive impact on the use of several instruments, like code of conduct, ISO certification, social reporting, social handbook and confidential person. Also being a subsidiary of a larger firm has a significant positive influence on the use of instruments. The most popular instrument used by small firms is to let one member of the board be answerable for ethical questions, which fits the informal culture of most small firms. With respect to sectorial differences, we find that firms in the metal manufacturing and construction sectors are more actively using formal instruments than firms in the financial service sector and retail sector. The distinction between family and non-family firms hardly affects the use of instruments.","Comparison of small and large firms; Ethics instruments; Ethics strategies; Organisation of corporate social responsibility",

The main questions at issue are why companies have chosen to use the GRI guidelines and how this has affected corporate social responsibility and environmental management. From interviews with all Swedish companies that use the guidelines, we have found that companies produce CSRs mainly to seek organizational legitimacy, and that the main reason for use of the GRI guidelines is an expectation of increasing credibility of the CSR, but also that it provides a template for how to design a report. Moreover, we have found that the CSR report and the GRI guidelines are of more help for internal than external communication at this stage of development. It could help corporations to learn about themselves and to see what has actually been done in the organization. In all, the GRI guidelines would have the potential for gaining visibility and control of the triple bottom line on a corporate level, but they are in need of further development, not least in relation to the issue of verification.

On the other hand, firms may use ISO 14001 as a mechanism to reorient their strategies, so that a clear signal is sent about the firm's change in strategic positioning. This paper aims to identify the most likely explanation for early adopters of ISO 14001. Using a matched pair design, we test these alternative explanations on a sample of US firms that certified for ISO 14001 in the first two years after its introduction. In particular, we tested whether ISO 14001 was used to reinforce or reorient firm strategies in respect to the natural environment, corporate social responsibility, quality, and internationalization. We found that firms that certified early for ISO 14001 had considerable environmental legitimacy and a strong international presence. We also found that the firm's commitment to corporate social responsibility and quality were not significantly different between certified and non-certified firms. These findings suggest that early adopters of ISO 14001 leaned towards reinforcing rather than reorienting their firm strategy, which calls into question the ultimate reach of ISO 14001.","Early adoption; ISO 14001; Strategic realignment; Strategic reinforcement",

The perspective is essential for their license to operate and forms the basis for business principles and practices. The lack of internationally accepted reporting standards on what, when and where to report makes it difficult to assess sustainability, however. Moreover, measuring tools providing information on SCP are only the first step towards sustainability. To prevent negative effects of operations being transferred from one company to another, the second step is the development of a system-based approach for all companies that contribute to an end product. This paper presents the findings of a study about the use of environmental indicators for food production and proposes a measuring method for environmental sustainability in food production systems. The study shows that environmental SCP often focuses on events at a local level. The enormous number of indicators found in the literature generates too much data that often provide no additional knowledge on the environmental sustainability of a system. Moreover, although environmental research has addressed many aspects of sustainability, it has often ignored interactions. Overall environmental implications of food production are therefore poorly understood. The proposed measuring method uses three indicators that address global environmental issues: the use of energy (from both fossil and renewable sources), land and water. The systemic approach can calculate trade-offs along supply chains that make up a production system. The use of the method implies an extension of environmental SCP towards the overall performance of a production system. The final outcome is expressed in three performance indicators: the total land, energy and water requirement per kilogram of available food. For companies, the data generated can be used to compare trends over time, to compare results with targets and to benchmark a company against others. For consumers, data can be used to compare the environmental effects of various foods. The method is also applicable to other business sectors. The study is part of a multidisciplinary project on the scientific modeling and measuring of SCP involving economic, social and environmental dimensions. Acceptance of the measuring methods developed may be a powerful contribution towards creating sustainable business practices. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

How should executives balance a firm's very real economic imperative to maximize profitability with its hypothetical moral imperative to improve society? To provide one answer, the author draws on his experience as president of an economic-development company, IBEC. Viewing profit as ""an essential discipline and measurer of economic success"" but not sole corporate goal,"" the company activity invested in social programs that met four criteria: They served a need of the local population; they required innovative approaches; they made sense on economic grounds; and they respected the social norms of the community. Such civic-minded efforts, the author argues in this prescient 1971 article, not only improve people's lives but also create the foundation for more affluent and dynamic markets - markets that ultimately produce greater profits for business. For example, one of IBEC's earliest ventures was directed toward solving Venezuela's problems in retail food marketing. Many important items were unavailable at the small stores where people shopped. So in 1949, working with local partners, IBEC opened a supermarket. Supermarkets soon changed the food-buying habits of the nation, and the initiative helped alter patterns of food distribution and created the reliable demand needed to establish a host of local suppliers. Return on IBEC's investment, and that of its local partners, was most satisfactory, the author reports. The road to meeting a public need-especially a major one - is rarely easy, the author says.

The research highlights significant associations between the allocation of responsibility for community involvement within the firm, its industry and the extent of its community involvement activities. Consistent with the view that managerial structures may play a significant role in the implementation of community initiatives, the results identify significant variations in community involvement policies across alternative organizational forms. However, important similarities in corporate community policies across alternative structures are also shown to exist suggesting that corporate community involvement activities may be influenced by the preferences of societal stakeholders.","Corporate community involvement; Corporate social responsibility; Organizational structure; Stakeholder models",

This deficiency has contributed to the criticism that company managers do not include environmental impacts in the internal decision-making process. The accounting profession has not developed effective environmental reporting guidelines. This situation contributes to a second problem: the apparent inability of corporate reports to provide useful information to external parties. It has been suggested that by using nonmarket valuation methodologies, financial statements can be used to measure progress toward sustainable development. Nonmarket valuations are not generally accepted by the accounting profession. They are too subjective to support effective decisions, and too costly to obtain. Furthermore, demand for this sort of information appears small. Some of these issues may be resolved over time. The most serious challenge, however, concerns how enhanced financial reports would be used. Financial statements are supposed to help investors assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. A substantial portion of environmental value is based on nonuse benefits, much of which will never be realized in company cash flows. In other words, the role of financial statements would have to change. Furthermore, since there is no general agreement as to the meaning of ""sustainable development,"" efforts to operationalize the term have been fraught with difficulty. Moreover, monetization of environmental values could jeopardize their preservation, leaving some to question the overall objective of this form of reporting. For these reasons, while it is to be hoped that better reporting of environmental impacts will be forthcoming, the greatest advances will likely be outside the financial statements themselves.","Environmental accounting; Social responsibility reporting","Decision making; Finance; Managers; Sustainable development; Financial statements; Environmental impact; decision making; economic aspect; environmental impact; environmental protection; financial management; review; Accounting; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Organizational Culture; Organizational Objectives"

Those that do take such an approach commit talent and know-how, not just dollars, to a pressing but carefully chosen social need and then tell the world about the cause and their service to it. Through the association, both the business and the cause benefit in ways they could not otherwise. Organizations such as Avon, ConAgra Foods, and Chevrolet have recognized that a sustained cause-branding program can improve their reputations, boost their employees' morale, strengthen relations with business partners, and drive sales. And the targeted causes receive far more money than they could have from direct corporate gifts alone. The authors examine these best practices and offer four principles for building successful cause-branding programs. First, they say, a company should select a cause that advances its corporate goals. That is, unless the competitive logic for supporting the cause is clear, a company shouldn't even consider putting its finite resources behind it. Second, a business should commit to a cause before picking its charitable partners. Otherwise, a cause-branding program may become too dependent on its partners. Third, a company should put all its assets to work, especially its employees. It should leverage the professional skills of its workers as well as its other assets such as distribution networks. And fourth, a company should promote its philanthropic initiatives through every possible channel. In addition to using the media, it should communicate its efforts through the Web, annual reports, direct mail, and so on. Cause branding is a way to turn the obligations of corporate citizenship into a valuable asset.

It argues that companies' social and environmental responsibilities are increasing, due to global changes in the way the role of business is perceived, South African policy developments, as well as a strong 'business case' for companies to actively support sustainable development - beyond philanthropy and impact mitigation. Partnerships between companies, the government and civil society are introduced as a potentially effective and efficient strategy for CSR. They are no panacea, however, and require a commitment to local communities' rights to informed prior consent and authentic participation. CSR hence presents mining companies with significant challenges. Given committed leadership and the right approach, it can entail important opportunities as well. Particular attention will need to be given to potential tensions between the international debate surrounding CSR, on the one hand, and local South African development challenges and companies' responses to them, on the other.",,"corporate strategy; environmental economics; environmental planning; mining industry; sustainable development; South Africa"

Following on the first article by Hamann in this issue, which considered the business perspective, this article considers how civil society should respond to the CSR and partnership concepts, with reference to the South African context. Firstly, a critical view of CSR emphasises the need to consider underlying motivations for business to embrace and perpetuate the CSR concept. These may relate to accommodation - the implementation of cosmetic changes to business practice in order to preclude bigger changes - and legitimisation - the influence by business over popular and policy-related discourse in order to define what questions may be asked and what answers are feasible. The second part of the article describes important benefits of the CSR concept for civil society groups, in terms of increased power and rights and hence better negotiating positions. This, however, requires that non-governmental organisations and others proactively engage in shaping the CSR debates, by insisting, inter alia, that CSR be underpinned by corporate accountability. Finally, the article argues that partnerships with business can indeed be beneficial to civil society groups, but that a critical position needs to be maintained within this cooperative approach, namely 'critical cooperation'. Such partnerships will require the strategic use of power-, rights- and interest-based negotiation. Following a brief overview of some recent South African experiences in the mining and chemicals sectors, the article concludes by pointing out the important role of the government in facilitating fair and effective partnerships.",,"civil society; corporate strategy; governance approach; partnership approach"

For some firms, CSR may be a major influence on corporate strategy. Companies making a substantial commitment to CSR - because of a business or a normative case - are likely to find that this involves major challenges with respect to the formulation and implementation of CSR strategy, not least because of the uncertainties inevitably associated with determining a firm's societal obligations.",,

These conventional views of corporate citizenship are argued to contribute little or nothing to existing notions of corporate social responsibility and corporate philanthropy. The paper then proposes a new direction, which particularly exposes the element of ""citizenship"". Being a political concept, citizenship can only be reasonably understood from that theoretical angle. This suggests that citizenship consists of a bundle of rights conventionally granted and protected by governments of states. However, the more that governmental power and sovereignty have come under threat, the more that relevant political functions have gradually shifted towards the corporate sphere - and it is at this point where ""corporate"" involvement into ""citizenship"" becomes an issue. Consequently, ""corporate citizens"" are substantially more than fellow members of the same community who cosily rub shoulders with other fellow citizens while bravely respecting those other citizens' rights and living up to their own responsibility as corporations - as the conventional rhetoric wants us to believe. Behind this relatively innocuous mask then, the true face of corporate citizenship suggests that the corporate role in contemporary citizenship is far more profound, and ultimately in need of urgent reappraisal.","Business and government; Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Globalization; Human rights; Stakeholder theory",

However, the larger social mandate for business has changed, represented by the rise of language such as ""sustainable development"", ""corporate social responsibility"" (CSR) and ""stakeholder groups."" Nevertheless, the theoretical shift implied by the use of such language has not occurred. Issues of sustainable development and CSR continue to be justified in the terms of neoclassical economic theory through the rationalization of ""doing well by doing good"". Within this economic paradigm, CSR cannot move beyond enlightened self-interest (acting in socially responsible ways in order to further one's own ends) because all behavior must be justified economically. This implies that corporate socially responsible behavior will simply cease when it becomes uneconomic, regardless of the impact on interrelated systems which in turn will re-impact the business realm. Faced with bitter realities arising from complex interactions among social, political, cultural, economic and natural environments, we may better comprehend and negotiate these problems by moving out of a neoclassical economic justification of the stake-holder model of the corporation to an inter-systems model, shifting from a narrow comprehension of a single economic independent system analyzed apart from its larger context to a fuller understanding of business as one of a number of interrelated systems. Operational differences between the old and new mandates are described, and two ways to practically shift towards the new mandate are identified as a modified version of scenario planning and the introduction of the voice of the critic.","Business and society; Corporate social responsibility; Enlightened self-interest; Neoclassical economic theory; Stakeholder theory",

The hypothesis tested is that the production of good quality corporate environmental reports (CERs) benefits company share price, by demonstrating to investors an awareness of risk, liability, legislation and opportunities as well as providing a collection of policy, impacts, temporal trends, targets and commitment. Some other studies in this area have concluded that a positive relationship exists between corporate environmental management and performance (including environmental reporting) and share value. The results of this paper differ however, and show that on average, the production of environmental reports by FTSE100 companies (in the energy and utilities and financial services sectors) has not lead to improved historical share price performance when compared to non-reporting companies, although there is strong evidence for reduced volatility of share price. Results for sector performance varied from those obtained from individual company level. The two companies assessed as producing the best reports in their industry sector outperformed both the FTSEl00 benchmark, and many of their competitors for the five-year period studied. Whilst there are many benefits to be gained by listed companies through environmental reporting, such as enhancing image and improving public and investor opinion, a positive attitude to the environment, as demonstrated through environmental reporting, can provide an indication of a truly strategic approach to business. Yet there are so many factors involved, it is not possible from the results to conclude that environmental reporting supports share value.","Content analysis; Corporate environmental reporting; Corporate social responsibility; Ethical investing; Financial performance; Ftse4good; Share value","environmental assessment; environmental economics; price dynamics; stock market; United Kingdom"

These principles may relate to aspects that are as diverse as trade practices, corporate conduct and ethics, environmental standards, working conditions and human rights, and apply to MNCs' subsidiaries and their subcontractors. Many Canadian companies have adopted such codes. These codes of conduct cannot be considered as spaces for the protection of the freedom of association since, according to an ILO study, only 15 percent of the codes contain references to association, organization and collective bargaining rights. However, they can be considered as spaces for the exercise of the freedom of association. Studies by a group of researchers of which we are members show that, in fact, codes of conduct involve collective relations. These collective relations do not correspond to the institutionalized labour relations of collective bargaining but rather bring several actors together, involve several issues, and combine several means of action. The latter are not limited to collective bargaining and strikes, but involve the presentation of shareholders' proposals, the organization of boycott and picketing campaigns, or the adoption of legal strategies that raise doubts about the MNC's respect for its commitments abroad. These means of action make it possible to intervene in areas where the MNC is vulnerable, i.e., its corporate image or the image of its product as well as its finances. State law is not absent from these social dynamics. Rules of law govern shareholders' proposals or the information that the company is required or not required to divulge, the secondary boycott and picketing campaigns, and the MNC's responsibility. This paper briefly sets out these rules and attempts to identify the opportunities that they create and the limits that they impose on actors, in particular trade unions, who wish to act on the MNC's new sources of vulnerability. The rules of corporate law will be examined first. The amendments made in 2001 to the Canada Business Corporations Act regarding the rules governing the shareholders' proposals, the proposals of the Canadian Democracy and Corporate Accountability Commission as well as the creation in Europe of the Statute for a European Company reveal the striking differences between the courses of action favoured in Europe and those proposed in Canada to integrate social concerns into corporate law. While the European model favours one actor - workers - whom it recognizes, regulating their representation and participation within the company, the aim of the Canadian proposals is to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders in the company - and not only those of workers - are taken into account by company managers. The evolving law related to freedom of expression also has an impact on the means of international trade union action. Codes of conduct are often a response to the campaigns led by trade unions and other civil society groups against the behaviour or the effects of the activities of a given company on the living conditions of populations or workers, or on the environment. These campaigns are based on strategies centred on the information about the company or its products and may take the form of a boycott or picketing, traditional union measures, if there ever were. What makes these means novel is that they are used independently of collective bargaining or recourse to a strike. Two recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada have cleared up any uncertainties about the legality of the trade unions' means of international action. These decisions must be interpreted alongside other decisions where the Supreme Court of Canada has had to interpret the freedom of expression of consumers or the limits to the freedom of expression established by the legal principles for defamation. This is the legal effect of the fact that trade unions are treated as any other civil society actor. Lastly, common law suggests that codes of conduct, which are assimilated into companies' internal regulations, could have legal effects. Codes of conduct can be considered as internal regulations that correspond to the multinational scale of companies. The analysis of their legal effects must take into account the fact that these codes contain extraneous factors, which raises the question of the relevance of the rules of private international law under the Civil Code of Quebec to ensure their application. These developments suggest that codes of conduct do not exist in a ""legal vacuum"" and that an in-depth examination could lead to the development of a legal strategy with as much impact as those which were in force in the United States and allowed foreign workers to sue American companies over actions committed abroad, even though practical and legal reasons make the widespread recourse to such a strategy difficult. Viewed from this perspective, the rules of corporate law, constitutional law of freedom of expression and civil law appear to represent legal resources which provide new means of international trade union action. This inevitably raises the issue of the role of labour law in the protection or promotion of new modes of exercising the freedom of association. However, it must be said that the law of collective labour relations does not constitute a solid basis for developing these means of international trade union action. As strikes occur in the framework of the law of collective labour relations, it is very difficult to stage an international solidarity strike.",,

It also presents a framework that outlines the CSR processes and management prospects. Results showed that Finnish companies are progressively managing CSR. This newly revived thinking about social responsibility is viewed as an issue traced back from Finland's history of industrial development. There is no general definition of CSR; however, various concepts are connoted into it. Driven by several factors, CSR is developing gradually as indicated by the positive responses and initiatives of the companies. CSR management and practices towards employees, suppliers, community and customers are well defined locally based generally on established socially responsible behavior which could be articulated by laws and regulations, corporate values and business ethics. However, managing CSR with a global scope, problems such as; lack of information and structured management system, different views and interpretations, supply chain complexities, overlap with environmental issues, etc. often lead some companies to manage CSR haphazardly. Views and management of CSR are also influenced by some distinct Finnish cultural attributes. An initial conceptual framework for CSR is drawn reflecting the current practices and prospects for management strategies. Such framework can be used in organizing and streamlining CSR elements for effective management approaches and measuring of performance. It could be expected that in due time, the efforts of the companies will become more evident, organized and systematically managed.","Corporate social responsibility and CSR management",

In this article the differences between the management systems approach of the nineties, and Corporate Social Responsibility are analysed. An analysis is structured around three business principles that are relevant for CSR and management systems: (1) doing things right the first time, (2) doing the right things, and (3) continuous improvement and innovation. Basically CSR is focussing on the second principle, and management systems focus on the first. However, CSR is very likely to build on the management systems as well. From a CSR point of view, the existing generation of management systems with their focus on rational control (= doing things right) can only be of limited use in the development of CSR. However, the preventive rationalities of management systems are important. Values and the principle doing the right things is extremely relevant for CSR. This goes far beyond the present generation of ISO type management systems; opportunities stem from building on TQM approaches like the EFQM Business Excellence model. Continuous improvement and innovation is a permanent challenge underlying the two other business principles, and requires both individual and organisational learning processes. In the present generation of management systems, continuous improvement mainly addresses rational prevention, barely the value aspects of business. For the further development and implementation of CSR, each of the three business management principles are vital. There is a need for a new generation of management systems that addresses the values at stake in strategic decision-making, both at company level and in the behaviour of individuals, while the rationalities of prevention and anticipation are still relevant.

It then explores four versions of corporate social responsibility (CSR): the conditions under which CSR is squeezed out by the dominance of financial pressures; the embrace of CSR as a form of public relations so as to allow business to continue as usual; the adoption within the firm of new forms of measurement and incentives to motivate increased attention to the ethical, social and environmental impacts; and finally CSR as a dialogue across the corporate boundary with those most vulnerable to the effects of corporate conduct.

We identify eight possible cultural frames that may be used to motivate corporate action on social initiatives, and we illustrate the use of one frame through a case study of a high-technology manufacturer addressing a particular environmental problem. We use the case to identify framing tactics which proponents of social initiatives can use to best advance such issues in their organizations. These include using the metrics and language of relevant functional groups to assign responsibility for the problems, engaging the standard routines or approaches used in such groups, and using the culturally appropriate public and/or private channels to communicate the issue, eventually gaining allies in these groups.

Bear markets. Corporate scandals. The events of this past year have prompted intense soul-searching in many quarters and led us, in this year's list of the best business ideas, to reassess some of the most basic assumptions about strategy, organizations, and leadership. We began by reconsidering the role of the leader. Whether the boss is a hero or villain, discussions of leadership focus almost exclusively on the CEO. But attention also needs to be paid to the other people who make organizations work, not only to the corporate boards that oversee CEOs but to the followers--to their responsibilities, their power, and their obligation not to follow flawed leaders. And we considered the fate of soft issues, like emotional intelligence, in hard times. It's tempting to dismiss them when your employees will do anything just to keep their jobs. But hard times are good times to employ such tools on yourself. They can arm you with the self-awareness you need to understand, anticipate, and outwit your enemies. Where tools may fail, an attitude adjustment may be what's needed. Despite valiant efforts to lead change and eliminate inefficiencies, organizations stay messy. Perhaps it's better to learn to live with messiness and even focus on its benefits, one of which may be growth. Not the meteoric, effortless illusion we indulged in during the 1990s, but significant gains nonetheless. These can come when managers embrace messiness not just within their organizations but along the boundaries of the firm, blurring the line between their own core assets and functions and those of other companies. There's growth potential, too, in considering the company as a portfolio of opportunities--but only if managers can sell off poorly performing business units as easily as they've been shedding ailing stocks of late.",,"administrative personnel; article; commercial phenomena; creativity; human; leadership; organization; organization and management; personnel management; persuasive communication; psychology; social behavior; United States; Administrative Personnel; Commerce; Creativeness; Humans; Leadership; Organizational Innovation; Organizational Objectives; Personnel Management; Persuasive Communication; Psychology, Industrial; Social Responsibility; United States"

Inasmuch as these events have brought ethical questions about business to the forefront in the media and public consciousness as never before, they are of signal importance for the field of business ethics. I offer some observations and conjectures about the bearing of the recent scandals on the literature on business ethics. I defend the following contentions: 1. Recent events reveal serious weaknesses of the stakeholder theory about the social responsibilities of business which lacks prohibitions against fraud and deception. This is a glaring deficiency of standard versions of the stakeholder theory, but it is easily remedied by adding explicit prohibitions against fraud and deception. In addition, recent events highlight the stakeholder theory's very naive and unrealistic hopes and expectations for business executives as moral arbiters and agents of social improvement. 2. Recent events do not constitute an objection to the shareholder theory about the social responsibilities of business, however, these events make evident the implausibility of strong versions of the invisible hand theory. 3. Schemes of payment and reward often create perverse incentives for individuals to engage in unethical conduct. 4. Both the shareholder theory and the stakeholder theory need to add a constraint that requires executives to respect the professional obligations of employees.",,

A critical and provocative approach can generate discussion and debate. Three main points of critique are presented toward the current efforts in the literature to measure corporate contributions to economic, social and ecological sustainability. First, the use of the concepts of eco-efficiency and eco-efficacy in measuring corporate contributions to sustainability are criticized from the viewpoint of the complementarity relation of human-manufactured capital, natural capital and social sustaining functions. Second, the use of measures that focus on an individual process or an individual company are reconsidered with an approach to industrial and firm networks. Third, the use of the monetary value is reconsidered, e.g. by suggesting an approach based on physical material and energy flows and on a new paradigmatic foundation for social responsibility.

Providing a methodologically more rigorous review than previous efforts, we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 studies (which represent the population of prior quantitative inquiry) yielding a total sample size of 33,878 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is likely to pay off, although the operationalizations of CSP and CFP also moderate the positive association. For example, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators, and CSP reputation indices are more highly correlated with CFP than are other indicators of CSP. This meta-analysis establishes a greater degree of certainty with respect to the CSP-CFP relationship man is currently assumed to exist by many business scholars.","Business ethics; Correlation analysis; Environmental management; Reputation; Social responsibility; Stakeholder theory",

Corporations have accepted this notion provided that it is exercised voluntarily. It has also been argued that corporations can do well by doing good, and that good ethics is good business. This paper presents an alternative viewpoint by demonstrating that while voluntary socially responsible conduct is desirable, it plays a rather small role in inspiring good corporate conduct. Instead, (a) it is the external economic-competitive conditions that define the parameters and opportunities for good corporate conduct; and (b) the values and traditions of the corporations, and their perceived risk in exploiting those opportunities, that influence the extent of a corporation's socially responsible conduct. The framework presented here analyzes certain market-competitive conditions, which determine the scope and direction of socially responsible corporate conduct, and the instruments available to society to enhance ethical corporate conduct. It suggests that from society's perspective, we should move away from the notion of corporate social responsibility and toward corporate social accountability. Most modern economies operate under conditions of imperfect competition where corporations gain above-normal profits, i.e., market rent, from market imperfections. Therefore, corporations should be held accountable for a more equitable distribution of these above-normal profits with other groups, e.g., customers, employees, etc., who were deprived of their market-based gains because of market imperfections and corporate power. Three approaches are suggested for measuring corporate accountability through corrections. These are: Information imbalance, bargaining power imbalance, and, adjudication, remedy and relief imbalance.","Corporate social accountability; Corporate social responsibility; Globalization; Good corporation; Imperfect markets; Stakeholders",

In responding to the UK Government's agenda, some oil and gas enterprises have now implemented this environmental management system. This article examines the implementation of ISO 14001 in the first batch of oil and gas enterprises to have done so. Through undertaking structured face-to-face interviews with senior corporate staff in eight firms this article examines the drivers, implementation barriers and the benefits accrued from their participation in this management system.

Such corporate social responsiveness will encourage employees' collaboration and could distinguish the company from other organizations. We have tried empirically to test the existence of a significant and positive relationship between organizational results and the institutionalization of a social responsiveness toward employees. To this end, we carried out a study in the Spanish savings bank sector to analyse the strategic value of corporate responsiveness toward employees from the resource-based view. Our results seem to show that those savings banks that have institutionalized high-commitment practices toward employees have greater profitability.","Employees; High commitment; Profitability; Resource-based view; Social responsiveness",

How the company deals with potentially conflicting stakeholder interests is what constitutes its corporate social responsibility. In this perspective, it is possible to identify two broad approaches to CSR: internally focused approaches dealing with corporate mission, values, culture and desired business behaviour - in other words, business ethics programs; and externally focused approaches dealing with social, or external stakeholder issues, i.e. social accountability programs. Both approaches can generate significant business benefits but also bear a number of potential risks and limitations. This paper presents a critical examination of strengths and weaknesses of internally and externally focused approaches to CSR and introduces the idea of a balanced approach to CSR to support its integration into traditional business management systems and processes. © 2003 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","accountability; business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; CSR management; social",

The point of departure of this paper from the earlier study is the illustration of how the framework, derived from the case studies, could be applied to resolve future conflicts of interest. The focus of the analysis is on the dynamics of shareholder engagement involving the complex interplay between the ‘balance of reason’ and ‘the balance of power’ on issues of corporate social responsibility. The thesis is postulated that, contrary to appearances in situations of conflict, the decisive long-term factor for sustainable business performance is the rationality of the proposal in question rather than the power of shareholders to enforce it. © 2003 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","corporate governance; corporate social responsibility; Shareholder engagement; socially responsible investment",

The underlying theme of the stakeholder concept is corporate social responsibility, which relates to the obligations that an organisation has towards other parties. Major stakeholders include employees, shareholders, customers and society with the latter depending on and expecting much from business. Their influence on corporate values ought to be recognised and assessed. The integration of stakeholder value with business performance measurement and management is explored and related to the concept of total productivity. Thus, total productivity is featured as being an important generator of such a value through the development of the index of Super Total Productivity (STP). It is based on the total productivity paradigm as well as on an organisation’s major stakeholder satisfaction metrics, these being customer, employee and societal dimensions; examples are given. The ingredients of good business performance are accentuated in the light of this all-embracing STP by taking into account an inclusive approach.

That is, to analyse more the ‘big picture’, which incorporates the important notion that the perceptions of the customer ought to equate to those of the supplier. Inevitably, quality and its continuous improvement take time. What is required is a long-term commitment to the fundamentals to be perceived more as a process than a ‘one-off plan.

Results from 4 laboratory studies indicate that perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) are affected by consumers' elaboration levels. Consumer perceptions of CSR are more favorable for cause promotions, which do not receive much elaboration, than they are for advocacy advertising, which prompts more elaboration. In addition, perceived congruence between the sponsor and the social issue is shown to moderate these effects: Higher congruence between the sponsor and social issue increases favorable ratings of CSR for cause promotions but only if elaboration on the sponsorship activity is facilitated. On the other hand, lower congruence increases favorable ratings of CSR for advocacy advertising as long as elaboration on the sponsorship is not constrained. We also found that higher congruence enhances CSR ratings if participants are primed to focus their attention on the sponsor brand, whereas lower congruence enhances CSR if participants are primed to focus their attention on the social issue.",,

The mining industry has adequately supplied minerals and contributed to the society's well-being in the past, maintaining competitiveness by productivity increases and economies of scale. The known and predicted geological resource base can provide a sufficient mineral supply in the foreseeable future. The long-term intergeneration contract for sustainable development challenges the minerals industry to increase its eco-efficiency by increasing resource utilization ratios and reducing environmental impacts. The mineral industry has made considerable progress in these fields during the past two decades, but technological approaches alone will not suffice to retain the ""license to operate"". - Access to viable mineral deposits is one of the key factors for maintaining corporate sustainability in the future, the prerequisite for mineral production. Access is being increasingly limited by changes in our society's value system.- In addition to technological, economic and ecological aspects, the mining industry, therefore, has to further develop corporate citizenship and engage in active corporate social responsibility in order to gain the ""social license"" to develop its operations.- Being accepted as a ""good neighbour"" requires a change in behaviour, but also provides opportunities for achieving a sustained triple bottom line: economic, environmental and social success. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) will lead to voluntary and site-specific agreements at community level. Centralized approaches to regulate CSR would not be conducive to the process.

Many retailers understand the importance of sustainable development strategies and have taken steps to satisfy latent demand for ""green"" products. One instrument supporting sustainable development strategies is corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Civil society development in this time is very much related to the humanitarian crisis caused by the War and involvement of international and foreign organisations. Beside that, civil society in Croatia has a poor tradition, its development has been hindered by half a century of communism and totalitarian ideology, coupled with the lack of experience with the concept of freedom of association. In the second part of the article, using the concept of CIVICUS Index on Civil Society Project, we analyse four dimensions of civil society in Croatia: the structure of civil society; the legal, political and socio-cultural space in which civil society operates in the larger regulatory, legal and social environment; the values civil society represents and propagates and the impact civil society has on social and community development as well as on the public policy process. The most critical area of civil society development in Croatia is related to the limited space it has to operate in, as defined by the legislative, political and social-cultural framework. With regard to legislation we do need to deal more with public policy issues trying to institutionalise a place for CSOs social capital building activities. The negative attitude of the state, restrictive legislation, a lack of social responsibility on the part of the corporate sector and the absence of a culture of volunteering and public spiritedness are vital problems. Regarding their impact, civil society organizations seem, at least in their own perceptions, to contribute significantly to solving specific social, economic and political problems and furthering the public good. However, influence on the public policy process is very limited. In the concluding part we provide some recommendation for the future development of civil society in Croatia.",,

It is a reactive measure, and steadily declining LTIFRs around the world have failed to be accompanied by a similar reduction in the fatality rate. This paper confronts the industry with the attitudes of some mining managers, such as one that allowed fatalities to occur in the case of a gold mining company at a rate of one death per 150 000 ounces of gold produced while claiming their safety record has improved, as shown by a falling LTIFR, and viewing fatality reductions as a long-term goal instead of an immediate priority. A quantum shift in management attitudes is required to focus on proactive measurements to detect the indicators of an impending disaster, and to predict conditions conducive to fatalities. Corporate CEOs are challenged to attend the funerals of all workers killed in the workplace. CEOs who fail to attend such funerals send a message to employees that the CEO's priorities lie elsewhere, and that profits take priority over workers' lives. The dichotomy of whether mining companies are run for the benefit of shareholders or whether companies owe social responsibility to the community is examined. The role of individual responsibility for personal safety is examined, together with the psychology of employees in the mining industry. A number of proactive measurable indicators are suggested to stimulate discussion on developing robust measuring tools to predict and therefore prevent fatalities.",,

Tragedies such as these poisonings are not accidents, but foreseeable, and therefore preventable.

These issues are usually referred to as ""green"" issues. This paper presents a detailed discussion of global green issues in the context of a number of environments that include the socioeconomic, political, technological, and competitive arenas. The discussion is based on an attempt to integrate two conceptual models by Maslow (Maslow, A., 1954. Motivation and Personality. Harper & Row, New York) and Cateora (Cateora, P.R., 1983. International Marketing, 4th. ed. Irwin, Chicago, IL). The goal is to bring together both a microlevel perspective of the individual consumer and a macrolevel perspective of business through analysis in multiple environments that are affected by green issues. This integration is viewed conceptually as a recursive system of mutually reinforcing causes and effects at the micro- and macrolevels.The leitmotiv throughout the paper is that ""it isn't easy being green,"" either for consumers, activists, corporate leaders and managers, or public policymakers. Practical examples are presented to support and illustrate the discussion. The main finding is that a new approach is needed to business in general through a new dominant social paradigm (DSP) and to international business in particular in order to achieve both sustainable development and sustainable consumption. In conclusion, the importance of individual responsibility and action by consumers and managers alike is underlined. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Learning and knowledge is one of the elementary conditions of human existence. As much as it was true in the whole history, so more it is true in the time of the oncoming information society. Knowledge creates the basis of human capital that is the major component of the information society development. This society is based mostly on the permanent lifetime education. On the other hand, unequal chances and different approach towards education in the present world, but personable eligibilities and ambitions as well, leads to a polarization of the society between privileged intellectuals and uneducated masses. A prevention of further deepening of the ""scissors effect"" is possible mainly by ensuring the access to education in maximally sufficient extent for all spheres of the population. But this is - besides social, ethic and political problem - the problem of economy, thus the problem of financing a lifetime education. Its solving consists in two main assumptions, namely the financing sources and related rate of participation of concerned subjects. Considering the first assumption, it can be stated - and it is almost generally true - that the financing sources are limited. Regarding the second assumption, the willingness of the individual subjects/entities (individuals, firms, state, education institutions...) is limited by their partial interests. A constitution of an effective model of the lifetime education system requires the consideration of all of its economic, political and social relations. Education cannot exist isolated from the economic and social changes. And it is exactly the lifetime education system, which represents an extremely complicated, expertly and financially highintensive problem and process. A participation of the individual subjects on the financing the education is significantly determinated by particular stages of the lifecycle and related phases of educational process (school education, adult education, senior education). In the first component, the substantial role is played by state and its educational policy. Scholastic education is the significant platform for the lifetime education. Thus, state is the main sponsor of the school education and state then bears the main part of its financing costs. Overall reduction of the state sector then substantially reduces the number of experts for the state administration requirements and thus also the state costs spent on the preparation of such experts decrease gradually. With coming of the information society and technology development, the more meaningful role in education process is played by the companies. But the paradox is that exactly the companies try to eliminate the education facilities in their activities and they order the education ""products"" from the external suppliers more often. This trend requires a radical reevaluation of the relation company-education. All the more it refers to the foreign investors. A preparation of the experts is thus mostly realized only in domestic medium enterprises. As the education is an element condition for the application at the labour market, the bigger pressure is transferred on the applicants themselves, so they would perform their professional and expert flexibility. The specific status belongs to the university educational system, where the Scholastic education is intersecting with an adult education, profession education. In that type of education, co-financing by more subjects (participants of the educational process, employers sphere, state, and other sources) seems to become the basic way of the solving of financing problem. Nowadays, the solving of the unemployment problem belongs to the major state priorities. That is why the state takes the large part of responsibility for increasing of the profession flexibility and thus also its portion in financing the education. At the same time, it can be stated that the structure of financing the lifetime education will change in this direction that the participation of the state and individual participants of the educational process will increase. The participation of the companies will gradually decrease - regarding own corporate educational activities - and will be transferred to the purchasing of the ""complete products"" of the educational institutions financed by other systems.",,"education; financial provision; life cycle; Slovakia"

In recent years, mining companies operating in developing countries have come under increased pressure as opponents have placed them under greater public scrutiny. Mining companies have responded by developing global corporate social responsibility strategies as part of their larger global business strategies. In these strategies, a prominent place is given to their relationship with local communities. For business ethics, one basic issue is whether such an approach to corporate responsibility is likely to effectively address the development concerns of local communities in developing countries. This paper addresses this question by investigating how the corporate social responsibility agenda of a major minor company has been implemented by one of its subsidiaries in South Africa.","Corporate social responsibility; Mining ethics; Rio Tinto",

It discusses the morality of altruistic CSR philanthropic CSR activities that are not necessarily beneficial to the firm's financial position. Evaluating altruistic CSR from all major ethical perspectives utilitarianism, rights, justice and care leads to the conclusion that, for publicly held corporations, such activity is immoral. This is because altruistic CSR violates shareholder property rights, unjustly seizing stockholder wealth, and it bestows benefits for the general welfare at the expense of those for whom the firm should care in close relationships. The paper also determines that what are often considered mandatory ethical and social corporate duties are actually optional activities that should only be undertaken when it appears that they can enhance the value of the firm, i.e. when they are used as strategic CSR. However, using ideas taken from secular and Judaeo-Christian authors on the meaning of work, the article also concludes that altruistic activities are appropriate and commendable for private firms and individuals. It offers suggestions for practitioners of CSR and for future academic research.","Corporate governance; Corporate strategy; Ethics; Social responsibility",

Until recently, the role of environmental and social management was one of damage control and helping companies reverse the unintended effects of business decisions and actions. Now corporations are actually designating individuals with in-house responsibility for social and community outreach programs. In addition, companies are taking the step of publishing social and environmental reports for public consumption. The contributions of social and environmental performance to the soft side of company value are generally accepted, but the link between this effort and financial performance has been a difficult thing to sell. Through integrated approaches to the environmental and social challenges we face, corporations and civil society are learning to better understand and value both the risks and opportunities these challenges present. The challenge of the triple bottom line is real: How can a company ensure economic growth, and deliver on the dual goals of social progress and environmental improvement? In this paper we will examine environmental social responsibility and how companies are addressing this challenge both internally and externally. We will review real-life examples that have worked, and also those that failed and why. In addition, we will discuss the issues of value and financial performance in the context of the worth of proactive corporate environmental responsibility.

In response, many companies have sought to make their giving more strategic, but what passes for strategic philanthropy is almost never truly strategic, and often isn't particularly effective as philanthropy. Increasingly, philanthropy is used as a form of public relations or advertising, promoting a company's image through high-profile sponsorships. But there is a more truly strategic way to think about philanthropy. Corporations can use their charitable efforts to improve their competitive context--the quality of the business environment in the locations where they operate. Using philanthropy to enhance competitive context aligns social and economic goals and improves a company's long-term business prospects. Addressing context enables a company to not only give money but also leverage its capabilities and relationships in support of charitable causes. The produces social benefits far exceeding those provided by individual donors, foundations, or even governments. Taking this new direction requires fundamental changes in the way companies approach their contribution programs. For example, philanthropic investments can improve education and local quality of life in ways that will benefit the company. Such investments can also improve the company's competitiveness by contributing to expanding the local market and helping to reduce corruption in the local business environment. Adopting a context-focused approach goes against the grain of current philanthropic practice, and it requires a far more disciplined approach than is prevalent today. But it can make a company's philanthropic activities far more effective.",,"article; commercial phenomena; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; economics; ethics; gift giving; human; organization; organization and management; public relations; social behavior; social welfare; United States; Charities; Commerce; Community-Institutional Relations; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Economic Competition; Gift Giving; Humans; Organizational Innovation; Organizational Objectives; Planning Techniques; Social Responsibility; United States"

A study of the web pages for 40 property and casualty firms drawn from Franzis (2000), shows that financial disclosure for the overall sample is at best moderate. The disclosure of social responsibility information on these web pages is quite low, on average.

While the language of stakeholder theory has been taken up in industries like mining, controversy remains. Disagreements arise not only about the apportionment of costs and benefits among stake-holders, but about who counts as a stakeholder and about how ""costs"" and ""benefits"" are to be conceived. This paper investigates these questions empirically by examining how managers in one mining company talk about corporate responsibilities and by analysing the explicit and implicit values systems and moral logics which inform this talk. The investigations discovered that while some claims by stakeholder groups were readily accommodated by managers, others were not. Analysis of the value frameworks employed by the mangers confirms the views of leading stakeholder theorists that stakeholder theory is grounded in the realities of management practice and behaviour.","Corporate social responsibility; Mining ethics; Stakeholder theory",

The findings of an analysis of charitable donations data from the entire U.K. FTSE index for the years 1985-2000 are then reported. These findings include the observation of a time-related increase in charitable donations, which is compared with an earlier study to give a 24 year history of charitable donations in the U.K. The findings note little responsiveness of the monetary value of charitable donations to the economic performance of firms. An international comparison over time against U.S. trends is also reported and shows how U.S. corporations have traditionally been more generous than U.K. firms, but that the trend in the U.S. is downwards. Membership of a U.K.-based ""tithing"" club (the PerCent Club) is shown to be associated with higher profit performance against non-members. Members' charitable contributions against profit are shown to be higher than the FTSE mean although short of the 0.5% target figure in ""cash"" terms. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of these findings in relation to the theoretical positions advanced for corporate philanthropy.","Corporate-community-involvement; Corporate-philanthropy; Corporate-social-responsibility; Corporate-social-versus-financial-performance; PerCent-club",

Normally companies, in a general way, do not accept the use of sustainable-development indicators and concepts for management of their activities, products and services. Indicators are used to measure or compare actual conditions with reference conditions. Indicators can be descriptive and normative. Set up in 1997, the Brazilian Entrepreneurial Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS), which is linked to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and has around 62 associate member companies, has been introducing and disseminating practices and concepts such as eco-efficiency, designed to improve the sustainability of companies. A key member of CEBDS, Petrobras - the Brazilian state-owned oil company, supports its activities and works together with it in some projects. Some international oil companies are using sustainability indicators in projects or activities in determined areas or countries, but this is not a systematic approach. Examples of potential contribution areas for sustainability indicators are the efficient use of energy and natural resources and reduction of emissions (in the environmental area), maximisation of social benefits of business and involvement of interested parties (in the social area), and maximisation of economic benefits of business and inclusion of social criteria in the business decision-making process (in the economic area). In the last few years, Petrobras has been using practices which can be related to the concept of sustainable development, such as financing environmental conservation projects in areas directly or indirectly related to its operations, developing environmental education programs, and publishing corporate reports on social responsibility. The purpose of this paper is to propose a well balanced set of indicators for sustainability - segregated by areas environmental, social and economic or integrated - that can be used either by the Brazilian or the international oil industry.",,"Eco-efficiency; Gross National Product (GNP); Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Health care; Investments; Personnel; Professional aspects; Renewable energy resources; Research and development management; Safety factor; Sustainable development; Taxation; Petroleum industry"

Having said that, this article aims to show that this theory does not offer a normative corporate responsibility concept that can be our response to two basic questions. On the one hand, for what is the company morally responsible and, on the other hand, why is the corporation morally responsible in terms of conventional and post-conventional perspectives? The reason why the stakeholder approach does not offer such a definition, as we shall see, is because the normative stakeholder approaches tend to confuse the social validity with the moral validity or legitimacy. It leads us to a conventional definition of corporate moral responsibility (CMR) that is not relevant to the pluralistic and global framework of our societies and economies.

This case study describes the transformation of the Androscoggin Mill from an object of public opprobrium and conflict to a showcase for environmental management. In the late 1980s, an 18-month strike had embittered workers and townspeople and left the mill's reputation in tatters. In response to mill environmental violations, some of which were considered crimes by state regulators, the town of Jay passed its own environmental ordinance to control mill emissions. Early in the 1990s, new management, including two former corporate-level employees, sought to change the mill's business approach and turn the Androscoggin Mill into IP's best environmental performer. The initial emphasis on establishing and maintaining compliance was expanded to include aggressive pollution prevention efforts that led to cooperative projects with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and stakeholder groups. The mill's approach in the 1990s evolved further to essentially follow principles of industrial ecology. New approaches focused on ""closing the loop"" by finding beneficial uses for previously landfilled wastes, replacements for most hazardous chemicals, and reductions in solid and hazardous waste generation. The mill also pursued the establishment of symbiotic relationships with a facility that began using a mill by-product on-site and an on-site natural gas burning facility that provided part of the mill's steam demand. IP also established a public advisory committee in 1992 to advise management on operational and ""big-picture"" issues, which later included the application of sustainability criteria to the mill. IP has since formed community advisory committees at each of their integrated pulp and paper mills.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Kraft pulping; Pollution prevention (P2); Public participation; Pulp and paper industry; Toxics use reduction (TUR)",

Technology has been used by organizations from the beginning of the ""information age"" to increase revenues and reduce costs. This paper suggests that the application of technology is also a necessary and integral component in the link between the abstraction of social responsiveness and its practical reality. This link is exemplified by the growth and success of Socially Responsible Investment Organizations (SRIOs). These firms not only use technological tools to identify, research and classify companies' suitability, but also to communicate demands from investors and concerns to corporate management. Additionally, corporate managers are able to use technology in developing mechanisms for reporting, measuring, monitoring, and disseminating vital information to various stakeholders.

This new access has inevitably brought mining companies into conflict with local communities. With the involvement of transnational advocacy networks and new global publics, these conflicts have prompted a growing transnational debate on the principles that ought to govern mining and community relationships. One effort to provide guidance on this question comes from the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement. This paper examines the regulatory impact of this policy upon relationships between mining companies and communities, as well as its ""legitimation effect"" in providing standards which, once met, can serve to certify a degree of responsible behaviour on the part of the company. The analysis of the effects of the directive is taken up in the form a case study involving a transnational mining company operating in the Andes of Peru and the local communities impacted by its land acquisition project.","Corporate social responsibility; Displacement; Involuntary resettlement; Mining ethics; World Bank",

This emphasis has, however, combined with a greater attention to environmental issues. Many private sector representatives have expressed their commitment to the principle of environmental and social responsibility, which, at the turn of the millennium, is supposed to moderate the unrelenting corporate search for profits. The analysis of the oil development in the Ecuadorean Amazon suggests though that this commitment is uneven and, overall, rather weak. More meaningful government and community participation are needed to make it effective. Without improved government regulations and increased community pressures, the corporate principle of environmental and social responsibility is likely to remain in the realm of public relations, legitimizing corporate presence in environmentally fragile indigenous territories, but producing few tangible results. In addition, more thought should be given to the nature of indigenous claims with regard to oil development. While environmental protection is an important issue, even more so is the need for sustainable income-generation projects that would allow indigenous peoples to alleviate their subsistence crisis.",,"environmental protection; indigenous population; mining; oil industry; social policy; Ecuador"

The result has been the elimination of boundaries, more flexible organizations, and a greater interaction among individuals and organizations. On the negative side, the specialization of firms on single areas of competence has resulted in the disaggregation of the value chain and in the disaggregation of ethical and legal responsibility. To illustrate this point, the paper considers some cases, such as the case of the ""beer girls"" of Southeast Asia, who are used unethically by distributors to sell beer and liquor. To deal with the problem of the disaggregation of ethical responsibility, managers can use organizational culture and ethical values to control the performance of employees and of other organizations. Contemporary developments in business ethics also offer tools for dealing with the problem. For example, ""global corporate citizenship,"" integrated social contracting theory, and stakeholder learning dialogues provide ways of integrating the interests of all stakeholders. The task is now to use these new approaches to create a governance process that incorporates the voices of all stakeholders, especially the voices of those stakeholders that have legitimate and urgent moral claims, but lack the power to establish those claims.","Network organizations; Social contracting; Stakeholder dialogue; Strategic alliances; Strategic management",

Early debates on freedom of the press pointed toward the idea of publicity as an extension of individuals' freedom of thought and expression. With the constitutional guarantee for a free press in parliamentary democracies, discussions of freedom of the press were largely reduced to the pursuit of freedom by the media, thus neglecting the idea of publicity as the basis of democratic citizenship. The concepts of public service media and, to a lesser extent, the model of social responsibility of the press attempted at recuperating the latter dimension of publicity, but with very limited success. The discrimination in favour of the power/ control function of the press clearly abstracted freedom of the press from the Kantian quest for the public use of reason. In democratic societies where the people rather then different estates legitimise all the powers, the control dimension of publicity embodied in the corporate freedom of the press should be effectively supplemented by actions toward equalising private citizens in the public use of reason.",,

To this effect, and by way of introduction, the basic economics of corporate control and of the distribution of wealth between inside and outside investors, between controlling majorities and minority holders, and the respective roles and responsibilities of these groups are first explained, and then contrasted with the position held by traditional and by new French law. A more detailed analysis is then given on the basis of a subdivision into two main parts of the article, the first dealing with the relationship between controlling shareholders and the management, while, in the second part, the participation of, on the one hand, minority shareholders, and, on the other, of the employees in the distribution of wealth is discussed. As regards the relationship between controlling shareholders or a group of controlling shareholders and the management, the article first presents the concepts of private appropriation of benefits and of the rent due to corporate control, its basis, its economic rationale and limits, before discussing its recognition as an economic reality by the law. A second sub-part of this section is devoted to appropriation of corporate wealth by the management, in particular to the grant of stock-options as an illustration of how to balance rent appropriation and management incentives. Specific attention is then given to how the NRE-Act seeks to assure such a balance by way of, on the one hand, delegating the matter to party autonomy and contractual negotiation, and, on the other, controlling the exercise of this freedom by providing for transparency under corporate law, and for limits of wealth attribution under tax law. In the second main part of the article attribution of wealth to minority shareholders is contrasted with wealth participation by employees. While both groups, however different, take an increasing share of corporate wealth - in the case of minority shareholders even of the rent due to control-, their title to such participation is based on quite different economic and legal principles. In the case of minority stockholders French courts tend to justify increased participation in corporate wealth on the basis of considerations of equity. By contrast, wealth participation by employees through acquisition of stock at preferred prices is both a matter of a corporate incentive policy, and of a State's social policy. In France, in particular, the legislator seeks to promote both objectives inter alia by means of tax law, which, therefore, is explained in some detail.",,

A response to recent financial scandals, the law tightened federal controls over the accounting industry and imposed tough new criminal penalties for fraud. The president proclaimed, ""The era of low standards and false profits is over."" If only it were that easy. The authors don't think corruption is the main cause of bad audits. Rather, they claim, the problem is unconscious bias. Without knowing it, we all tend to discount facts that contradict the conclusions we want to reach, and we uncritically embrace evidence that supports our positions. Accountants might seem immune to such distortions because they work with seemingly hard numbers and clear-cut standards. But the corporate-auditing arena is particularly fertile ground for self-serving biases. Because of the often subjective nature of accounting and the close relationships between accounting firms and their corporate clients, even the most honest and meticulous of auditors can unintentionally massage the numbers in ways that mask a company's true financial status, thereby misleading investors, regulators, and even management. Solving this problem will require far more aggressive action than the U.S. government has taken thus far. What's needed are practices and regulations that recognize the existence of bias and moderate its effects. True auditor independence will entail fundamental changes to the way the accounting industry operates, including full divestiture of consulting and tax services, rotation of auditing firms, and fixed-term contracts that prohibit client companies from firing their auditors. Less tangibly, auditors must come to appreciate the profound impact of self-serving biases on their judgment.",,"accounting; article; commercial phenomena; decision making; economics; forgery; legal aspect; social behavior; social psychology; standard; United States; Accounting; Commerce; Financial Audit; Fraud; Judgment; Prejudice; Social Responsibility; United States"

As companies declare their support for ethical practice in production and trade, a number of global union federations have seized the opportunity to sign International Framework Agreements with trans-national companies. These agreements secure commitments on the part of TNCs to respect workers' rights. The agreement between the French-owned global hotel chain Accor and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) is explored in this paper. The Accor - IUF agreement has proved critical in supporting union organizing efforts in the USA, Canada and Indonesia. It has also allowed the IUF close involvement in trade union organization in Australia, in educational activities in Africa and Asia-Pacific, and in efforts to start organizing work in the UK and New Zealand. By integrating the international agreement into the operation of the European Works Council, the IUF has also found a means to overcome the geographical parochialism of many such bodies. This paper argues that such international agreements are an excellent way to defend and advance workers' rights in the global economy while also allowing trade unions to develop a sophisticated multi-scalar response to the challenges of globalization.","Corporate responsibility; Globalization; International framework agreements; Labour internationalism; Trade union rights; Trans-national corporations",

In order for industries to properly take this responsibility in contributing to citizens' right to know, it is essential for them to grasp stakeholders' needs on corporate environmental information by promoting environmental communication. A study by the Ministry of Environment entitled 'Research on Industries' Environmentally Benign Activities' shows that companies have become increasingly aware of the importance of environmental communication in recent years. In future, for companies to promote environmental communication in an even more efficient and effective way, there are several points that need to be borne in mind. These are to: 1) define the stakeholders and aim of information provision, and choose the content and tools accordingly, 2) ensure comparability, credibility, objectivity and transparency of information, 3) add some originality to information provided as well as include negative information and 4) draw a future vision of the social role or responsibility that the company wishes to take and of the relationships that it wishes to develop with society.",,"Industrial economics; Information science; Natural resources; Environmental communication; Environmental engineering"

Caring is described as a morality of responsibility and relationship, a sensitivity to the needs of persons. The study was based on the prediction that the attachment and caring shown elsewhere to be characteristic of the morality of females would be characteristic of all managers, regardless of sex or race in this kind of corporate environment. 121 male and female, African-American and Euro-American managers responded to a survey using three subscales of a Caring Morality Inventory: caring orientation, use of intuition and feeling to make a judgment, and concern with others in decision-making. Analysis showed female managers, regardless of race, scored significantly higher on the Caring Morality scale than the male managers, supporting other findings of sex differences in caring moral perspective and suggesting that working for a company actively promoting diversity and equal opportunity does not cancel out these differences. In addition, for this study it was assumed that, although African Americans, in general, may have been sensitized to lean more toward a caring morality, any racial differences in caring morality would be cancelled out by the fact that all of the managers work for the same prodiversity and, by assumption, more sensitive company. The Euro-American managers, regardless of sex, actually scored higher on the Caring Morality scale than did the African-American managers, with the difference being attributable solely to the greater tendency of the Euro-American managers to use intuition and feeling to make a judgment.",,"adult; article; attitude; comparative study; cultural anthropology; decision making; ethnic group; female; human; male; morality; organization; questionnaire; sex difference; social environment; Adult; Attitude; Choice Behavior; Cultural Diversity; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Male; Morals; Organizational Culture; Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Social Environment"

During the preparations for the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the WBCSD has restated its vision of the relationships between responsible companies and the goal of sustainable human progress. The vision attempts to provoke a thoughtful and positive debate both inside and outside the business community. To begin with, sustainable development is best achieved through open, competitive, and rightly framed international markets. Moreover, business must be committed to working with employees, their families, and the local community and society at large to improve the quality of life. Part of this will involve increased stakeholder dialogues on the part of business. It will also involve business accepting responsibility for informing consumers about the social and environmental effects of their choices. Finally, it must be acknowledged that poverty is one of the single largest barriers to sustainability. The business case for poverty reduction is straightforward: business cannot succeed in societies that fail. Smart companies, applying sound business thinking, are already beginning to see the benefits of pursuing poverty reduction. The potential for market expansion indicates that the best is yet to come, and that the market can be made to work for all. © 2002 World Business Council for Sustainble Development.

We test these hypotheses with 1994 data on 4,705 of the nation's short-term general hospitals using two measures of hospital efficiency and four measures of social responsibility. Results confirm that for-profit hospitals and hospitals lacking local ties are managing stakeholder relationships in ways that increases the efficiency of these hospitals but decreases their social responsiveness.

A short review of the literature on joint planning and joint commissioning revealed that such partnership has proved problematic, and that the role of non-executive directors and councillors is usually overlooked. Furthermore, the research on corporate boards suggests that their performance does not match the prescriptions made for them. Following a description of the methodology of the study, the present paper reports the findings of the activity of the Joint Commissioning Board from three data sources: (1) observation of meetings; (2) analysis of documentation; and (3) participant interviews. All three sources support the view, put forward in the Discussion section, that the Board does not play a proactive role in the setting and monitoring of policy and priorities. Nonetheless, it is argued, the Board plays a central and constructive role in the governance of partnership: as the symbol of interagency partnership; as the vehicle for sustaining commitment to mental health; and as the method of bringing additional elements of public accountability to the commissioning and providing of health and social care. Locating this ritual function of the Board within the broader sociological literature, the Discussion section goes on to suggest the implications both for the future of governance of partnership and for further research in this area.","Governance; Health and social care; Partnership","article; board of trustees; cooperation; financial management; health care planning; health services research; human; interview; mental health service; national health service; organization and management; public relations; rural health care; social behavior; social work; United Kingdom; Community Mental Health Services; Contract Services; Cooperative Behavior; Governing Board; Great Britain; Health Planning Councils; Health Services Research; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Interviews; Rural Health Services; Social Responsibility; Social Work, Psychiatric; State Medicine"

This article explores the effectiveness of corporate codes of conduct, focusing on the issue of child labour. This issue is all the more pronounced, because a strict approach, involving firing child workers or terminating relationships with suppliers that employ them, does not change underlying causes. Effectiveness is explored by a close examination of the nature of child labour codes of six pioneering international garment companies, and by a survey among a focus group of opinion leaders in companies and stake-holders, who were asked for their views on the different dilemmas surrounding codes and child labour. Overall, our research shows that corporate codes are considered to be important, though not the only instruments for addressing child labour. Possible negative side effects and limitations of codes are not seen as crucial factors that harm their effectiveness. Codes must be specific, strictly implemented and monitored, and combined with alternative arrangements for under-age child workers. The importance of a supply-chain approach and attention for the host-country context is recognized. But this also raises many difficult dilemmas concerning the boundaries of corporate social responsibility, which the article examines in more detail. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The findings of the survey suggest that disclosure on sustainability issues by South African companies continues to improve, although on average, only 57% of the top companies are reporting on these issues. In annual financial reports, the issues most reported on are corporate governance, codes of conduct/ethics, employment equity and education and training, while black economic empowerment, fraud prevention and HIV/AIDS are the least reported. However, social, environmental, safety and health matters tend to be reported in more detail in the annual reports.

This concern has spawned a range of responses from voluntary action by companies, to the introduction of binding regulations at the national level. Business is a key focus of most national climate policy and voluntary efforts, both as the main source of greenhouse gas emissions as well as a major provider of solutions. Conducting an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions is an important first step a company can take towards developing an effective response to climate change. A greenhouse gas inventory provides valuable information on the risks and opportunities of operating in a carbon constrained economy. At a strategic level, greenhouse gas emissions may be relevant to a company's ""license to operate"", competitive environment, ""carbon risk"", and issues of corporate social responsibility. At an operational level, greenhouse gas emissions information may be relevant to decisions on what products to make, what materials and technologies to use, and from where to source energy. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a broad collaboration of businesses, NGO's, governments and others, was convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and World Resources Institute (WRI).

Following Reiter (1998), the paper provides detailed evidence and an illustration of how positive accounting theroists' attempts to colonize social and environmental accounting research have proved a failure. The paper carefully traces through the original work of Watts and Zimmerman (1978) showing their concern with the lobbying behaviour of large US oil companies during the 1970s. Such companies were argued to be abusing monopolists and likely targets of self-interested politicians pursuing wealth transfers in the form of taxes, regulations and other ""political costs"". Watts and Zimmerman's reference to ""social responsibility"" is shown to be a passing remark, and most likely refers to ""advocacy advertising"", a widespread practice amongst large US oil companies at that time. Subsequent literature that relies on Watts and Zimmerman to present a case for social disclosures is shown to extend their original arguments. In the process, concern over the ""high profits"" of companies is shown to diminish, and the notion of political costs is so broadened that it blurs with other social theories of disclosure. Consequently, the positive-accounting-based social disclosures literature fails to provide distinct arguments for self-interested managers' wealth maximizing. This paper also shows that the empirical evidence gathered to date in support of a positive accounting theory of social disclosures largely fails in its endeavour. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The second section interrogates the relationship between corporate accountability and citizenship, exploring the way in which early emphasis on the social responsibilities of firms has been eclipsed by claims about their entitlements as citizens. The third section looks at the extent to which notions of corporate citizenship can be meaningfully applied to relations between mobile capital and poor communities. It is suggested that depoliticised notions of citizenship as partnership serve to obscure the power inequities that characterise such relationships.

Pressures for expanding the emphasis on profits to managing responsibly derive from three general sources: primary stakeholders such as owners, employees, customers, and suppliers; secondary stakeholders such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), activists, communities, and governments; and general societal trends and institutional forces. The latter include a proliferation of ""best of"" rankings, the steady emergence and development of global principles and standards that are raising public expectations about corporate responsibility, and new reporting initiatives emphasizing the socalled triple bottom lines of economic, social and environmental performance. To respond to these pressures, many multinational corporations (MNCs) in particular are developing what we have called total responsibility management (TRM) systems approaches for managing their responsibilities to stakeholders and the natural environment. In this article we outline the dominant pressures pushing the evolution of total responsibility management and present a managerial framework that highlights the three main components of TRM approaches - inspiration (vision), integration, and improvement/innovation - with the indicators inherent to a responsibility measurement approach.",,

Furthermore, the looming crisis facing many continental European social security systems has raised many doubts about the long-term viability of the German model compared to its Anglo-American rivals. In this context, large German corporations have sought ways of sustaining their global competitiveness by, in part, restructuring their national and regional commitments. To illustrate, in this paper we concentrate on the nature and organization of German employer-sponsored pension institutions in relation to Anglo-American management practice. Two issues drive the analysis. One has to do with an emerging coalition between corporate management and shareholders with respect to the market value of the firm. The second issue has to do with the allocation of risk and uncertainty between the social partners when negotiating the financing and final value of promised retirement income. The institutional framework of collective decision-making common to many of Germany's largest firms is under pressure; three models of investment decision making relevant to pension assets and liabilities are used to illustrate this point. In doing so, we suggest that the German model is more fragile than commonly realized. We also suggest that Anglo-American management practices have penetrated and affected German corporate (national and regional) institutions and regulations. The social market lauded by advocates of stakeholder capitalism is changing rapidly, at least in the sphere of large firms and global finance.","Germany; Globalization; Pensions; Social model","financial market; globalization; market conditions; pension system; Germany"

Virchow said: 'Medicine is politics and social medicine is politics writ large!' What does this mean in relation to effective public health medicine practice and how is it likely to affect its future? There is increasingly limited freedom of expression within the current context of political correctness, central control and a rapidly burgeoning litigious climate. The purpose of this paper is to explore these issues and to propose a means of maintaining public health medicine integrity within a working environment where action is becoming rapidly constrained by political rigidity. An additional factor to be included in the dialogue is the current context within which public health physicians work. Because the majority of public health doctors are employed within the National Health Service (NHS), they are finding themselves being expected to take on tasks and responsibilities marginal to their essential purpose and function. For example, public health physicians spend a great deal of time involved in detailed deliberations about health service provision. Although there is a great deal of evidence to show that good quality health care provision positively affects the health of the individual, there is no evidence to show that this activity has any effect on the population's health status. The essence of public health medicine practice is the prevention of ill-health and the promotion of the health of the population and, consequently, attention needs to be focused on the root causes of disease. However, as these are outside the aegis of the NHS, public health medicine involvement in such issues as education, nutrition, housing, transport and poverty is regarded as marginal to the NHS corporate agenda.","Political acumen; Public health medicine; Selection training","medical education; medical practice; medicine; national health service; physician; politics; priority journal; public health; review; social medicine; Education, Medical; Great Britain; Health Promotion; Job Description; Organizational Innovation; Organizational Objectives; Personnel Selection; Physician's Role; Politics; Public Health Practice; State Medicine"

If they invite government oversight, they may be hampered by costly regulations. And if they adopt wage scales and working conditions that prevail in the wealthiest democracies, they may drive jobs to countries with less stringent standards. Such dilemmas call for clear, hard thinking. To aid in that undertaking, Roger Martin introduces the virtue matrix--a tool to help executives analyze corporate responsibility by viewing it as a product or service. The author uses real-life examples to explore the forms and degrees of corporate virtue. He cites Aaron Feuerstein, CEO of Malden Mills, a textile company whose plant was destroyed by fire in 1995. Rather than move operations to a lower-wage region, Feuerstein continued to pay his idled workforce and rebuilt the plant. Unlike the typical CEO of a publicly held corporation, who is accountable to hundreds or thousands of shareholders, Feuerstein was free to act so generously because he had only a few family members to answer to. But as Martin points out, corporations don't operate in a universe composed solely of shareholders. They can be subject to pressure from citizens, employees, and political authorities. The virtue matrix provides a way to assess these forces and how they interact. Martin uses it to examine why the public clamor for more responsible corporate conduct never seems to abate. Another issue the author confronts is anxiety over globalization. Finally, Martin applies the virtue matrix to two crucial questions: What are the barriers to increasing the supply of corporate virtue? And what can companies do to remove those barriers?",,"article; commercial phenomena; human; institutional ethics; organization; organization and management; public relations; social behavior; United States; Commerce; Community-Institutional Relations; Ethics, Institutional; Humans; Organizational Culture; Organizational Objectives; Social Responsibility; United States"

However, research combining both subjects is rare. The present study aims to fill in this gap because corporate governance is assumed to influence startups' performance. Since peculiarities of start-up companies exclude a simple application of extant governance wisdom, we develop propositions about corporate governance structures of start-up companies in Germany - a country which has the most active start-up scene in Europe but is also known for its far-reaching regulations of company law. This regulatory impact is most significantly associated with the choice of a legal form of business organization. While a certain legal form can provide some important advantages, it can require at the same time corporate governance structures which could impose problems on managing high-tech start-ups. Focussing the increasingly prevalent stock corporation, we argue that this form, on the one hand, is advantageous for gaining resources and for the comprehensiveness of strategic decision making. On the other hand, regulations as the obligations to have collective responsibilities in the management board and to set up a supervisory board can be expected to decelerate decision making and thus to put firms at a disadvantage in high paced industries. We suggest that start-ups, therefore, make hidden modifications in order to design effective corporate governance configurations. The implementation of these modifications is facilitated by social relationships. First empirical insights into the governance modalities of German start-ups are offered for illuminating our proposals. Thus, our study contributes to understand how start-ups try to reconcile the governance demands of both their business and their legal environment. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Legal form; Management board; Start-up companies; Stock corporation; Supervisory board",

Environmental effects from products often appear as externalities, outside the legal boundary of the producing company. These companies often possess the best competence to optimise the total life cycle environmental performance of its products. They are, however, neither obliged nor stimulated enough by policy incentives to do so from a sustainable development perspective. The policy instruments used today are mostly of a control-and-demand type, i.e. they do not create sufficient incentives to go further than hedging over set requirements. Environmental concerns and tightened environmental policy parameters have mostly been associated with the notion of additional costs and thus a restriction on economic performance. However, since the mid 1990s, several papers have called for corporate win-win situations as well as instruments giving up-stream incentives for change, but not enough abatement of environmental impacts has emerged in reality. Perhaps this is due to the lack of proper connection between economic theory on the one hand, and incentive advocating articles and instruments on the other. We propose a concept for trading of product life cycle (PLC) emission rights, based on property rights and transaction cost theories considering the problem with asymmetric information over the value chain. The initial financial impacts from such PLC instruments are shown to be significant for the system provider, since emissions - and resource use - become production costs. This provides economic incentives to take an increased responsibility for information flow as well as initiatives for product innovations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This trend is best described as a new governance model. In this new model, the government and private sector work together to make new laws (the co-operative approach), and, conversely, corporations are required to assume social responsibilities. Thus, there are two sides to this trend: public government is privatised and corporate government is publicised. The first part of this article discusses the cooperative approach, which has become popular in the environmental area. The main reason for this approach's popularity is that it is believed to avoid the pitfalls of the adversarial approach. The second part analyses the European Commission's ideas about corporate social responsibility (CSR) as set forth in a green paper on this topic. The definition and scope of CSR, the objectives and instruments proposed by the Commission, the CSR stake-holder model, and the management structure and tools required to implement CSR are discussed.

The survey utilised an adapted version of Aupperle's (1982) corporate social responsibility instrument to measure the priority given to economic, legal, ethical and discretionary principles in club machine gambling operations. The survey also assessed support for certain management practices in responsible gambling. The results indicate that the participating club managers prioritise economic, legal, ethical and discretionary principles respectively, and that these are statistically related to practices they have implemented and support in responsible gambling. The managers most favoured secondary harm minimisation practices, followed by reactive primary intervention. Less favoured were proactive primary intervention and discretionary practices. These principles and practices contrast markedly with those advocated by key stakeholder groups, as expressed in semi-structured interviews and submissions to the NSW Gaming Inquiry. Non-industry stakeholders favoured a more balanced set of principles and a more holistic set of management practices in responsible gambling. The results also provide validation of Aupperle's (1982) instrument when applied to corporate management of a single social impact and for Carroll's (1979, 1991) construct of corporate social responsibility.","Corporate social responsibility; NSW clubs problem gambling; Responsible provision of gambling",

In the conceptual model developed, organizational legitimacy is perceived as a way of examining corporate behaviour, whereby a business is visualized as operating under a mandate from society, withdrawable were the organization be seen not to be doing the things society expects of it. There is, however, an alternative political economy of accounting view, suggesting corporate behaviour might be perceived as more proactive, with company directors attempting to 'set the agenda', such as to manipulate societal opinion towards a favourable view of corporate activity. Agency theory is then utilized in an attempt to establish the connection between organizations and the various interest groups with whom they interact, whilst, finally, stakeholder analysis is resorted to as a way of establishing the relevant societal interest groups to which businesses might either be considered 'accountable', or alternatively whose views they might wish to 'manipulate' favourably regarding their (i.e. corporate) actions. The underpinning theory, as delineated, is then examined for validity via interviews with executives representing eight prominent UK companies in four business sectors. The model outlined enables the nature of perceived accountability/influence by the company to be linked to perceived/manipulated stakeholder expectations of the company, with the tentative conclusion being reached that support can be found for both organizational legitimacy and political economy of accounting perspectives, although which predominates is impossible to determine. © 2001 Academic Press.",,

Nowadays CEO's discus corporate responsible behaviour and sustainability more often. They feel the pressure of external stakeholders. They are aware of the increasing vulnerability of their corporate reputation, an increasing number of financial institutions start demanding social and environmental criteria - and it is more and more difficult to attract new talented people and at the same time, keeping existing employees satisfied. These developments make companies aware of the social dimensions of their organisation, their corporate identity, their role within society and their duty towards future generations. The business environment is beginning to accept that prosperity, profitability and shareholder value alone do not represent the value of the company. The companies' ability to grow and to improve continuously is also determined by its social competences, ethical responsibility and environmental contributions. This shift of focus leads to a reorientation of the concept of business excellence. At first, quality management focused on the quality improvement of products and services, later on the processes providing these products. Quality was renamed into business excellence when corporations oriented themselves on the quality of the organisation and the chain (or network or hub) in which it operates. With the present challenges at hand, companies are beginning to focus on the quality of society while taking care of their core businesses, an objective that transcends and includes the former quality orientations.

Extant business ethics literature available for application to international business demonstrates some variety but no comprehensive principles. While the domains of both international business and business ethics are expanding, they are also becoming increasingly divergent. At the same time, the primacy accorded to the multinational enterprise in both fields ignores the socio-cultural and political embeddedness of economic activities, and multiple agencies in international business (individuals, firms, nations, etc.). Some international business theorists have offered the view that international exchange should be the central building block for theories on inter national business. In this paper, it is argued that international exchange could be the fundamental unit of analysis for international business ethics as well. The potentially unifying features of exchange norms and ethical principles leads the author to develop some core exchange ethics principles that are tested on three recent international business practices.

The literature concerned with corporate governance in Russia frequently shows too much affection to the claim that the arrangement when control is allocated to insiders is generally sub-effecient in the long run. It is often concluded that the current pattern of control has negative impact on the progress of reforms. This paper argues in favor of a more balanced view, which takes into account the social responsibility of firms towards stakeholders and the influence the latter have over corporate performance. The question addressed is how real the insiders' threat is in privatized Russian enterprises with regard to the advancement of reforms and development of the workable corporate governance system.","Corporate governance; Insider shareholding; Ownership structure; Russia; Transition economies","corporate strategy; industrial practice; privatization; transitional economy; Russian Federation"

Those who are tempted to do so should not forget two things: first, the private sector will continue to be a major driver of economic growth in the years ahead; and second, sustainable development, which depends on growth, will not be achieved without the private sector.

An accurate portrayal of breast cancer would also include a good amount of attention to the potential environmental factors since many women with breast cancer and activists are pointing to such potential causes. Our examination of daily newspapers, newsweeklies, science periodicals, and women's magazines showed that there was little coverage of possible environmental causation. There was also scant attention paid to corporate and governmental responsibility. Articles often focused on individual responsibility for diet, age at birth of first child, and other personal behaviours. Articles also emphasised genetic causation, even though this explained only a small fraction of breast cancer incidence. These factors combine to place personal responsibility on women for preventing the disease. Despite gains in understanding possible environmental causation and much scientific dialogue about it, especially in light of the endocrine disrupter hypothesis, and despite growing social activism, the print media have not paid much attention to environmental causation of breast cancer. Because the media have significant influence over public understanding and social action, this lack of attention may hold back scientific and activist pursuit of environmental causes of breast cancer.","Breast cancer; Environmental health; Media",

How can managers be guided through the trade-offs that ultimately must be made and assess how social performance impacts on overall long-term corporate profitability? This article presents a framework that describes the drivers of corporate social performance, the actions that managers can take to affect that performance, and the consequences of those actions on both corporate social and financial performance. Illustrated with references to strategies currently employed by corporations, the authors examine the effects of sustainability strategies on various corporation stakeholders from investors to employees, consumers and the community at large. Showing how companies are increasingly interested in gaining lasting strategic advantage through examining and improving relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, the authors argue that, as external costs become increasingly assignable, forward-looking corporate leadership requires reporting and assessment of both current and potential social and environmental impacts. The framework they present allows for the more careful understanding of both the drivers of social performance and the impacts of that performance on the various corporate stakeholders, permitting better integration of that information into the day-to-day operational decisions and the institutionalization of social concerns throughout the organization.",,"Consumer products; Industry; Managers; Societies and institutions; Key performance drivers; Planning; corporate strategy; environmental management; strategic approach; sustainability"

Prior studies argue that firms increase demand for their debt and equity issues and, thus, lower their cost of capital, by providing more informative disclosures. However, empirical research has generally not been able to document significant benefits from increased disclosure. This paper proposes an alternative explanation - firms disclose because it is the socially responsible thing to do. We argue that companies have incentives to engage in stakeholder management by undertaking socially responsible activities and that providing extensive and informative disclosures is one such practice. We examine the relationship between firms' disclosures and measures of social responsibility. We use ratings provided by the Council on Economic Priorities as proxies for the degree of social responsibility adopted by the sample firms. Disclosure rankings provided by the annual Association for Investment Management and Research Corporate Information Committee Reports (AIMR Reports) are used to measure disclosure level. Our results indicate that there is a positive relationship between disclosure level and corporate social responsibility. That is, firms that engage in socially responsive activities provide more informative and/or extensive disclosures than do companies that are less focused on advancing social goals. In addition, we find that socially responsible firms are more likely to provide this increased disclosure through better investor relations practices. These results support our contention that increased disclosure is a form of socially responsible behavior.","Corporate social responsibility; Disclosure quality; Discretionary disclosures; Financial disclosures; Socially responsible; Stakeholder management",

But the heroic model of moral leadership usually doesn't work in the corporate world. Modesty and restraint are largely responsible for the achievements of the most effective moral leaders in business. The author, a specialist in business ethics, says the quiet leaders he has studied follow four basic rules in meeting ethical challenges and making decisions. The rules constitute an important resource for executives who want to encourage the development of such leaders among their middle managers. The first rule is ""Put things off till tomorrow."" The passage of time allows turbulent waters to calm and lets leaders' moral instincts emerge. ""Pick your battles"" means that quiet leaders don't waste political capital on fights they can't win; they save it for occasions when they really want to fight. ""Bend the rules, don't break them"" sounds easier than it is--bending the rules in order to resolve a complicated situation requires imagination, discipline, restraint, flexibility, and entrepreneurship. The fourth rule, ""Find a compromise,"" reflects the author's finding that quiet leaders try not to see situations as polarized tests of ethical principles. These individuals work hard to craft compromises that are ""good enough""--responsible and workable enough--to satisfy themselves, their companies, and their customers. The vast majority of difficult problems are solved through the consistent striving of people working far from the limelight. Their quiet approach to leadership doesn't inspire, thrill, or provide story lines for uplifting TV shows.

Synthesizing earlier research, environmental management orientation is defined here to include system analysis and planning, organizational responsibility, and management controls. The relationship between a proactive orientation and two sets of internal factors, specifically the personal views of plant managers and plant-specific characteristics, was tested using survey data from the furniture industry. The production outlook for the plant was critical, with a favorable outlook fostering a more proactive environmental management orientation. After controlling for plant-specific factors, personal views also were influential; an increasing emphasis on short-term economic value was related to a more reactive plant-level orientation. Thus senior corporate management can foster strong plant-level environmental management through a more balanced emphasis on economic and ethical values and continued investment in a plant's long-term viability.","Environment performance and social orientation; Manufacturing strategy; Natural environment",

We traced the relationship of the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation in Nigeria to impacts on the natural and social environments of the Niger Delta and more specifically on the Ogoni. Finally we discussed the emergence of political resistance and significant conflict between Shell and the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and concluded that, despite significant apparent changes in attitude at the group level, distrust and antipathy towards Shell remained entrenched in Ogoni. In this second paper, we explore in more detail issues raised by economic globalization for the practice of corporate social responsibility and stakeholder management, and contrast these concepts with an alternative 'rights-based' approach to sustainable development. We relate our observations to Shell's current approach and conclude that the Shell group and specifically the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation in Nigeria may require an alternative approach to sustainable development if they wish to merit the full confidence of communities in areas of the world as complex and distressed as Ogoni.

The mining sector has undergone a major expansion over the last two decades as part of a process of export-led recovery under Structural Adjustment programmes undertaken in response to the problems of debt and economic under-performance. While the environmental impact of mining has largely been addressed by new mining legislation and the requirements of financial institutions, little attention has been paid to mining's socio-economic impact. The prevalence of surface mining has led to an increased loss of land, a critical resource in many rural communities, as well as the absence of social infrastructure and employment opportunities that mining communities previously benefited from. This has generated community protests and demands for direct benefits from mining. State capacity-building is required for improved governance and for state reform. It is also required in the policy areas relevant to sustainable mining to ensure a better use of mining revenues for sustainable development. There is a further need for effective networking of policies and institutions relevant to mining as well as for guidelines on mining community development.

Among the most effective corporate intervention is Channel One News. It offers a newsworthy show but with mandatory commercial viewing. This increasing trend of corporations intervening to assist schools that need more money and/or equipment is disingenuous. In this essay, I present the background of this commercialization of education and demonstrate the violations against student autonomy and integrity. Although there may be utilitarian merits to some interventions, I argue that these infringe upon the moral value of personhood. Advertising in schools in its current practice is immoral on deontological grounds. I construct a framework for a resolution between corporations and education through a Covenant.

In essence, sustainable development recognizes the concept of intergenerational equity, and the need to integrate environmental and development concerns and decision-making, in order to ensure that development not only meets the needs of present generations, but also is fair to future generations. In a related trend, the call for TNCs to serve as stewards of sustainable development and environmental and social responsibility in the developing, world has also blossomed since UNCED, encouraged by a growing number of TNCs. In 1991, the ICC launched the Business Charter for Sustainable Development, a statement of 16 environmental principles. By 1997, it had been translated into 23 languages and supported by more than 2,500 companies. The 1990s also saw a proliferation of other voluntary codes of conduct and industry initiatives purporting to protect the environment, human rights and labour. At the same time, however, concern about the environmental and human consequences of operations by TNCs in developing countries has grown. Indeed, that controversy has become a central element of the current debate about trade and globalization. One arena where these developments have unfolded with real-world consequences is in the oil fields of Amazonia. Over the last decade a number of international oil companies have acknowledged that governments have not implemented meaningful regulation for environmental protection and community relations in the tropics and vowed to go beyond what is legally required by host countries. Although most corporate commitments are vague and inexplicit, in essence, they promise to voluntarily raise standards and implement new models of responsible operations.

Following the 1992 Los Angeles riots, a group of mostly corporate funders allocated grants so that poor youth in Chicago would have constructive alternatives to violence that summer. A separate group of community organizations sought to hold flinders accountable to claims about how this effort was an act of social responsibility on behalf of poor youth. In advocating for a more comprehensive philanthropic response to urban poverty than the funders had proposed, these community organizations strategically legitimized fuders' identity claims. That is, they validated funders' impression of themselves as good citizens on the condition that considering support for systemic poverty reform was necessary in order for funders to sustain this image. Regardless of whether strategic legitimation enlarges the amount of money corporations give away, it plays a central role in their achieving a socially responsible identity.

The findings implicate both company-specific factors, such as the CSR issues a company chooses to focus on and the quality of its products, and individual-specific factors, such as consumers' personal support for the CSR issues and their general beliefs about CSR, as key moderators of consumers' responses to CSR. The results also highlight the mediating role of consumers' perceptions of congruence between their own characters and that of the company in their reactions to its CSR initiatives. More specifically, the authors find that CSR initiatives can, under certain conditions, decrease consumers' intentions to buy a company's products.",,

First, the main features of the reform of state-owned enterprises are briefly summarized and a number of critical issues are identified. Second, the ""balanced concept of the firm"" is presented and compared with other approaches to corporate ethics in chiefly Western literature (discussions on ""corporate social responsibility"", the stakeholder approach, and social contract theories). Finally, the relevance of this ""balanced concept of the firm"" for the reform of state-owned enterprises is briefly discussed.","Balanced concept of the firm; Business ethics; China; Corporate ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Economic; Social and environmental responsibilities; Social contract theories; Stake-holder approach; State-owned enterprises",

Cannibals with Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business. New Society: Vancouver). However, most companies that currently use paper-based and even web-based communication vehicles for their corporate performance reports are not realizing the full potential value of these communications - either for themselves or for their stakeholders. This may be due in part to the fact that historically reports have not sufficiently engaged 'direct stakeholders', i.e. employees, customers, investors, suppliers and local communities. In this paper we review the recent history of environmental and social reporting and conclude that, whilst much progress has been made, significant challenges remain. Most notably these challenges includde (i) the avoidance of engagement fatigue by stakeholders and opinion formers alike and (ii) the extension of triple-bottom-line principles from corporate corporate headquarters into business unit operations. Conversely there is enormous potential for addressing these challenges and creating significant value for both corporations and their stakeholders through the development development of truly interactive (cybernetic) corporate sustainability reports and communications delivered via the internet and other channels. We explore sone of the implications of what we believe to be an inevitable transition in how these communications will be orchestrated.

Today's knowledge workers hop from start-up to start-up. And 40% of the navy's new recruits leave the service before their four-year tours of duty are up. D. Michael Abrashoff came face to face with the navy's retention problem when he took command of the USS Benfold. Before he became captain, sailors couldn't get away from the ship fast enough. Today the vessel is the pride of the Pacific fleet, and sailors from other ships are clamoring to join its crew. In this firsthand account, Abrashoff explains how he got the ship and its crew back on course by breaking bad habits--personal and professional ones--and jettisoning old attitudes. During his 21 months aboard the Benfold, Abrashoff came to realize that in today's technology-intensive U.S. Navy, the traditional command-and-control style wouldn't work. And it hadn't--the Benfold's 310 sailors had cheered derisively when Abrashoff's predecessor had left the ship. So he defied 225 years of navy tradition in his quest to engage the sailors in their work, increase their performance, and keep them around for their entire tours of duty. He retained his crew by redeeming them--showing them how to be not just better sailors but better people, too. That meant breaking them down when they were at their worst and then building them up to reach their best. It also meant personal redemption for Abrashoff; he resolved to really listen to what his sailors were saying. The result?

It shows the different approaches that are being adopted, and the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. It also highlights the consequences for developing countries of initiatives that are typically driven by the North, and how existing approaches do not lend themselves to participation by Southern stakeholders. The paper concludes by arguing the need for greater integration of social and environmental issues, and the development of approaches able to identify and reflect the ethical values of the South, particularly of the marginalised people ethical trade is intended to assist.","Corporate citizenship; Corporate responsibility; Environmental issues; Ethical trade; Poverty; Social issues","corporate strategy; environmental economics; ethics; poverty; trade-environment relations"

Following Levinas, it is argued that the ground of ethics lies in our corporeal sensibility to proximate others. Such moral sensibility, however, is readily blunted by a narcissistic preoccupation with self and securing the perception of self in the eyes of powerful others. Drawing upon a Lacanian account of the formation of the subject, and a Foucaultian account of the workings of disciplinary power, it is then argued that the governance of the corporation is effected precisely through encouraging such a narcissistic preoccupation with the self. For the most part our narcissistic concerns are bound to ethically indifferent financial interests. But in recent years they have also been harnessed to the demand for environmental, social and ethical responsibility by the corporation. It is argued, however, that the desire to be seen to be ethical - the ethics of narcissus - is the obverse of ""being responsible for."".",,

While such allegations are not historically unprecedented, the context in which they arise has changed. In particular, the increased integration of the global economy has created a perception that MNEs should take more responsibility for the social dimension of their actions, a perception that enterprises themselves have in part accepted through inter alia the issuing codes of corporate conduct. Furthermore, the rise of identity and lifestyle politics has made MNEs, as purveyors of products and services that help to define consumer lifestyles, a target of concern. These changes have significant implications for the evolution of human rights theory. In particular, they require a shift in the traditional view that corporations can only be victims of violations of human rights committed by states, towards one that extends responsibility for the commission, prevention and avoidance of such violations to MNEs themselves. On the other hand, there exist strong arguments against such an extension of human rights responsibilities. In particular, it is said that MNEs should only be responsible for the conduct of their business and should not be forced to involve themselves in such wider social issues. They are also private law entities and so should not possess the same responsibilities as states. This articles posits that such arguments in favour of extension, though strong and likely to remain influential, cannot answer the need for an extension of responsibility for human rights violations to MNEs where appropriate, on the basis that any attack on human dignity, whatever that legal nature and functions of its originator, must be liable to legal sanction. The technical legal means by which this might be done are considered. None the less, the article ends with a caution that any extension of human rights responsibilities to MNEs must not be allowed to deflect attention from the primary responsibility of states, as the most likely perpetrators of human rights violations, to avoid human rights violations on their own part and to establish a legal order in which the risk of such violations committed by private entities can be minimized, whether through effective national regulatory laws or international agreements on standards of corporate conduct.",,

There is now a burgeoning literature that examines sustainable development in the context of minerals and mining, most of which is concerned with sustainability at global and national scales. What is often challenging to ascertain, however, from these numerous perspectives on sustainable mineral extraction, minerals and metals recycling, environmental management, and social performance, is how sustainable development applies to mining companies themselves, and what steps a mine must take in order to improve the sustainability of operations. Since mining processes have the potential to impact a diverse group of environmental entities, and are of interest to a wide range of stakeholder groups, there is ample opportunity for the industry to operate more sustainably. Specifically, with improved planning, implementation of sound environmental management tools and cleaner technologies, extended social responsibility to stakeholder groups, the formation of sustainability partnerships, and improved training, a mine can improve performance in both the environmental and socioeconomic arenas, and thus contribute enormously to sustainable development at the mine level. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There are further pitfalls when applying the model to organizational moral ethos (OME). I argue that these problems can be circumvented, and I reformulate the Kohlberg model, building it into a framework for analyzing five interrelated sub-systems of organizational moral ethos. These are: approach to formal moral governance; basis of moral authority; deep implicit socialization; morality behind normative structure; and corporate outlook towards social responsibility. I present 19 propositions based on the core idea that in liberal individualist societies, postconventionally orientated OME would lead to a reduction in ethical dysfunctions such as bribery, discrimination, employee exploitation, dangerous products, and environmental damage.

Using tort causation doctrine as her starting point, Professor Matsuda demonstrates how the tort system sacrifices human bodies to maintain the smooth flow of the economic system. Time after time, tragedies occur: school systems fail, first graders shoot each other, women live in constant fear of rape. Yet each tragedy is met with the same systematic response: those without resources, those least able to correct the harm, are considered the legal cause of the harm. The economic and corporate interests that created the structure in which these tragedies occurred are absolved of legal and moral responsibility. Professor Matsuda proposes two changes to this system: First, when determining legal cause, we must expand tort liability in consideration of the ability of defendants to avoid, prevent, and redress social harm. Second, we must exchange our egocentric notion of responsibility for a communal and connected understanding of social responsibility. For instance, when I walk over a homeless man on my way to law school, I must recognize that it is not just a social failing that caused his plight; it is a personal failing on my part. Professor Matsuda argues that we exist in, and benefit from, a society that makes his position possible, and under current understandings of responsibility, even inevitable.",,

However, it has had little attention in the world of health care ethics. Health care in the United Kingdom (UK) is becoming an increasingly corporate responsibility, so the issue is increasingly relevant in the health care context, and it is worth considering whether the specific nature of health care raises special questions around corporate moral responsibility. For instance, corporate responsibility has usually been considered in the context of private corporations, and the organisations of health care in the UK are mainly state bodies. However, there is enough similarity in relevant respects between state organisations and private corporations, for the question of corporate responsibility to be equally applicable. Also, health care is characterised by professions with their own systems of ethical regulation. However, this feature does not seriously diminish the importance of the corporate responsibility issue, and the importance of the latter is enhanced by recent developments. But there is one major area of difference. Health care, as an activity with an intrinsically moral goal, differs importantly from commercial activities that are essentially amoral, in that it narrows the range of opportunities for corporate wrongdoing, and also makes such organisations more difficult to punish.",,"human; institutional ethics; morality; national health service; organization and management; review; social behavior; standard; United Kingdom; Ethics, Institutional; Great Britain; Humans; Morals; Private Sector; Privatization; Public Sector; Social Responsibility; State Medicine"

The paper examines the validity of this contention. The 1947 Act is placed in the context of the debate which began in the 1920s about the role of accounting disclosure in corporate governance. From the 1920s onwards, there were calls for reform to improve accountability to investors, as well as a tenacious opposition to any reduction in the discretionary powers of directors. The British Labour Party made wider-ranging proposals for reform but these were dropped from its agenda in the 1930s. The paper concludes that the 1947 Act was not a product of Labour's programme of social legislation. Instead, it was a victory for the proponents of shareholder interests.","Britain; Companies act; Financial reporting; Group accounts; Secret reserves",

Emerging research suggests that, while public policy might provide the framework for the internalisation of previous external environmental damage costs, it is corporate strategy that can make the difference between environmental disaster and pollution prevention, and responsible business practice is defined by its anticipative and pro-active approach to ensuring that pollution is prevented and mine closure is accompanied by clean-up and reclamation. The Summitville gold mine, an abandoned open pit and underground operation in Colorado is often described as an 'environmental disaster' and one of the most notorious example of inadequate design, poor operation and failed environmental management at a mining operation in the US, past or present. Now a Superfund site, and the subject of numerous legal suits and counter-suits, its unplanned and sudden closure and abandonment in December 1992 has had profound implications for environmental protection, the costs and benefits of remedial treatment, technology issues and the regulatory process in both the USA and globally. Of great import are the factors that influenced the development of events at Summitville, and these are discussed in two broad areas: Corporate strategy during the development and operation of the site; and, the regulatory framework within which the mine was permitted, operated and abandoned. Finally, the implications of the abandonment of Summitville mine for the wider mining industry, regulatory authorities and the policy literature in this field, are discussed.

The effect of this contract was to assign responsibility for generating wealth to business and responsibility for ensuring the equitable sharing of wealth to governments. Without question, this arrangement has resulted in substantial improvements in the quality of life in the industrialized world in the intervening period. I argue that with advance of economic globalization and the growing power and influence of multi national corporations, this division of responsibilities is not longer viable or defensible. What is needed, fifty years after the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, is a new social contract that shares responsibilities for human rights and related ethical responsibilities in a manner more in keeping with the vision captured by the post war Declaration. I conclude by suggesting some reasons for thinking that a new social contract may be emerging.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethics; Globalization; Government; Human rights; Social contract; U.N.

We found it in the attitudes of the corporation heads of publicly reporting newspaper companies. Because these are past attitudes and because the population is difficult to interview, normal opinion measurement was not practical. Instead, we looked at the texts of these executives' annual messages to shareholders to see if their content would differentiate between concern for profit and concern for social responsibility. It did. Coding of the text was done by computer to eliminate reliability concerns.

Furthermore, the models are mostly descriptive in nature and are based on the experiences of western countries. There has been little attempt to develop a model that accounts for corporate social responsibility in diverse environments with differing socio-cultural and market settings. In this paper an attempt has been made to fill this gap by developing a two-dimensional model of corporate social responsibility and empirically testing its validity in the context of two dissimilar cultures - Australia and Bangladesh. The two dimensions are the span of corporate responsibility (narrow to wider perspective) and the range of outcomes of social commitments of businesses (cost to benefit driven perspective). The test results confirm the validity of the two-dimensional model in the two environments. The Factor analysis revealed two leading dimensions. Cluster analysis pointed to two distinctive clusters of managers in both Australia and Bangladesh, one consisting of managers with a broad contemporary concept of social responsibility, and the other with a limited narrow view. The paper concludes that corporate social responsibility is two-dimensional and universal in nature and that differing cultural and market settings in which managers operate may have little impact on the ethical perceptions of corporate managers.","Business and society; Business ethics; Consumerism; Corporate environmentalism; Corporate social accounting; Corporate social responsibility; Societal marketing; Stakeholder model",

This model is misspecified because it does not control for investment in R&D, which has been shown to be an important determinant of firm performance.

The Japanese welfare state is currently at a new turning point. There has been some deliberate redesigning of the welfare system over the last decade, which has resulted in visible changes. However, despite the apparent changes, the underlying thinking about social welfare in Japan remains largely unchanged: postwar Japanese social welfare developed in tandem with economic growth. Although the recent pattern of welfare expansion in the midst of the worsening economy does appear to diverge from the pattern established since the end of World War II, it is in fact completely in keeping with the basic idea. A closer examination into factors such as the demographic ageing of the population, the increase in married women's labour market participation rate, the demand for low-wage flexible labour, and the restructuring of the economy in terms of more global competition and greater pressures for companies to cut costs, have together created conditions in which the established postwar model of family and corporate-centred welfare arrangements can no longer be effectively sustained. The outcome is an expansion in public welfare and services as the state takes on a greater role and responsibility in providing and coordinating social welfare. This shift, however, is not necessarily a sign that Japanese people have achieved greater citizenship rights as understood in some of the western welfare states; rather, it should be viewed as primarily a purposeful strategy aimed at facilitating economic growth. The current expansion in social welfare in Japan, therefore, can be seen as a state investment to help families and the corporate sector prepare and reorganize themselves for the new economic order.","Japan; Welfare changes; Welfare state","policy strategy; social policy; welfare provision; Japan"

Many MNCs are integrating their production on a continental scale and allocating specific responsibilities and tasks to their research centres on a global scale. Empirical research on the pharmaceutical industry suggests that the spatial reorganisation of the production system can be understood as a process of reterritorialisation and deterritorialisation on different scales. In this paper I outline how MNCs in the pharmaceutical industry are responding to the challenges of the changing economic environment. The ongoing restructuring and rationalisation in the Swiss pharmaceutical giant F Hoffmann - La Roche serves as an example. The recent acquisition of the German pharmaceuticals and diagnostics company Boehringer Mannheim by F Hoffmann - La Roche illustrates how such huge business transactions meet with trade unions which are completely unprepared. I also discuss the responses of trade unions in different affected locations to the ongoing spatial industrial reconfiguration. Whereas the executive committees of MNCs think, develop their strategies, and act on a global scale trade unions, social movements, and local governments are, in contrast, locally and nationally anchored. They have not been able to break out of the cage of localism and the national state with their concepts and activities. This structural inequality is one of the reasons for the loss of importance and credibility of trade unions. Therefore, labour must adopt a new approach to the spatial and social scales of its political practice.",,"labor relations; multinational enterprise; pharmaceutical industry; power relations; production system; trade union"

Fortune criteria of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Financial Soundness (FS), and Investment Value (IV) are relationally analyzed. This article reports which manufacturing industry groups display a close relation between a surrogate measure of ethics (CSR) and profits (FS/IV) and which industries do not. The main finding is that the strength of the relation between CSR (ethics) and profits varies considerably from one manufacturing industry to another. In other words, the relation is not uniform from product industry group to product industry group. CSR and profits appear to be directly related to each other, but not always at the same level.

However, linkages to the normative theories of business ethics, which can be used in resolving these quandaries in the corporate domain, have been lacking. This paper enumerates and explains the three major normative theories. The stockholder theory holds that managers should resolve ethical quandaries by taking actions which increase the long-term profits to the stockholders without violating the law or engaging in fraud or deception. The stakeholder theory claims that managers should resolve ethical quandaries by balancing stakeholder interests without violating the rights of any stakeholder. The social contract theory states that managers should increase social welfare above what it would be in the absence of the existence of corporations without violating the basic canons of justice. The application of these theories-to IS-related ethical quandaries is discussed and a specific quandary dealing with a real-world example - Blockbuster Video's reported plans to market customer lists - is explored in depth. The managerial challenges associated with the theories are then explored.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethical quandries; Ethics; Theoretical frameworks","Data reduction; Information analysis; Information technology; Laws and legislation; Project management; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Corporate social responsibility; Ethical quandries; Ethics; Theoretical frameworks; Professional aspects"

Because multinational enterprises (MNEs) will likely increase in size and global scope, regional and global regime development efforts for defining corporate social responsibility and performance norms will be needed. In light of these trends, this article focuses on a case study of an emerging, global anticorruption norm among countries of diverse cultures, interests, and values. Although, historically, a norm against the bribery of domestic public officials has been virtually universal, there was little prohibition against bribery by business of foreign public officials.

While a mixture of prudential and altruistic reasons were given for code adoption, content analysis suggested that the prime motive was corporate self-defence. The prevailing themes were bribery, conflict of interest, insider information, gambling, moon-lighting, accuracy of records and misuse of corporate assets. Wider social responsibility tended to be neglected. Companies appeared to have imposed their codes top-down, emphasising disciplinary procedures rather than ethics training, and appointing neither ethics counsellors nor ombuds-people.

The purposes of this study were to assess RNs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of nursing research activities, assess factors that support a research environment, and determine facilitating and challenging factors related to conducting regional nursing research. Methods: A 33-item survey based on the Iowa Model for Evidence-Based Practice was developed, validated, and determined to be reliable by the authors. Site coordinators organized and managed the orientation, administration, and collection of data from the 2,736 registered nurses who worked in 6 hospitals, 65 affiliated clinics, and 3 business units. Narrative notes taken by study investigators were analyzed for themes to determine challenging and facilitating factors for conducting regional research. Results: Education and job title significantly predicted knowledge and ability to perform research activities but was not related to willingness to engage in research activities. Several environmental factors were associated with knowledge of, willingness to engage in, and ability to perform research utilization activities. Challenging and facilitating factors to conducting regional research were identified. Conclusions/Implications: Our research environment is changing to value research as shown in the philosophy, conceptual framework, and bylaws for the professional nursing staff. Novice-to-expert research utilization expectations are included in the promotional model for nursing. All RN job descriptions and the annual performance tool were revised to include responsibilities related to research activities. The Iowa Model for Evidence-Based Practice was adopted as the method for creating practice validation and change. Train-the-trainer educational and experiential sessions are being designed for nurse leaders; all new RN employees complete a self-assessment tool of research utilization knowledge and the nursing division strategic goals incorporate research utilization expectations. The elements of this plan may be useful for nurse executives. Healthcare systems are restructuring throughout the world and within the United States. These changes are occurring to better meet the evolving healthcare needs of the population through cost-effective approaches. Within the United States, emerging organized healthcare systems require research related to patient care outcomes and the health systems that can best address them. In 1997, Aurora Health Care (AHC) restructured into regionally organized healthcare delivery systems to better serve the communities throughout eastern Wisconsin. Our goals are to provide quality and service for patients, greater value for healthcare payers, and strong leadership roles for physicians. Our objectives areto better integrate the care within the regions, strengthen the leadership role of physicians with other healthcare professionals, enhance our responsiveness to customer needs, and improve the cost-effectiveness of our services. During this same period, healthcare staff members from AHC created a 5-year strategic plan for nursing research based on Aurora's corporate strategic plan. Once fully implemented, the plan is expected to yield revised research-related policies; patient care and organizational interventions; ethical and practice guidelines; clinical decision support systems; educational packages and media; skilled nursing researchers; research networks and information systems; communication of research; information systems; and university research content.",,"article; health care delivery; health care organization; health care planning; health care system; nursing; professional practice; Adult; Aged; Data Collection; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Diffusion of Innovation; Education, Nursing, Continuing; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Middle Aged; Nurse Administrators; Nursing Research; Nursing Staff; Planning Techniques; Research Support; Social Responsibility; Wisconsin"

This wave began during the economic recession of the early 1990s and has continued during the subsequent years of economic growth. While the espoused purpose of this wave of downsizing is to reduce costs and increase ""competitiveness, "" empirical research raises doubts about whether these goals have actually been achieved. Downsizing may also have serious negative consequences for the employees who lose their jobs, for their families, and for the employees who survive the restructuring process. Despite these outcomes, downsizing appears to have become institutionalized among executives as a taken-forgranted way of managing organizations. The cognitive rigidity that this suggests makes it important to discuss alternatives to corporate downsizing. The Volkswagen (VW) Company is an important example of such an alternative, because of its innovative policy of preserving employment in Germany. This paper describes the genesis and implementation of that personnel policy, showing that discontinuities in the corporate environment do not always have to be dealt with by means of mass layoffs. Profits and social responsibility do not necessarily have to be competing goals, but can sometimes be jointly accomodated by using appropriate human resource management programs.",,

To date, analysts have not considered the environmental impact of corporate behavior - much less a wider view of social and economic impacts. Environmental sustainability reports, though still an emerging reporting tool, can begin to address the obligations of fiduciaries to look beyond short-term financial reports to a more complete understanding of a firm's long-term impact on worldwide issues of environmental, social and economic well-being. Environmental reports can frame the strategic planning of a company within the context of its natural supply chains, the approval of its customers, and the world in which workers play and live. Successes and failures are measured and reported to allow managers to adjust plans as necessary. The competitive instinct of corporate managers can be tapped through comparative reports to catalyze invention or imaginative programs that save environmental and corporate resources. Joan Bavaria discusses corporate transparency in terms of environmental reports, through the Global Reporting Initiative that is being organized by CERES (The Coalition of Environmentally Responsible Economies).

Mining companies must also encompass the social dimension. New policies for the mining industry are discussed in terms of recent worldwide trends and movements, e.g. globalization, economic interdependence and decentralization of governmental authority, and the rise of civil society as a political factor. These trends, together with the United Nations policies in quest of sustainable development and the consensus expressed at international conferences during the last decade, have deepened social awareness and set the stage for enhanced social responsiveness from the private sector. Socially responsible corporate policies include decentralization of decision-making to the field level, reaching out to stakeholders and shareholders, supporting governments which provide official development assistance for good governance and building broad partnerships to reduce social exposures.","Mining corporations; Partnerships; Social responsibility","industrial development; local participation; mining industry; sustainable development"

The idea that business owners should also seek to perform social tasks is regarded as completely erroneous. Historical evidence suggests that not all business leaders have been content simply to perform a commercial role in society. Numerous industrialists and entrepreneurs throughout the nineteenth century made significant contributions to their local communities. The early efforts of socially responsible business leaders are well documented. This paper aims to build on existing historical analysis of business philanthropy and social involvement by analysing developments in post-war Britain. Three main historical developments are outlined. Firstly, the early post-war years, despite the formation of the welfare state, witnessed some notable efforts to engage business in society. These were mainly inspired by church-led organisations and Christian entrepreneurs. Second, the expansion of the corporate economy throughout the 1940s and 1950s placed increasing constraints on the social aspirations of businesses. Finally, from the mid-1970s onwards there grew a more general interest in corporate responsibility. This was consolidated in the 1980s. As part of the general redefinition of state functions in this period, the role of business in addressing social problems became more prominent. Such political and policy developments, it is argued, have made a significant contribution towards enhancing the social role of business.",,"corporate strategy; historical geography; industrial history; social policy; article; business ethics; economics; education; ethnology; financial management; history; legal aspect; organization; psychological aspect; public health; public relations; social behavior; social justice; social psychology; social welfare; United Kingdom; Charities; Community-Institutional Relations; Economics; Ethics, Business; Fund Raising; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Organizational Culture; Public Health; Social Justice; Social Responsibility; Social Values; Social Welfare; United Kingdom"

The authors illustrate the lack of robustness by examining five recent studies of corporate social responsibility (CSR) that report conflicting results. They conclude that these contradictory findings arise from significant differences in research design and implementation.

This in turn will help to make socially responsible businesses more successful. Small businesses in small towns provide a good laboratory for examination of this issue. Data from telephone interviews with a stratified random sample of 1,008 small business owners and managers in 30 small Iowa communities were used to elaborate the relationship. Business success was measured by asking owners and managers their assessment of the success of their businesses. Scales were developed to measure business support for and commitment to the community from self-reports of behavior and attitudes. Findings show that controlling for community, business, and operator demographics, perceived business success is significantly associated with business operators' support for and commitment to the community.

Among these are supporting human capital development, leadership development, and entrepreneurship; nurturing healthy communities; and ensuring that costs and benefits associated with timber-dependence are distributed evenly across regions where specific companies have a sphere of influence and within specific communities where companies operate.","Company-community relations; Corporate responsibility; Entrepreneurship; Equity; Human capital; Leadership development","local participation; participatory approach; rural planning; sustainability; Canada"

A number of factors have contributed to this development: the increasing complexity of social problems that challenge the institutional capability of nonprofit organizations, cuts in public funding in many nonprofit sector segments, and the desire by companies to engage in social responsibility initiatives. To benefit from such alliances, social marketers need a better understanding of a number of issues, including the lessons learned from existing partnerships, the costs and benefits of alliances to both the for-profit companies and social marketing organizations and theories and models that can help guide practice in this area. This session will bring together leading social marketers and academics who are involved in thinking about and implementing alliances between nonprofits and companies. Peter Bell, CEO of CARE USA, will talk about CARE's experiences with a number of companies, including CARE's very successful relationship with Starbucks. David Williamson, Director of Communications at the Nature Conservancy, will talk about many of the alliances that his organization has been involved in, including Georgia Pacific, Canon and Disney. From the academic side, Alan Andreasen of Georgetown University presents a model of the drivers of alliance success. Finally, I will present a study that attempts to. uncover the heterogeneity in consumers' reactions to these alliances between companies and social cause organizations.

To correct this injustice, this article calls on the nation's political and corporate leaders, providers, and faith-based groups to join all Americans in a new national conversation on systemic health care reform. The Catholic faith tradition is one that compels both a proclamation to ministry values and a commitment to speak out against the challenges or threats to what are essential to the well-being of individuals and society. The Catholic health ministry must therefore be both a voice for the voiceless and an agent of transformation. The nation's goal should be to ""reposition"" health care from its status as an important, but ultimately optional building block to one that is essential.",,"article; Catholic Health Association; freedom; Health Care and Public Health; health care delivery; health care organization; health care policy; health insurance; human; minority group; philosophy; policy; poverty; religion; Religious Approach; resource allocation; secularism; social behavior; social justice; social psychology; social welfare; United States; Catholic Health Association; Health Care and Public Health; Religious Approach; Catholicism; Delivery of Health Care; Freedom; Health Care Rationing; Health Care Reform; Humans; Insurance, Health; Minority Groups; Philosophy; Poverty; Public Policy; Religion; Resource Allocation; Secularism; Social Justice; Social Responsibility; Social Values; Social Welfare; United States"

Nevertheless, he states that professional soldiers are still involved in politics, albeit the methods of involvement are different from those under communist rule, and suggests that the causes of this situation lie on both the civilian and the military sides. He recognizes five basic patterns that draw professional soldiers into politics: perception of soldiers or former soldiers as the best and only experts on security matters and their appointments to high political posts: close cooperation with nationalistic organizations; continuing links to newly reformed post-communist parties; unclear division of responsibilities in constitutional and legislative frameworks, and deteriorating social and living conditions. He also points to the rift between the older and younger generations of professional soldiers and the differences in their political involvements.",,

The paradigm within which these responses have been made, however, appears to be confused. This paper proposes the role that companies are best able to play in the societal progression towards sustainable development. We argue that the concept of sustainable development may only be properly applied at the global level; it follows that a 'sustainably developed' company or industry sector is not a practical objective. Nevertheless, the contribution which business can make within a sustainable development framework is recognized as being of the highest importance. We suggest that the nature of this contribution pivots around a distinction between environmental soundness (which concerns the interaction between the environment and economics) and sustainability (which adds a broad social element to the environmental and economic, and requires the consideration of time horizons). It is proposed that companies are well positioned to pursue effective environmentally sound corporate strategies. It is also argued that such strategies offer great potential to advance social justice, as environmental improvements are often disproportionately beneficial to poorer groups in society. In contrast, arguments are presented against companies attempting to move beyond environmental soundness to address those broad social elements demanded by sustainable development. A broad allocation of those responsibilities inherent in sustainable development to societal institutions is presented, placing the suggested role of business into context. In advocating the adoption of corporate strategies based on environmental soundness we do not seek to derogate the concept of sustainable development; we do aim to stem the apparent continuing erosion of its fundamental tenets and to identify responsibilities that are appropriate to business.",,"corporate strategy; environmental management; industrial performance; sustainable development"

Involving everyone from community Landcare groups to the corporate sector and government agencies, 'landcare' is seen to have become something bigger than the program that spawned it. In lieu of convincing evidence that Landcare has transformed agricultural practices in a demonstrably sustainable direction, this high level of involvement is itself cited as a measure of success. Such a view, however, pays little attention to competing conceptualization's of what 'landcare' actually means, to the power relationships between those involved, or to the multitude of other social projects in which those involved are engaged. The failure to address these issues masks the extent to which Landcare both contributes to the further intensification of farming practices, and is used as a signifier of environmental and social responsibility in the greening of the corporate images of its sponsors. By sponsoring Landcare initiatives companies gain licensed access to use of the Landcare Australia logo and may position themselves as responsible corporate citizens, irrespective of the environmental effects of their own products and manufacturing processes. A form of 'green consumerism' is thereby constituted through which consumption is directed not towards the products of farmers attempting to produce more sustainably, but towards the companies that ostensibly support their efforts to do so.",,"land management; local participation; participatory approach; rural planning; Australia"

Today several leading companies are beginning to find inspiration in an unexpected place: the social sector. That includes public schools, welfare-to-work programs, and the inner city. Indeed, a new paradigm for innovation is emerging: a partnership between private enterprise and public interest that produces profitable and sustainable change for both sides. In this article, the author shows how some companies are moving beyond corporate social responsibility to corporate social innovation. Traditionally, companies viewed the social sector as a dumping ground for their spare cash, obsolete equipment, and tired executives. But that mind-set hardly created lasting change. Now companies are viewing community needs as opportunities to develop ideas and demonstrate business technologies; find and serve new markets; and solve long-standing business problems. They focus on inventing sophisticated solutions through a hands-on approach. This is not charity; it is R & D, a strategic business investment. The author concedes that it isn't easy to make the new paradigm work. But she has found that successful private-public partnerships share six characteristics: a clear business agenda, strong partners committed to change, investment by both parties, rootedness in the user community, links to other organizations, and a commitment to sustain and replicate the results. Drawing on examples of successful companies such as IBM and Bell Atlantic, the author illustrates how this paradigm has produced innovations that have both business and community payoffs.",,"article; commercial phenomena; cooperation; economic aspect; mass communication; organization; organization and management; public relations; research; social welfare; United States; urban population; Commerce; Community-Institutional Relations; Cooperative Behavior; Diffusion of Innovation; Economic Competition; Entrepreneurship; Organizational Innovation; Research; Social Welfare; United States; Urban Population"

This change envisions an end to reliance upon the state for the provision and financing of health services and the fostering of a system of family-based welfare. In the future citizens should finance their own health care through savings, insurance or as part of their terms of employment. While the state will still accept a degree of responsibility for those unable to pay for their health care, it wishes to share this burden with the corporate sector and non-government organizations as part of a national policy of the 'Caring Society'. In this article the retreat from a commitment to a welfare model of public health care is documented and some of the serious obstacles to such a policy are discussed. It is concluded that the government's aspirations for reforming the welfare model will need to be tempered by both practical and political considerations. Moreover, the socio-economic consequences of the Asian currency crisis of 1997 are likely to increase the need for government welfare action.

In this Article, Professor Williams defends the view that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can and should require expanded social disclosure by public reporting companies to promote corporate social transparency comparable to the financial transparency that now exists. As used in this Article, ""social disclosure"" refers to disclosure of information about a reporting company's products, the countries in which a company does business, and the labor and environmental effects of a company's operations in the United States and around the world. Professor Williams shows that the SEC has the statutory authority in fashioning proxy disclosure to require disclosure either to promote the public interest or to protect investors. To construe the SEC's public interest disclosure power, she examines the intellectual derivation of the securities laws and their legislative history, demonstrating that increasing corporate accountability to shareholders and to the public was a central goal of Congress in 1933 and 1934, as was constraining the exercise of corporate power and inculcating a greater sense of public responsibility into corporate managers. Thus, she argues that it is fully consistent with the language, purpose, and legislative history of the securities laws for the SEC to use its authority to require expanded disclosure about management's policies and practices with respect to social and environmental issues. A close examination of the SEC's rejection of requiring expanded social disclosure in the 1970s buttresses this conclusion. Professor Williams concludes by making the affirmative case for expanded corporate social transparency and for the SEC's legitimate role in promoting such transparency, both from the perspective of the ""economic"" investor, who is assumed to be interested primarily in the financial returns from an investment, and from the perspective of the ""social"" investor, who is concerned more broadly with the social and environmental effects of corporate conduct.",,

Because of the strains brought on by the maturing of the Japanese economy, the negative consequences of this micro moral unity are now becoming apparent. A new paradigm will be required to address these challenges.

At the global electricity giant AES Corporation, the answer is all 40,000 of them. In this interview, chairman Roger Sant and CEO Dennis Bakke reflect on their trials and triumphs in creating an exceptional company and explain how their employee-run company works. When they founded AES in 1981, Sant and Bakke set out to create a company where people could have engaging experiences on a daily basis--a company that embodied the principles of fairness, integrity, social responsibility, and fun. Putting those principles into action has created something unique--an ecosystem of real empowerment. What does that system look like? Rather than having a traditional hierarchical chain of command, AES is organized around small teams that are responsible for operations and maintenance. Moreover, AES has eliminated functional departments; there's no corporate marketing division or human resources department. For the system to work, every person must become a well-rounded generalist--a mini-CEO. That, in turn, redefines the jobs of the people at headquarters. Instead of setting strategy and making the ""the big decisions,"" Sant and Bakke act as advisers, guardians of the principles, accountability officers, and chief encouragers. Can other companies successfully adopt the mechanics of such a system? Not unless they first adopt the shared principles that have guided AES since its inception.

Given the critical nature of information systems to an HMO's business success and regulatory compliance, the large financial investment HMOs make in their systems, and the widely publicized concerns over the year 2000 ""millennium bug"" problem, information systems are appropriately a matter of concern to an HMO's board of directors. The recent experience of Oxford Health Plans, Inc. offers a case study in the apparent failure of the directors to monitor adequately the in-house development of an information system. The systems disaster which this corporation suffered in 1997 led to a dramatic drop in stock price, from which the company has yet to recover, as well as intense scrutiny by state and federal regulators and countless shareholder derivative actions against the directors. Corporate directors are subject to the fiduciary duty of care. Despite statutes in some states requiring directors to act prudently, state courts almost always apply the standard of gross negligence. As a result, even when directors act without due deliberation in their decision, it is rare that a court will find them to have failed in their duty of care. The business and regulatory community may find otherwise, however, when directors fail to evaluate information systems options carefully and the business suffers as a result.",,"administrative personnel; article; commercial phenomena; health maintenance organization; human; information system; legal aspect; legal liability; malpractice; organization and management; social behavior; standard; United States; work; Administrative Personnel; Commerce; Health Maintenance Organizations; Humans; Information Management; Information Systems; Job Description; Liability, Legal; Malpractice; Social Responsibility; United States"

The report focuses on the activities of Canadian corporations in the developing world, where the challenges of social and environmental responsibility are apt to be most acute. In keeping with the Institute's approach, the report seeks a balanced judgment on both what Canadian firms have achieved in the past and what they may strive to achieve in the future. It does this by lauding the good corporate practices (and there are many examples) as well as identifying the bad. And it makes several recommendations to corporations, governments, and the Canadian public, aimed at enhancing the social and environmental performance standards of Canadian businesses. Striving for higher levels of social and environmental performance does come at a cost. Some might say that such efforts impair the competitiveness of Canadian businesses in the global marketplace. To be sure, there are profits to be made by adjering to the lowest possible standards for workers, the community, or the natural environment. And there may, indeed, be lost commercial opportunities in adhering to higher standards. But there are two extremely good reasons for aiming considerably higher than the lowest common denominator. The first relates to our values as Canadians. At home, we treat issues such as human rights, workplace standards, and responsible stewardship over the natural environment very seriously. The importance we attach to these values is integral to our international reputation as a fair and democratic society. It is no doubt also reflected in Canada's consistently high ranking at or near the top of the United Nations' Human Development Index. In our conduct abroad, our standards should be no less than those we strive to achieve at home. Indeed, what countries are better placed than Canada to defence these values in the global marketplace? Second, ethically and environmentally responsible conduct can actually be good for business. Canada is a trusted country, a respected country, and those attributes are of benefit to corporations doing business in its name. More to the point, however, firms striving to enhance their workplace, community, and environmental standards actually strengthen the climate for business. By contributing to the well-being of their stakeholders and the sustainability of the natural environment, firms invest in their own long-term profitability.",,"corporate strategy; ethics; human rights; Canada"

This paper proposes a new paradigm, LIFESIZING, to address the issues raised by this ethical quandary. The paper will explore the effect the creation of fictitious personhood (Corporations, Government, Wall Street, Unions, etc.) has had on the concept of personal responsibility and common good when responsible individuals are but transient members of such a legal entity. It will briefly recap the history of downsizing, the practice of treating workers as an expense rather than a capital asset, stakeholder theory, and the rise of a ""me-first"" culture.

Unprecedented access to information through consumer and citizen Net-works has created the ""transparency"" in corporate life that has overturned conventional ideas about ownership in organizations, reshaping popular images of Big Business carved by partisan politics. Corporate Social Responsibility, also called ""stakeholder capitalism,"" suggests that prosperous business owes something back to the community from which it draws its profits. The widespread use of pseudo-polls by policy advocates in public relations campaigns and the media ownership of polls have undermined public confidence in the credibility of the phrase ""what the public thinks."" While technology diminishes the ability of corporations, politicians, and governments, to control or define a public image, the individual enjoys unprecedented access to information and a newfound advantage in the sphere of public influence. The currents and undercurrents of the life cycle of public information, disbelief, persuasion and doubt pose profound questions for public relations inquiry, on an ethical as well as technical level.",,

Marketing and public relations vie for supremacy since both groups specialize in communication, using managed communications to pursue their respective objectives. Convincing arguments for one being subsumed by the other abound. A clarifying discussion of the often-confused vocabulary is the starting point for a review of the nature and role of marketing and public relations and how they are portrayed in respective textbooks. The emerging total management system of corporate communication and its relationship to marketing and public relations is placed in a framework for the integration of corporate strategy, organizational development, human resource management, public relations and marketing. Corporate communication has a dominant role in achieving organizational growth, by being concerned with learning, showing the corporation to itself and as a mode of organization for both external and internal environments. (The term corporation is consciously chosen in place of organization to connote a social collectivity. The term organization is retained for the outcome of the managerial process of organizing.) Considerable attention has been afforded in the academic literature to debating the nature of the relationship between marketing and public relations. This paper deals with their respective roles within a corporate communication function and presents and supports an argument for the integration of marketing and public relations with strategic management as part of a disciplined corporate communications management strategy. This requires moving beyond traditional domain boundaries.","Corporate communication; Integration; Marketing; Public relations; Total communication system",

To provide a common framework for understanding ethical decisions facing organizations delivering the news of dismissal to affected employees, Integrative Social Contracts Theory and the research on social exchange was used to integrate existing research on employee dismissal. Of particular importance was determining the criteria necessary to manage the dismissal process within ethical boundaries. Three basic criteria, which together represent a variety of contractual and transactional obligations, are proposed as necessary for an ethical approach to dismissal; 1) advance warning of the job loss, 2) open communication, and 3) institutionalized support services. The frequency with which organizations meet these criteria is examined using a geographically dispersed, cross-organizational sample of 770 involuntarily displaced professional employees. In addition, the effect of such an ethical approach to dismissal on individual psychological and financial outcomes is examined. Findings are discussed as they relate to the implicit contract between employee and employer and organizations' responsibility to employees during corporate restructuring.",,

Furthermore, there is a need in strategic terms to anticipate and to plan for environmental concerns and to incorporate this thinking into corporate strategy. Thus a new subfield of strategic management is beginning to emerge: that dealing with the natural environment as it affects corporate strategy. Alan Rugman and Alain Verbeke in their paper 'Corporate strategies and environmental regulations' organize the literature on environmental regulations and corporate strategy into a new managerial framework. They go on to develop a resource-based view of the interaction between the firm's key resources (core competences) and environmental regulations including the implications for the development of 'green' capabilities. Finally, they analyze the deployment of 'green' capabilities within a standard international business model and explore hypotheses on the relationships between environmental regulations, competitiveness, and corporate strategy. The question about how firms should respond to environmental regulations can be seen in broad terms as part of the debate on corporate social responsibility. A fundamental problem in this area has been that there are no definitions of corporate social responsibility or corporate social responsiveness that provide a framework or a model for consistent systematic collection, organization, and analysis of corporate data relating to these important concepts (Clarkson, 1995). © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","'Green' strategies; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental regulation; Multinational enterprises; Stakeholder theory",

It is therefore persuasive to note the role that ethical considerations play in various quality award schemes, and this furthers the argument towards an integrated approach. Having said this, there is scant evidence in the awards that ethical aspects have achieved high materiality. Business ethics has the potential to become a significant aspect of corporate strategy and culture. We now have the 5Es of audit: economy, efficiency, effectiveness, environment and ethics. The ethical audit has tended to be an activity carried out by pressure groups external to organizations. With an increasing emphasis on the wider corporate and social responsibilities of organizations, this external only approach is less than adequate. Organizations which take their stakeholders for granted and abuse their wider responsibilities, including the environment, may find that their continued viability is in doubt. A definition is provided of the 'business ethics audit' which attempts to find a middle way between a view that businesses are entirely about creating social good, and one which considers that 'the business of business is business' and that there is no wider social responsibility. The preferred approach is to internalize within companies concern for ethical matters, and the appointment of a consumer advocate with access to the board is one way to achieve that. Ethical audit is, after all, merely an extension of existing legal and regulatory requirements.

From this perspective we find that marriage is an institution by which men are provided (socially supported) rights to women. Typically, this institution is embedded within a domestic group wherein a multiplicity of other rights and responsibilities are assigned. Hence, the definition of marriage attributable to E. R. Leach confounds domestic rights (which may exist in the absence of marriage) with marital rights. Notes and Queries and Kathleen Gough define marriage by reference to the legitimacy of children. However, legitimacy is a construct oriented toward restricting access to resources on the basis of parentage. In particular, characteristics of parentage are used strategically as a basis for delimiting the set of offspring admissible into the corporate groups to which their fathers or in matrilineal systems their mothers belong. The extent to which legitimacy is tied to marriage is a strategic variable in the control of dominants within a social system.

All societies need healers, and in the English-speaking world the services of the physician-healer have been organized around the concept of the professional. The great increase in both state control and corporate involvement has seriously intruded into the traditional autonomy enjoyed by both the medical profession and individual physicians, and further changes can be expected. More physician are becoming either employees on managers in the state or corporate sector while others are being forced to compete in a marketplace that rewards entrepreneurial behavior. It is the responsible behavior of the professional that will protect the role of the healer. Medicine has been rightly criticized for placing undue emphasis on both income and power and for protecting incompetent or unethical colleagues; and it has failed to accept responsibility for injustices or inequities in health care systems, has moved slowly to address new diseases or issues. Nonetheless, all evidence indicates that society will values the healer- professional and does not, wish to abandon professionalism as a concept-it appears to prefer an independent and knowledgeable professional to deal with its problem rather than the state or a corporation. For this reason, medicine professional associations and academic institutions must ensure that all physicians understand professionalism and accept its obligations.

A knowledge activist is someone, some group or department that takes on particular responsibility for energizing and coordinating knowledge creation efforts throughout the corporation. Therefore, he acts in three roles: as a catalyst of knowledge creation, as a connector of knowledge creation initiatives and as a merchant of foresight. To catalyze social processes of knowledge creation, a knowledge activist formulates 'process triggers' and creates space or context for knowledge creation. The concepts of microcommunities of knowledge, imagined communities and shared maps of cooperation help the knowledge activist to connect knowledge creation initiatives: since there are limits to the number of participants in microcommunities, the knowledge activist establishes imagined communities, whereby shared maps of cooperation are important. As a merchant of foresight, the knowledge activist finally provides overall direction to the knowledge creation taking place in various microcommunities. The authors warn of three possible misconceptions and pitfalls of knowledge activism. First, the task of a knowledge activist is to enable, not control knowledge creation. Second, knowledge activism is not only about connecting others, but also about ensuring self-connections. Finally, lack of knowledge creation should not be covered up by establishing a knowledge activist. Knowledge activism finds different sources in different companies.

The Rule as currently written is not designed to enhance optimally corporate democracy or social responsibility given the numerous SEC exceptions to the includability of proposals. Professor Lazaroff recommends that the Rule needs to be reevaluated so that it can be easily applied, with little need to consult the SEC or the courts regarding the includability of individual proposals. After analyzing the administrative and judicial treatment of the current rule, Professor Lazaroff offers some alternatives designed to create greater clarity and simplicity while enhancing legitimate shareholder participation in the corporate decision-making process.",,

The process used to reach those decisions defines an organization's commitment to its mission, values, and corporate ethics. At Sisters of Mercy Health System in St. Louis (SMHS), a corporate decision-making process was developed over the course of a year and introduced systemwide in 1994. The process establishes a disciplined and accountable technique for evaluating initiatives, discussing options, and arriving at clear, values-based decisions. The process begins with two questions: Is the proposed action compatible with the organization's mission? Will the proposed action advance the mission in any significant manner? Next, a step-by-step approach enables members of the decision-making group to consider the proposed action in light of the SMHS mission and values. Participants explore the implications of the decision from three perspectives: social vision, responsibility, and self-interest. They also consider the potential consequences of the decision on all affected parties, particularly poor and powerless people.

Given that social responsibility projects entail costs, it is not always obvious under what precise conditions managers will have a responsibility to engage in activities primarily designed to promote societal goals. In this paper we discuss four distinct criteria for evaluating the legitimacy of corporate projects for institutionalizing social responsibility: (1) local knowledge, (2) level of responsibility, (3) shared consensus, and (4) relationship to financial performance. We conclude our discussion by noting that in those cases where the firm possesses knowledge about a specific problem and its solution, is directly responsible for causing harm, where a shared consensus among all relevant stakeholders exists, and financial performance will be enhanced, social responsibility projects are ideal. Obviously, no program will meet all of the criteria. In fact, our model specifically suggests that there is often a trade-off between the first three criteria and the last. For example, in those situations where the corporation directly imposes harm on third parties, and where a high degree of consensus exists among all stakeholders, there is little need to link the social responsibility program to financial performance. By contrast, as the corporation seeks proactive solutions to problems which are only incidental to the corporation, and where little consensus exists, the predicted relationship to financial performance becomes more crucial. By formally examining the trade-offs among these four criteria we more fully understand the complex relationship between social responsibility and financial impacts.",,

The results of three studies, including one that measures respondents' CA and CSR associations for well-know companies and one that uses consumers recruited in a shopping mall, demonstrate that (1) what consumers know about a company can influence their beliefs about and attitudes toward new products manufactured by that company, (2) CA and CSR associations may have different effects on consumer responses to products, and (3) products of compannies with negative associations are not always destined to receive negative responses.

After a 1995 survey revealed that the Indian people lack accurate information about HIV/AIDS and that condom use was low, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) began to incorporate HIV/AIDS prevention activities in its social development activities in the work place. CII's objectives are to 1) mobilize companies to implement nondiscriminatory policies towards infected employees; 2) sensitize companies on issues related to HIV/AIDS; 3) advocate shared social responsibility; 4) implement behavior change programs at the work place; and 5) provide quality clinical services including referrals, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and provision of condoms. As a result, a STD/HIV/AIDS prevention campaign was initiated in 1996 at the 500-employee Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Company. The campaign involved 1) endorsement by management; 2) a participatory approach; 3) a situation analysis based on concern for individuals; and 4) an intervention implementation design that included sensitization, group sessions, activities to enhance awareness, promotion of behavior changes, provision of services, reinforcements, expansion, and STD management.

Corporations may donate money both directly to charities and indirectly through a corporate-sponsored foundation. Tax and financial advantages, as well as differences in corporate image, arise due to policy differences in the treatment of certain gifts. This paper presents a new model of corporate giving, and examines the financial implications of both direct and corporate foundation donations. Important considerations are corporate and foundation tax rates, the occurrence of donations to non-U.S. (or other non-tax-deductible) charities, the sale of assets to fund corporate foundations, and the effects of contributions over time. Comparative statics from a two-period model provide theoretical motivations for making certain types of gifts in certain ways. The results show that tax deductibility, tax rates, amounts of gifts made overseas, and capital gains provisions for corporate and foundation use affect giving. In fact, use of a nonprofit foundation for making contributions often results in a ""subsidization"" of monies to be distributed for charitable purposes and, hence, more after-tax income for the corporation. © 1996 Temple University.","Corporate giving; Corporate social responsibility; Nonprofit organizations; Nonprofit subsidization; Nonprofit tax laws",

In the United States, education's effects on responsibility were indirect, operating through attitudes toward obedience and toward corporate accountability.

He termed this explanation the separation thesis. This article explores the possibility that the separation thesis captures a pervasively held view about corporations, even among B &S researchers.

These rhetorical strategies are decentering, deindividuation, and distanciation. Decentering is a process whereby individuals lose their sense of personal accountability as they are submerged within the corporate voice, obscuring matters of authorship, attribution, and responsibility. Deindividuation describes the process of assimilation into a corporation's symbolic reality. Distanciation is defined as the methods used to create, maintain, and alter this symbolic reality of diffused responsibility within the postmodern corporation. After examining these rhetorical strategies, it is possible to show that the postmodern corporation mediates and controls the reality of individuals; therefore, it, and not its members, should be viewed as morally accountable. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.",,

This study examined whether athletic departments are perceived to be controlled by the funding sources in their environment according to their relative resource dependence upon those sources. Financial resource dependence and perceived control data were obtained from athletic directors (ADs) at 34 Canadian universities. Significant Spearman rank order correlations reveal the resource dependence-based perceived control of the university central administration, corporate sponsors, and provincial/federal sport organizations and ministries (p < .05).

The core belief is that business managers, even in their role as managers, have responsibilities to society beyond profit maximization. Managers, in pursuing their primary goal of increasing shareholder value, have social responsibilities in addition to meeting the minimal requirements of the law. Nevertheless, the call for increased social responsibility on the part of business managers remains controversial. At least two major perspectives on social responsibility can be isolated. The classical view, most closely identified with Milton Friedman, suggests that social responsibility is incompatible with a free enterprise economy. By contrast, advocates of increased social responsibility point out the desirability for voluntary (and at times costly) corporate activities which promote society's well being. The purpose of this essay is to briefly describe both the classical and pro-social responsibility perspectives. We suggest that while important differences in assumptions characterize the two distinct views, there is enough overlap and agreement to move the debate beyond the current stalemate. Specifically, we argue that the concept of lifnim mishurat hadin, an innovative and ancient Jewish legal doctrine which is usually translated as ""beyond the letter of the law"", might serve as a model for modern legal and social thought. We examine talmudic and post-talmudic sources which apply this concept to the area of business ethics, and explore its applicability to the modern situation. Although the business ethics literature rarely refers to Talmudic and rabbinic sources, these texts reflect a sophisticated understanding of business practices and ethical problems.",,

This paper examines social responsibility programmes which create strategic benefits for firms. Five strategy dimensions are identified which help to assess the value created for the firm by CSR programmes; centrality, specificity, proactivity, voluntarism and visibility. Guidelines for managers to incorporate these dimensions into a strategic analysis of their social responsibility are presented to encourage more support for these mutually beneficial programmes.

The nurses' views were considerably at variance with the officially stated commitment to inter-disciplinary collaboration and coordination within the Community Care Programmes of Ireland's regional health boards. The PHNs feared that involvement in child care proceedings of a social control or adversarial nature would compromise them in terms of their traditional curative and preventive health roles, and, on this basis, argued that social workers should retain the bulk, if not all, of the responsibility for such child care activity. The nurses also defined their work roles in terms of their own traditional, professional commitment to individuals, families and communities, and felt less bound by or even aware of the corporate responsibility of their employing health board. It is concluded that the enactment of new legislation and allocation of additional resources do not resolve the issues of inter-disciplinary collaboration in this area.","Child protection; Child welfare; Community care; Public health nurses; Social workers","article; child care; child welfare; community care; human; ireland; law; nurse; responsibility; social control; social worker; Adolescent; Attitude of Health Personnel; Child; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Female; Focus Groups; Health Care Rationing; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Ireland; Male; Patient Care Team; Public Health Nursing; Social Work"

The purpose of this study was to examine the public interest report as a vehicle through which a firm might disclose information in the public interest. We concluded that there were at least three principal forces driving GM's disclosures.

In reading their public interest reports, it became clear that GM is socially responsive in matters of public interest. Whether they are socially responsible is a judgment not within the scope of this study.

Corporate consciousness serves as a framework for understanding the current trend within organizations toward greater awareness of societal realities, and of the organization's impact within larger systems. This framework borrows heavily from the cognitive, social, and organizational psychological literature and can be understood from both micro and macro levels of analysis. Also discussed are the issues of why and how to study corporate consciousness, as well as implications for the organizational practitioner. © 1996 Human Sciences Press, Inc.",,

The effect of a law requiring the provision of community benefit depends on the degree of competition in the local market. In competitive markets, such a rule is like a hidden tax.

Academic medical centers have responded to health care reform initiatives by launching a series of strategic plans designed to maintain patient/low and reduce hospital expenditures. Thought is also being given to processes by which the faculty can individually and collectively adjust to these changes and maintain morale at a time when reductions in the labor force and pay cuts are virtually certain. Physicians are concerned because managed care threatens their autonomy and jeopardizes the traditional ways in which they have carried out their multiple missions. Some doctors believe that it will become increasingly difficult to obtain genuine satisfaction from their job. Methods. The strategies that academic medical centers have begun to use to address the numerous challenges posed by a system of health care based on managed competition are reviewed. Potential mechanisms by which academic departments can continue to find fulfillment in an environment that threatens their traditional missions and values are discussed. Results. A study of the social and historical origins of medicine in the United States reveals that the introduction of corporate medicine in the United States was destined to happen. Strategies implemented by academic medical centers in response to managed care include building an integrated delivery network, the acquisition of primary, care practices, increasing cost-effectiveness, and creating physician-hospital organizations. Emphasis must be placed on integrating traditional core values (excellence, leadership, and innovation) with newer values such as patient focus, accountability, and diversity. A shift from rugged individualism to entrepreneurial teamwork is crucial. These reforms, although frightening at the onset, can serve to reaffirm our commitment to academic medicine and preserve our mission. Conclusions. The evolving managed care environment offers unique opportunities for academic medical centers to shape and positively impact health care delivery in the twenty-first century. In a reconfigured model that combines core values with newer values, university-based physicians can continue to reap the intangible rewards derived from patient care, research, and education.",,"article; cost effectiveness analysis; health care delivery; health care policy; health insurance; health service; medical practice; patient care; physician attitude; primary medical care; priority journal; professional practice; responsibility; university hospital; Academic Medical Centers; Forecasting; Health Care Reform; Managed Care Programs; Social Responsibility; Surgery; United States"

Increasingly, doctors are being drawn into rationing by two powerful forces. Firstly, through the corporate responsibilities of those working within a managed health care system in which organisational objectives and budgetary constraints are agreed and specified in a much more explicit way than ever before. Secondly, by the professionally-led movement towards more clinically effective practice. These, in combination, are leading towards a fundamental review of the nature and ethical basis of clinical practice in which the duty of doctors to individual patients must be balanced against the wider considerations.",,"article; attitude; clinical practice; health care financing; health care organization; health care policy; human; medical decision making; priority journal; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Ethics, Medical; Great Britain; Health Care Rationing; Health Expenditures; Health Policy; Human; Refusal to Treat; Social Responsibility"

Polly Peck International's involvement in citrus production in North Cyprus provides an exemplary case of the restructuring of production relations based on contract farming. The study shows how contract terms differ depending on farmers ' access to key resources such as water, both reflecting and accentuating social differentiation. Only large farmers are in a position to invest in water to maintain productivity, but they too act only in the short-term. Short-term corporate profits are made at the expense of long-term productivity declines for farmers. Since costs of production, such as irrigation, do not enter the contract between the grower and the transnational corporation (TNC), any environmental costs become the burden of the grower. TNCs can avoid responsibility for the over-exploitation of key resources that they encourage directly or indirectly, because environmental costs do not enter the relationship between capital and the grower.",,"citrus production; contract farming; environmental degradation; productivity decline; transnational corporation; Cyprus, (North)"

Individuals may have social responsibilities according to Friedman, but not corporations. When executives make contributions to address social problems in the name of the corporation, they are doing so with other people's (shareholders') money. The responsibility of corporate executives is a fiduciary one, to serve as an agent for the corporation's shareholders, and to uphold shareholders' trust, which requires executives to maximize the return to their shareholders, who can then, if they choose, contribute their own money to worthy causes. Of course, shareholders face the decision problems inherent in the classic ""prisoners' dilemma,"" where the choices that are collectively sensible are individually unreasonable. Given their dilemma, shareholders should not expect to be able to control executives sufficiently to make them perfect agents, dutifully seeking to maximize shareholder profits in every decision. But, at least as an ideal, Friedman would argue that executives should serve as perfect agents and should not reduce corporate profits by contributing to social causes. Friedman's critics have focused on the assumptions implicit in Friedman's conceptual framework, one of the more important of which is that executives have no other fiduciary responsibility other that the one they have with their shareholders. The purpose of this paper is to stay within Friedman's conceptual framework and, at the same time, the question Friedman's view on the social responsibility of business, even as an ideal. We do this by focusing directly on how managers will behave, given their status as agents and the extant costs shareholders must incur to closely monitor their executives, and then drawing on important conceptual insights regarding the inefficient provision of community or public goods, best articulated by Friedman himself. Friedman has argued that contributions to many social problems generate positive neighborhood, or spillover, effects. Because of these positive spillovers, a prisoners' dilemma exists with collective rationality calling for everyone to contribute to the solution of a social problem, but with it being irrational from the perspective of each individual to make such a contribution. Once this prisoners' dilemma is recognized, the possibility exists that all shareholders would be worse off if the shareholders of each corporation had the ability to exert perfect control over their corporate agents, thereby preventing them from violating Friedman's prescription for social responsibility by making corporate contributions in excess of profit maximizing levels. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

In fact it has been a topic of common interest to both researchers and top managers since the mid fifties; the focus adjusting to issues and problems of the times. The authors of the article list four themes they believe to be of relevance for future discussion. First, ethics as an instrument of business behavior is entering a new dimension due to negative side effects of economic activities, which are even observed on a global scale and where it is doubtful that governments can adequately manage this complex environment. From this view, ethics becomes a decisive component of efficiency and requires a new way of thinking on the development of the market system and on a new delineation of responsibilities between government and markets. Second, in the process of transformation of the East-European states it seems to be all the more important to emphasize the ethical characteristics which are part of the concept of competition - the gains to the consumer due to the plurality of search and discovery procedures, the capability to correct and absorb wrong decisions, and the specific distributional ethics. Third, business ethics as an element of the firm's ""guiding vision"" has to be incorporated into its corporate culture, which will foster an institutional ethic of the firm - the joint effect of individual ethics within the history of the firm coupled with time and experience. Fourth, conflicting business philosophies must be judged with reference to the process of communication of business ethics. Summing up business ethics has a micro and macro component and is related to the individual firm as well as to the structure of the economic and social order. Ethics will, however, have a limited effect if it is not accompanied by the change in goals, structures and processes. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

In particular, the paper suggests that the use of corporate social responsibility for public relations ends raises moral problems over the motivation of corporations. The paper cautions that the justifications which corporations employ may either be immoral or inaccurate with regard to the empirical evidence gained from a small-scale qualitative study carried out in the UK at a time when the practice of corporate social responsibility was expanding quickly (1989). It is noticeable, in retrospect, that great emphasis is placed upon environmental rather than social responsibility. This implies that organisations are primarily reactive in their development of corporate social responsibility programmes and that they respond to external pressures rather than working out the nature of their corporate responsibilities. It might suggest that corporations only take such actions when they feel compelled to do so by consumerist and environmentalist lobbies. The paper argues that corporations do need to find moral justifications for their moral activities and to ensure that corporate social responsibility practice lives up to the claims made by public relations practitioners. The paper explores the nature of public relations and illustrates how its responsibility for corporate social responsibility extends beyond truthfulness in publicity. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

(Examples are given of institutions that have pioneered these kinds of community-based activities.) To build the new infrastructure, financing must be secured (various sources are discussed), a community-based faculty must be developed, and each institution’s leadership — the medical school dean, the hospital executive, and the department chairmen — must come together around a new agenda and support it materially and psychologically, making whatever changes are needed in the corporate culture.

Many authors addressed the issue in the Third World countries. This paper reviews the literature, focusing on the relationship between the multinational corporations (MNCs) and Third World governments in fulfilling the social responsibility, based on the underlying ethical imperative. There is a growing consensus that both corporations and governments should accept moral responsibility for social welfare and individual interests in their economic transactions. A collaborative relationship is proposed where the MNCs share information based on global experiences and offer input into host government developmental policies, and aid their implementation. The government, in turn, provides a reasonable regulatory environment. This calls for ongoing interactions among officials at all levels of the two institutions, with the local corporate subsidiary playing a pivotal role. The desired conduct of the parties is reinforced by international organizations and other constituents, representing common human concerns across cultures. These relationships are examined and an agenda for policy and action by the MNCs and the Third World governments is developed. The accelerated growth in the number of multinational corporations (MNCs) and their worldwide scope, with concentration of economic and political power draws attention to corporate social responsibility.

Many employers are increasingly acting as ""social arbiters""-regulators of the private conduct, personal behaviors, and habits of their employees. Relying on historical perspectives from (1) an exchange transaction economic view of the employment relationship, and (2) the origins and nature of the corporate form, a framework is developed to analyze the conditions under which employer involvement in employee personal matters may be appropriate. Our criteria generally guide an employer to act conservatively in invoking mandatory policies that affect employees' personal lives unless there is a clear individual employee performance problem or the personal behavior imposes harm on employees or customers. Two tests should be satisfied for mandatory programs: (1) the policy must have a discernible impact on the employee's performance on the current job based on individually based data, or (2) the behavior poses an immediate danger to or has an established discernible impact on the safety of co-workers or customers.

It's not that managers dislike the idea of doing the right thing. As University of Toronto Assistant Professor Andrew Stark argues, far too many business ethicists just haven't offered them the practical advice they need. Before business ethics became a formal discipline, advocates of corporate social responsibility claimed that the market would ultimately reward ethical behavior. But ethics and interests did not always intersect so fruitfully in the real world. And when they did not, managers were left in the dark to grope for the right ethical course. In the 1970s, the brand-new field of business ethics came onto the scene to address this issue. Critical of the ""ethics pays"" approach, academics held that ethics and interests can and do conflict. Still, scholars took an equally unrealistic line. To them, a manager's motivation could be either altruistic or self-interested, but never both. In short, ethicists still weren't addressing the difficult moral dilemmas that managers face on a day-to-day basis, and only recently have they begun to do so. After some initial stumbles, ethicists are getting their hands dirty and seriously considering the costs of doing the right thing. Finally, a new business ethics is emerging that acknowledges and accepts the messy world of mixed motives. As a result, novel concepts are springing up: moderation, pragmatism, minimalism, among others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,"administrative personnel; article; Canada; commercial phenomena; ethics; organization; social behavior; social psychology; standard; United States; Administrative Personnel; Canada; Commerce; Decision Making, Organizational; Ethics, Institutional; Social Responsibility; Social Values; United States"

While effective strategies help implement ethical decisions that are formulated in good faith, ostensibly value-neutral control mechanisms can indirectly affect the substantive nature of policies and decisions themselves. This article examines the effectiveness of various corporate social responsibility implementation strategies. It also addresses the effects of implementation choices on the substantive formulation of ethical decisions and policies. Implementation and evaluation of corporate social responsibility programs through models of responsiveness are integrated into the social policy cycle using four tools: strategic control and performance control approaches, and hierarchical control and contractual control structures. The choices made among these forms of control approaches and structures, which as implementation mechanisms are typically considered to be value-free devices, may affect the substance of corporate social responsibility content. Hierarchical control structures, which use outside directors, tend to be associated with performance control approaches, and are biased towards applying utilitarian approaches to ethical decision making. Contractual control structures are compatable with strategic control approaches, and generally favor the application of principle-based approaches to ethical decision-making. Both the content and the quality of ethical decisions will be affected by differences between hierarchical and contractual control. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

The governments of France and England moved forward expeditiously with testing and approval of the drug. The legal developments surrounding the introduction of RU-486 in France and England as well as American, French, and English legal issues of corporate responsibility for licensing valuable drugs and compulsory licensing are outlined. The French government on October 28, 1988, ordered the company Roussel-Uclaf to resume plans to distribute RU-486 out of concern for public health and stated that RU-486 was the moral property of women. Roussel-Uclaf agreed to resume plans for distribution. RU-486 suits were finally decided in late 1990 and early 1991 by the State Council, France's highest administrative court, which issued a series of significant rulings. The French government issued new rules prohibiting the use of RU-486 by women who are heavy smokers or over 35 years old and modifying the dose of prostaglandin to be administered because of an RU-486-related death of an overweight 31-year old woman. In England, RU-486 was initially approved in July 1991. The conditions set were similar to those in France: the drug would have be used within 9 weeks of amenorrhea, as opposed to 7 in France; women over 35 or moderate to heavy smokers would be ineligible; and visits 36-48 hours later would be necessary to have a prostaglandin administered with check ups 7-10 days later. The hostility of the current US administration to the introduction of RU-486 blocks access to the drug. In 1989, the Food and Drug Administration placed reluctant to enter the American market. Under the Bush administration there is little possibility that the American government will act and take an active role in facilitating access to RU-486.",,"abortive agent; hormone; hormone antagonist; mifepristone; article; biology; consumer; developed country; drug approval; drug industry; Economic Factors; endocrine system; ethics; Europe; female; France; Genetics and Reproduction; Government Regulation; human; Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990; International Aspects; law; law suit; Legal Approach; legal aspect; licensing; Macroeconomic Factors; Mediterranean Countries; North America; Northern America; Northern Europe; Obstacles; organization and management; patient; patient selection; physiology; Political Activity; pregnancy; Product Approval; Right to Life Movement; Roussel Uclaf; Ru-486; Selection For Treatment; social behavior; socioeconomics; standard; Standards; therapeutic abortion; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe; Western Hemisphere; Americas; Biology; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Endocrine System; England; Europe; France; Genetics and Reproduction; Government Regulation; Great Britain; Hormone Antagonists; Hormones; Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990; International Aspects; Legal Approach; Legislation; Licensing; Litigation; Macroeconomic Factors; Mediterranean Countries; North America; Northern America; Northern Europe; Obstacles; Organization And Administration; Physiology; Political Activity; Pregnant Women; Private Sector; Product Approval; Right to Life Movement; Roussel Uclaf; RU-486; Ru-486; Selection For Treatment; Standards; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe; Abortifacient Agents, Steroidal; Abortion, Legal; Consumer Organizations; Drug Approval; Drug Industry; England; Ethics; Female; France; Human; Licensure; Mifepristone; Patient Selection; Patients; Pregnancy; Social Responsibility; United States; Value of Life"

It is based on interviews with specialist practitioners at the beginning and end of the 1980s. Policy contexts are examined to identify the expectations held of social services departments within a corporate responsibility. Analysis of what social workers do in working with homeless families highlights practical support through the homelessness process and dilemmas over child protection. The guidance on the new children and community care legislation continues the marginalization of this specialism, which is variously misunderstood, misrepresented, or ignored from the housing policy and research side, whilst on the social services side, although formally ignored, it is in practice expected to discharge statutory responsibilities in an area fraught with conflicts. © 1992 The British Association of Social Workers.",,"Family; Great Britain; Homelessness; Social Work; Welfare Policy"

This paper proposes that a necessary step toward preventing and treating such misconduct is the understanding of the explanations, called accounts, given by the actor. We argue that the theorizing and findings in the literature on accounts can be organized into a 2×2 matrix framework. The first dimension centers on whether or not the actor admits that some net harm is done by the act, and the second consists of whether or not the actor admits responsibility. When both are admitted (cell 1), the account is a concession, while denial of both constitutes a refusal (cell 4). Admitting responsibility but not harm equates to a justification (cell 2), and the opposite condition is an excuse (cell 3). Building on this matrix, we specify a typology of explanations within each cell which will highlight inter-cell differences. Finally, we explore the implications of this analysis for managers, regulators, and the public. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

When corporations have rights individual rights become meaningless. While corporations may need some form of protection to make them financially feasible investments, they need not be given the full protection of rights which are assigned to the individual. A much attenuated version of corporate rights is warranted. I would argue against Werhane's notion of a corporation possessing ""secondary rights"" which can be asserted only after the claims of individual rights have been met.Ibid., p. 62. One solution to the problems raised in this essay would be to ascribe rights to individuals only. This could occur without interfering with the financial independence of the corporation by a simple legal prescription that individuals within a corporation be held responsible for their activities and that the corporation p e r se not be blamed for individual actions. This is consistent with the judgments against the Nazi war criminals who were denied the defense of justifying their actions on the basis of following orders. Responsibility for those actions which are the result of the workings of the ""invisible hand"" cannot be ascribed to any individual or group of individuals. Donaldson is helpful on this point in recommending an ""office of social responsibility"" be created as part of the corporation to monitor those actions which otherwise escape scrutiny.Donaldson, Corporations and Morality, p. 207. A more radical solution is to restructure the corporation in such a way as to introduce the element of democracy in the workplace. Opponents would argue that such a practice would diminish the profit-making potential of the corporation by limiting the discretion of the corporate officers in making decisions. Similar arguments have been advanced against the democratic state. Yet democratic states have proven to be viable institutions capable of effective action and demonstrably more survivable than the authoritarian regimes which are the analogs of the corporation. Given the current hierarchical structure of the corporation and its ability to dissolve in the face of questions of responsibility, individual accountability is the only viable solution. This requires that members of the corporation not find cover behind the ""invisible hand."" This in turn necessitates the granting of a greater degree of discretionary power to corporate functionaries at all levels. We cannot be responsible for a state of affairs over which we have no effective control. The courts would make the ultimate decision as to the assignation of responsibility in particular cases of corporate crime, with the stipulation that the ascription be to an individual and not ""the corporation."" By making corporate officers individually responsible for their actions a much more effective deterrent to corporate crimes would be created. Corporations can easily afford most of the fines that are imposed on them, and corporations cannot be put in prison. The view of the corporation advanced here puts it in a legal and moral position greatly inferior to that of the individual as well as the state. Consequently, corporate needs and welfare must remain a tertiary concern. The rights of the individual must figure primarily, and the welfare of the state as preserver of those rights secondarily, in social policy decisions. The libertarian vision of the corporation is therefore a misguided result of the conflation of the corporation and the individual in the legal and moral realms. Corporations and individuals are ontologically distinct entities and must be recognized as such. The failure to do so has enabled corporations to abrogate individual rights with legal and moral impunity. Such a situation is inconsistent with the demands of a rights-based democracy. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Wall Street analysts praise the company's outstanding financial performance. Innovative programs such as the first corporate child-care center and public service scholarships support Stride Rite's reputation as one of the most responsible employers and corporate citizens in the United States. Behind Stride Rite's good performance are the building blocks of corporate character: a legacy of quality and service and a leader committed to keeping that legacy lively. When Stride Rite shipped its first children's shoes in 1919, they came with the company's commitment ""to produce an honest quality product in an honest way and deliver it as promised."" For Arnold Hiatt, that commitment has been the driving force behind the company's evolution from manufacturing into marketing and product development as well as the guiding principle in its relations with consumers, dealers, suppliers, and employees. But Stride Rite's corporate character is also a reflection of Hiatt himself. In his early 20s, Hiatt fled a management training program ""designed to make carnivores"" out of its new employees and bought Blue Star Shoes, a small manufacturing company that had gone into Chapter 11. Through experience and ""stumbling around,"" he built Blue Star's sales to $5 million-and got a practical education in management, markets, and human nature that has proved equally useful in running Stride Rite.",,"article; child; commercial phenomena; day care; economic aspect; economics; financial management; human; industry; methodology; organization; organization and management; personnel management; public relations; social behavior; standard; United States; Child; Child Day Care Centers; Commerce; Community-Institutional Relations; Economic Competition; Financial Management; Human; Industry; Organizational Culture; Organizational Innovation; Personnel Management; Social Responsibility; United States"

The 1983 Code of Canon Law provides bishops with guidelines to help establish the Catholicity of a Catholic hospital that has affiliated with a non-Catholic hospital. The diocesan bishop exercises his authority through a threefold ministry of teaching, sanctifying, and governing. These ministries stand as a reminder of his decision-making authority in matters that affect the spiritual state and growth of those entrusted to his care. Catholic identity, as it is presented in the Code of Canon Law, can be determined through the presence of a relationship between an institution and ecclesiastical authorities, the legal establishment of the entity, and a degree of control that the Church exercises over the institution. When evaluating a possible merger of joint venture between a Catholic hospital and a non-Catholic hospital that is performing procedures not in accord with Catholic Church teaching, the diocesan bishop must consider what limits must be observed. The good effects of the affiliation must be intended and direct, and the harmful effects must be perceived as unintended and indirect. The difficulties in determining and protecting the identity of Catholic hospitals in possible mergers or joint ventures should not prevent facilities from considering alternative forms of corporate structures.

In light of these challenges and interests, it also explores answers to the question ""What is to be done?"" The occurrence of MNCs' operations in culturally pluralistic societies suggest that they use, as the basis for a corporation-formulated regional code of conduct, a value-based corporate social policy process. That process should embody utilitarian and situation ethics in the exercise of MNCs' prima facie operations and of their responsibilities to society. For the African normative environment, the appeal of this approach is substantiated by the notion that both utilitarian and situation ethics are at once consistent with the region's investment codes, development interests, and value systems. But more than that, utilitarian and situation ethics are consistent with corporate social policy process and can assist MNCs to meet effectively their social responsibilities by helping them reverse the economic stagnation of most of the continent. However, because deontological (that is, Kantian) ethics emphasize autonomous actions that satisfy individual goals, they are largely at odds with sub-Saharan African value systems that typically emphasize the ethnic group (heteronomy) rather than the self. MNCs would, therefore, do well to de-emphasize their use in the region. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Kenichi Ohmae, chairman of McKinsey and Company in Tokyo, addresses ""The Perils of Protectionism."" Ohmae argues that the old definitions of national boundaries and corporate interests reflect obsolete economic theories. The real test of national well-being, Ohmae suggests, should be the economic welfare of a nation's citizens. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, economist and former director of the Economic Policy Council in New York, analyzes the survey in terms of ""The Human Resource Deficit."" According to Hewlett, four principles should guide corporate strategies in the 1990s: human resource development should move up the scale of corporate priorities; a family-friendly workplace will attract and keep talented workers; companies will take limited direct responsibility for training and education; the private sector will promote public investment in social issues. James E. Austin, the Richard P. Chapman Professor of Business at the Harvard Business School, writes about ""The Developing-Country Difference."" In developing countries, Austin observes, managers display attitudes and follow practices that diverge from those in developed nations. In particular, the role of government, investments in education and technology, and environmental concerns set these nations apart. Michel Crozier, president of the Centre de Sociologie des Organisations in Paris, writes about ""The Changing Organization."" In the 1990s, Crozier argues, managers need to break from old management theories and practice, questioning hierarchy, control, distance, access to information-the whole managerial system.",,"administrative personnel; article; commercial phenomena; economic aspect; information processing; personnel management; United States; Administrative Personnel; Commerce; Data Collection; Economic Competition; Evaluation Studies; Personnel Management; United States"

In relation to corporate job creation, it is considered that many companies could improve the effectiveness of their support through better organization, targeting and focusing on agencies' needs. In regard to the issues facing agencies, the authors conclude that many problems revolve around the question of sponsorship. Much of the responsibility of fund raising rests with agency staff who, in some cases, have little idea about how to effectively approach companies, and yet have to devote a considerable amount of time to the task. Looking to the future, Metcalf, Pearson and Martin believe agencies will face increased financial pressures as charitable demands on companies grow, whilst government policies towards local authorities result in a reduction in agency support from that source. A consequence of these pressures, they believe, will be a reduction in the number of agencies with the development of regional consortia and networks to share resources and co-ordinate activities. In the second article, Steve Martin, Mike Tricker and Tony Bovaird of Aston Business School present the findings of their study of the effectiveness of Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) as a vehicle for co-ordinating economic and social initiatives in twenty-seven Rural Development Areas designated by the Development Commission in 1984. It is considered that to date the RDPs have had a positive impact on the areas concerned through improved co-ordination, bringing about changes in policies and practices amongst agencies and levering extra resources from the public and voluntary sectors. However, they conclude it remains to be seen, in the longer term, how successful the RDPs will be in bending agencies' main programmes towards rural priorities, in attracting substantial private sector funds and in developing truly integrated and innovative rural development strategies. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To establish ""ownership"" of the standards, WFSI wanted to involve as many people as possible in the planning process. Center staff established a 25-member working task force with broad representation of disciplines and system institutions, then prepared a position paper to serve as a basis for the formulation of the standards. The paper examined current issues in corporate ethics, the theoretical basis of corporate ethics, the appropriateness of corporate ethics for Catholic-sponsored institutions, and the role ethics standards play in an institutional setting. Staff then prepared the first draft of corporate standards. At the first workshop in October 1988, task force members critiqued the draft and modified the proposed corporate standards. Staff sent the draft for critique to a total of 157 persons throughout the system and encouraged them to pass it around to get the advice of others.

A newer concept, the Corporate Social Policy Process, which focuses on the institutionalization within business organizations of processes facilitating individual and organizational reflection and choice regarding the moral significance of personal and organizational action together with a consideration of the likely consequences of such action, provides analytical linkages between Business Ethics and Corporate Good Citizenship which can be useful to business scholars and operating managers alike.

So it enlisted a nearby organization, the Wilder Foundation, and went into partnership as Altcare.

The program originates with a general introduction designed to familiarize students with literature and concepts pertaining to professional and business ethics and corporate social responsibility. This may be accomplished through orientation sessions, readings, packages, short classes and lectures. The key segment of the plan is to have ethics modules developed and systematically integrated throughout key business courses. In the project experiment, sample modules were developed for courses in introductory marketing, introductory management, corporate finance and business policy. The modules are designed to respond to the concerns of functional business faculty that they cannot be sufficiently authoritative in teaching ethics and that inserting coverage of ethics will displace critically important topics in their already crowded courses.

Scheffler posits and defends a moral theory which is intended to be neither act-consequentialist nor fully agent-centered. Instead, it provides an agent-centered analysis of moral thinking: one that, unlike consequentialist theories, respects the personal integrity of the moral agent. In this paper I shall do the following: (1) Sketch some of the general points of Scheffler's proposal; (2) Apply Scheffler's ethical theory to the matter of corporate social responsibility; and (3) Raise some objections to this Schefflerian corporate social responsibility theory, along with some modifications of this hybrid theory of corporate social responsibility which are intended to evade such criticisms. The significance of this paper is that it shows that Scheffler's quite innovative ethical theory is problematic as a foundation for a theory of corporate social responsibility. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

He attempts to do this by moving from Friedman's paradigm characterizing a socially responsible executive as willful and disloyal to a different paradigm, i.e., one emphasizing the consultative and consensus-building role of a socially responsible executive. Mulligan's critique misses the point, first, because even consensus-building executives act contrary to the will of minority shareholders, but even more importantly, because he assumes that the mandate of a shareholder majority brings legitimacy to efforts of corporate managers to utilize corporate wealth in solving social problems. It is the role of our democratic institutions to deal with national agenda issues such as inflation, unemployment, and pollution, not that of the private sector. Corporations and private individuals do have a role to play in enhancing the quality of the human environment, however, and the author suggests a coherent means of developing that role in an effort ""rescue"" corporate social responsibility from Mulligan no less than from Friedman. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,

Our response to the medically indigent is perhaps the paradigmatic way we can mediate Christ and Christian values. In the last century the Church's social teaching has reiterated the understanding that Christ identifies with the poor and the underprivileged. The fundamental challenge seems to be how to move this ""option for the poor"" rom theological scholarship and reflection to healthcare ministry. Poverty and the lack of access to healthcare need to be seen not simply as the problem of individuals but as structural problems. Witnessing, education, and acting on behalf of the poor require the whole healthcare community's cooperation. Individual efforts are multiplied when they are a real part of a ""corporate culture"" genuinely committed to the poor. One such corporate effort was undertaken by the Sisters of Bon Secours when they developed their Ministerial Stand on Care of the Poor in 1984. A task force published 32 recommendations to aid facility managers in carrying out the statement. Mission committees were formed at Bon Secours Health System facilities to oversee implementation of the recommendations.

The first issue has four sub-issues: (1) Is apartheid immoral? (2) Do corporations have any social responsibility? (3) Do the rights of South African blacks concerning the issue of apartheid outweigh those of the corporations to do business freely? (4) Are the benefits to blacks greater with divestment than without? The term ""benefits"" is then defined in both macro and micro dimensions. A ""NO"" answer to any one of the several questions would lead to the conclusion that there is no moral obligation for U.S. firms presently in South Africa to divest. The analysis presented will conclude that the answer to the first three questions is ""yes"". Further, the answer to the first half of the fourth question (macro benefits) will be determined to be ""no"". The micro benefit issue, namely, the nature of the product produced, will then be evaluated using a model based on which group benefits most from the item produced. Assuming corporations are successfully meeting their moral obligations under questions # 2 and # 3, then the general conclusion will be reached that firms producing items of direct benefit to the black community should stay; firms producing items of direct benefit to the government should divest; and no generalized model for analysis can be assumed for firms producing items which benefit both groups equally. Finally, a brief discussion is presented of the issue of obligation for positive action against apartheid, both political and economic, on the part of U.S. corporations. © 1988 D.

Aspects covered include tariffs, energy management, manpower management, finance and various factors affecting system efficiency. The industry's marketing philosophy of promoting cost effective uses of electricity is highlighted as are the responsibilities of having 21 million customers.

In Colombia these forces have been successfully tamed within a coherent model of 'neo-Christendom' -- a form of conservative modernization in which tradition has been consciously wielded, the Church has combined organizational reform with the reassertion of a vertical authority structure, and the interpretation of the Church's social responsibilities has been limited to support of governmental reform and the teaching of general principles. This corporate control over its own ranks has probably been the Church's major contribution to the stability of the oligarchical regime. The Church has become dependent on the regime's ability to preserve relative openness and legitimacy, both of which appear to be declining with the continuing challenge of armed guerrillas and the growing authority of the army. -from Author",,

Thus, hazard communication is more than a theory or moral imperative; it is now rooted in explicit and enforceable legal doctrines. Moreover, hazard communication is not an isolated development: it has broad implications for corporate management. The duty to warn imposed on industry carries with it two concomitant duties for industrial officials: the duty to identify hazards through reasonable efforts and the use of expertise so that the duty to warn will be meaningful; and the duty to act diligently to control or reduce the hazards, once they have been identified, so that the duty to warn will not be dispositive on the matter of corporate responsibility. Thus, three corporate functions for risk management are inextricably linked. Exercise of their rights under these doctrines, and of other authority for the right to know by persons who perceive they may be at risk provides the continuing pressure on industry and agencies to comply with these duties, and assures corporate accountability in carrying out the duties to identify, warn and act.

Compensation structures should be based on responsibility, not organization affiliation, to avoid the perception that corporate-level positions are always worth more than affiliate-level ones. To accomplish this, administrators must identify characteristics shared by key corporate and affiliate positions, including having direct responsibility for implementing board policies and taking actions that directly affect the organization's viability. Position titles and salary structure should reflect similar responsibility levels. When analyzing salary surveys, administrators must determine affiliates' autonomy within the corporation; institutions with direct corporate supervision may have lower compensation levels than free-standing ones. Corporate executive compensation may emphasize fringe benefits rather than base salary; differentials here should also reflect position responsibility. Incentive awards, a growing factor in executive compensation, should be based on predetermined, quantifiable objectives. Awards may vary because corporate, affiliate, and proprietary executives have different goals. The responsibility for the organization's compensation program belongs to the corporate board. It can best discharge this responsibility through an executive compensation committee. The committee's duties include evaluating the CEO, establishing a compensation philosophy, ensuring consistency in program application, and integrating compensation with long-range plans.

In considering medical peace groups as examples, we have studied the ways that corporate and philanthropic funding have shaped the course of activism. Our methods have included: review of the Foundations Grant Index from 1974-1983; analysis of corporations' and foundations' criteria for grants in the categories of peace, arms control, and disarmament; interviews with leaders of activist organizations and with foundation officials; and our own experiences in the peace movement. Corporate interests in preventing nuclear war stem from a concern for global stability in which world markets may expand, and from a hope to frame issues posed by the peace movement in a way that will not challenge basic structures of power and finance. Several general features make peace groups respectable and attractive to philanthropies: an uncritical stance toward corporate participation in the arms race; a viewpoint that the main danger of nuclear war stems from a profound, bilateral conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union; and a single-issue focus that does not deal with the many related problems reflecting the injustices of capitalism. The two major medical groups working for peace, Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), have accomplished many goals; however, their adherence to subtle criteria of respectability and their dependence on philanthropic funding have limited the scope of their activism. The struggle for peace can not suceed without fundamental changes in the corporate system that initiates, maintains, and promotes the arms race.",,"atomic warfare; economic aspect; funding; health hazard; human; organization and management; peace corps; short survey; Financial Management; Fund Raising; Human; International Cooperation; Nuclear Warfare; Public Policy; Risk; Social Responsibility; United States"

The recently established Association for Surgical Education and its expanding membership have performed in an excellent fashion in addressing the objectives, content, process, and evaluation of surgical clerkships. There are several factors that influence the quality of a clerkship that are not readily subjected to measurement but that have a significant impact on the environment and conduct of clerkships. Criticism, mainly from the academic community, has been directed recently to distortions of the learning process and the continuing use of traditional teaching methods that do not serve medical educational programs and students optimally. More attention should be paid to the principle that a surgical clerkship should be designed to provide an elemental comprehension of the major surgical diseases irrespective of how the students will select multiple specialties for their careers. The quality of a clinical teaching program is influenced in a realistic way by the quality of care provided to the patients. The image of the staff, especially the resident staff, plays an important role in affecting students' incentives, the development of self-discipline, their attitudes toward patients and families, and the ultimate selection of careers. As much responsibility as possible for the diagnosis of disease and the care of patients should be given to students under close supervision and always with the best interests of the patients in mind.

In an effort to meet this challenge, 600 corporate employees were surveyed and compared with respect to the allotment of time to work, leisure, and self/family care activities; health risk factors; perceived health; and activity satisfaction. The results of the study indicated that the employees participating in the corporate health and fitness programs were not the high risk individuals who consume the majority of the corporate medical dollar. The role of the occupational therapist in meeting the needs of high risk employees is discussed. A brief review of the literature addresses research efforts in the area of health promotion in industry and the role of the occupational therapist in disease prevention. The appropriateness of occupational therapy education, training and theory in relation to health promotion programs and the utilization of the five occupational performance components in the evaluation of employee populations is outlined. Finally, the role of the occupational therapist working in specific areas of health promotion is reviewed, including: back pain reduction, substance abuse treatment, cardiac fitness/rehabilitation and hypertension control, smoking cessation, weight reduction, stress management, industrial accident and injury prevention, and self-responsibility for health instruction. © 1985 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,"economic aspect; health care; health education; health promotion; human; insurance; job satisfaction; occupational therapy; organization and management; prevention; short survey; social aspect; therapy"

Yet precedents for such an advocacy role exist in several areas: the development of regulations that protect handicapped newborns from discriminatory decisions of nontreatment and the institutional committees that review research protocols or formulate ""do not resuscitate"" policies. The need for IECs to take up social justice issues is based in the concepts of autonomy--the capacity for freedom of choice--and relationality--the capacity to known and to love. All the human ethical questions of freedom, well-being, and justice emerge in the health care setting, where the concepts of autonomy and relationality are intently focused on and sometimes threatened. If a health care institution is to address such questions as affirmative action policies in financing and purchasing, the just pricing of medical care, the ethics of treatment decisions, and the right to medical care, it needs a forum in which to deliberate, collaborate, and discern responsible corporate moral action. For example, an ethics committee can: Call for correction of problems of sexism, racism, and classism in health care institutions; Address government regulations in a way that enables a better understanding of professional commitments; and Lead facilities to discover ways to network with others to meet the needs of the populations they serve.

The increased presence of foreign corporations and the generally strategic significance of such presence for host countries, has increasingly confronted both sides with the need to develop guidelines governing the conduct of such operations. The new voluntary approach to guideline development suggested here is based on the proposition that the fundamental aim of business activity is the satisfaction of socially desirable needs. Under this approach, MNC's should attempt to operate in a socially desirable manner in all countries of operations. Social desirability determination will be made on the basis of whether activities in particular countries will be seen, by majority concensus of all publics on which corporate activity impacts, to bring about welfare improvements in the countries concerned. Periodic public opinion polls, or more informal methods in the less developed countries, are seen to provide the necessary inputs for the development of overall corporate guidelines for action, which in turn will influence strategic corporate decisions. The long run benefits resulting from such conduct are seen to outweigh temporary gains that could accrue to corporations through the pursuit of profitable but socially undesirable activities. © 1982 D.

This is followed by a consideration of how responsibility ascriptions to different types of collectivities are to be understood vis à vis those to individual group members. It is suggested that the ""medical profession"" (distinctly different from the ""medical team"" and the ""hospital corporation"") is an aggregate collectivity. That is, the ""medical profession"" consists of the ""sum"" of the identities of its membership, which can be shown to entail that if the ""profession"" is held responsible for something, each of its members is responsible, in some way, for it. This is to suggest that the ""medical profession"" is not a shield that hides individual medical practitioners from responsibility for the general state of health care. Quite the contrary. The use of the name of the aggregate in such a responsibility ascription puts each and every one of them ""on call.""Two types of collectivities, aggregate and conglomerate, are analyzed. Moral responsibility cannot be ascribed to aggregates because they are comprised of individuals who have little or no relationship to each other. In contrast, conglomerates are comprised of individuals within an organizational system that has a ""corporate internal decision structure""; the conglomerate can be held morally responsible for its actions without blame being necessarily placed on individual members. The medical profession is considered to be an aggregate collectivity, in which each individual practitioner bears at least some responsibility for the delivery of health care.",,"Accountability; article; Bioethics and Professional Ethics; medical ethics; morality; patient care; philosophy; social behavior; society; Accountability; Bioethics and Professional Ethics; Society; Ethics, Medical; Moral Obligations; Patient Care Team; Philosophy, Medical; Social Responsibility; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

What is interesting in the history of the corporate-social-responsibility doctrine is that, within roughly three decades, it has achieved a status almost coequal with the bottom-line philosophy which, in the past, provided legitimacy to corporate decision making. Nevertheless, debate over corporate responsibilities continues. Two factors explain why: 1) corporate performance is perceived by some as not matching corporate rhetoric and 2) the ""battle of definitions"" continues. The first factor will be determined within the next five years because the Reagan Administration, by curtailing government activities, places more responsibility on the private sector. The definitional issue of CSR and CSR2 (responsibility versus response) is not likely to be resolved soon but the strengths of the ""response model"" do not equal the strengths of the ""responsibility model."" Responsibility is a moral term and response a psychological one: the American people ask their leaders to behave as ""virtuous agents."". Moral decision rendered in complex situations-and on behalf of countless others-will lead people to define ""correctness"" differently, as the ""Poletown incident"" in Detroit amply illustrates.

The analysis presented in this paper, however, leads to the conclusion that this role for accounting standards is not likely to be beneficial. The conclusion is based on the fact that the required measurements for useful standards cannot generally be made. This inherent limitation is absolute with respect to social responsibility concerns. With respect to corporate governance, accounting standards might be useful, primarily for reporting potentially fraudulent dealings and similar misuses of shareholder's assets by corporate managers. But even then, the cost of an accounting standard, ex ante, is likely to exceed its benefits to shareholders. © 1982.",,

The idea ""remains peripheral to the mainstream of economic thought."". Corporate social responsibility involves more than simply being a law-abiding corporate citizen.

The paper examines the meaning of corporate self-reliance: business enterprises assuming responsibility for the consequences of their operation in the social as well as the physical environment by forming partnerships with local communities and families. The paper presents four strategies for the development of corporate self-reliance. The first is the role of labor-management committees as change agents for improving the quality of community and work life. The second strategy is worker-ownership as a constructive community response to plant shut-downs. The third strategy involves employer-based family support systems. The fourth is participative work as a means of enhancing personal and corporate competence resulting in enhanced morale and productivity, essential components of corporate self-reliance. In all four examples, the underlying theme is the importance of investing in human resources. In the course of explicating these phenomena, the paper considers the following related issues: Japanese concepts of corporate responsibility for employee and community welfare, outcome measures beyond job satisfaction, community impact, and the costs of change for individuals and groups.

Mental health planners thought that the costs of state hospital care could be reduced by discharging patients into the community. For state governments, this involved a shift of costs and responsibility to the federal government. This shift was accompanied by an increase in cost-effective planning at both state and federal levels. Cost-effective planning uses corporate-style standardization techniques to provide precise, measured types of treatment to certain categories of patients. Such planning is primarily oriented to balanced ledgers of the government budget, rather than meeting specific human needs. The shift in costs also increases profits in the private sector. This is most noticeable in the nursing and boarding home industry where entrepreneurs derive large returns from a newly custodialism mainly funded by government reimbursements. The institutional overuse of psychiatric drugs is continued in community programs. Cost-effective approaches also involve firing mental health staff and increasing the workload of those remaining. Community mental health centers and state hospital deinstitutionalization programs have largely failed to meet most of their promises such as noninstitutional treatment, more humane care, prevention, and rehabilitation. These failures have produced the beginning of a delegitimation of the new mental health approaches. This delegitimation is also used as part of more general attacks on social services so prevalent in this period of economic crisis. This reinforces the reliance on cost-effective plans which do not benefit clients. It also poses the danger of increasing the number of persons classified as psychological misfit among the marginal underclass. Even though this is an unintended effect, it can then be used to deflect onto these victims popular resentment against big business and the government. Further, the growth of such a misfit group, along with other types of social decay, may prompt an increase in the already growing forms of social control psychotechnology such as psychosurgery.",,"article; custody; deinstitutionalization; economics; health care policy; human; mental disease; mental health service; social psychology; standard; Community Mental Health Services; Custodial Care; Deinstitutionalization; Health Policy; Human; Mental Disorders; Social Values"

Underlying these compromises was his theory of corporate socialism, which influenced how he believed the AIEE should participate in the professionalization of electrical engineering. Since he thought the AIEE's main purpose was to improve the corporation's technical or production function, the Institute's major role was the advancement of engineering knowledge. In order to perform this role effectively, he thought the AIEE should maintain high membership standards, which meant engineering rather than business control of the Institute. When other AIEE activities, such as standardization, ethics, and social responsibility, came into conflict with corporate interests, he thought the Institute should cooperate with business interests while retaining its autonomy.

Of immediate concern to a broad spectrum of Canadian society is the inadequacy of many of today's information systems to meet the test of social acceptability. In many cases, the interfaces between people and machine systems are underdeveloped, causing problems in error correction, human frustration, misuses or abuses of personal information, and, to a lesser extent, invasions of personal privacy. The paper suggests that the designers of today's machine-oriented ""data processing"" systems must accept a large share of the responsibility for these problems because the human component, which should be present in every ""information processing"" system, had frequently been overlooked. Serious long term social and economic dislocations are likely if Canada fails to align overall social and economic policies with the on-going transition towards the ""information economy and society"". The paper examines the growing confrontations between labour and consumers, sellers and buyers, state and society and among the regional, national and international economies arising out of the pervasive use of computer/communications technologies. The social implications of national productivity and job exports are examined. The point is made that the social implications of the use of these technologies are much broader than privacy and encompass economic, political, legal and other social issues which cannot be resolved in isolation. It is suggested that in analysing these issues full consideration be given to technological, economic and social aspects. A number of different approaches are outlined to initiate broader discussion of these issues; among these a data protection approach. Three basic requirements are introduced in an attempt to formulate guidelines for dealing with national and corporate data protection requirements. Collaboration and co-operation among Canadian government, industry and professional associations is proposed as the most desirable approach to meeting requirements in this area. The avoidance of premature legislative measures of the kind visible in the United States is recommended.

One reason for these disturbing developments, the authors suggest, is that corporate management has been too concerned with traditionally ″masculine″ concerns of profit and efficiency and has ignored such ″feminine″ concerns as preservation of the environment and the upholding of human rights, viewpoints that are making a strong resurgence in American society. The authors believe that the addition of women in management would encourage managements to give strong support to both these concerns and, in so doing, help reverse the current decline in public support of business.",,"INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT"

Striking differences were found in the manner in which the identical drug, marketed by the identical company of its foreign affiliate, was described to physicians in the United States and to physicians in Latin America. In the United States, the listed indications were usually few in number, while the contraindications, warnings, and potential adverse reactions were given in extensive detail. In Latin America, the listed indications were far more numerous, while the hazards were usually minimized, glossed over, or totally ignored. The differences were not simply between the United States on the one hand and all the Latin American countries on the other. There were substantial differences within Latin America, with the same global company telling one story in Mexico, another in Central America, a third in Ecuador and Colombia, and yet another in Brazil. The companies have sought to defend these practices by contending that they are not breaking any Latin American laws. In some countries, however, such promotion is in clear violation of the law. The corporate ethics and social responsibilities concerned here call for examination and action.",,"epidemiology; ethics; law; legal aspect; prescription; Empirical Approach; Federal Government; Government Regulation; Health Hazards; Information Dissemination; International Aspects; Latin America; Obligations To Society; Risks And Benefits; Survey; United States; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Advertising; Arthritis; Chloramphenicol; Contraceptives, Oral; Drug Industry; Drug Information Services; Ethics; Female; Human; Latin America; Legislation, Drug; Pregnancy; Prescriptions, Drug; Sampling Studies; United States"

The emphasis in the public’s inquiry was not on the technical competence, but on the social responsibility of the corporate and plant physician. Repeatedly, the question was asked: “Whose agent is the occupational physician — the employer’s or the employee’s?” It is evident that the basic ethical and moral responsibility of all physicians, including occupational physicians, is to safeguard the health of the individual — the worker. There is, however, another consideration — “the health of the enterprise” — in which the employee earns his livelihood and which retains and pays for the services of the occupational physician. The obligation of the occupational physician to the “enterprise” is examined and the areas of conflict and agreement with his professional activities are discussed. If the occupational physician carries out his ethical and professional responsibility, the single greatest disservice he can do to both his employer and to the workers he serves would be his failure to be competent in the areas of modern scientific and technical knowledge needed to diagnose and advise properly on the health of the entire enterprise. Areas of technical competence which a modern occupational physician should master and the means of obtaining this information are explored. © 1977 The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",,"article; economics; environmental health; industry; medical ethics; occupational medicine; United States; employee; employer; ethics; morality; responsibility; Economics; Environmental Health; Ethics, Medical; Industry; Occupational Medicine; United States"

Although there appears to be some confusion in the extant literature regarding the definition and scope of certain internal audit efforts, this research provides new evidence that major U.S. companies are engaging in unprecedented experiments into the use of auditing as a tool for enforcing management and social accountability. This is a movement away from the traditional financial audit which is frequently assumed to fully circumscribe the internal audit function. The implications for implementing heightened standards of corporate accountability should be of interest to audit committees of boards of directors, corporate management, investors, consumers, and future researchers. © 1977.",,

However, some observers [1,8,12] believe that executives have become less interested in social responsibilities and more disillusioned by the results of the social-responsibility era. The apparent change in executives' attitudes leads to several questions that need answering: Has corporate experimentation with social programs convinced managers that the pursuit of social responsibility is basically inimical to the quest for profits? Is the business community's commitment to the philosophy of corporate social responsibility moribund? Is the idea destined to die of benign neglect? Conclusions pertaining to these questions are developed in this article. The analysis includes the formulation of a theoretical basis for evaluating and resolving the central issues which confound executive decision making as it relates to corporate social responsibility. © 1976.",,
